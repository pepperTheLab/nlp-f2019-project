All scientists must now, to some extent, be data scientists--they must manage, analyze, and communicate about data in the context of collaborative, reproducible research. Furthermore, future professionals will need to have data science skills to deal with urgent problems in agriculture, environmental management, and public health. However, most students in biology and environmental science graduate with little data science experience. The BEDE Network will help address this need by focusing on developing the technical skills, curricular resources, and pedagogical confidence of undergraduate instructors so that they can more intentionally include core data science skills in their classes and labs. By engaging an inclusive community of scientists and biology and environmental science educators, BEDE will develop training workshops, curricular materials, and best practices that can be adopted by educators at almost any institution and in almost any course.<br/><br/>Biology and environmental science have been fundamentally reshaped by recent technological advances, including increased computational power, sensor technologies, publicly available software and data, and the Internet. Together with these advances, complex, multidisciplinary questions and urgent environmental and public health problems have led to changes in scientific culture and practice, with shifts toward greater collaboration, accountability, and transparency. These technological advances and cultural changes represent an educational challenge: already-full courses and curricula do not prepare students to address data-intensive problems. To assess the main opportunities and obstacles for integrating data science into biology and environmental science curricula, BEDE investigators will use a survey to gather data on faculty attitudes and expertise about it. Data from the survey will be examined at a BEDE workshop, where participants will: 1) develop Train-the-Teachers workshops based on curricular needs of survey respondents, 2) prepare a position/review paper describing barriers and opportunities to incorporating data science in biology and environmental science education; and 3) develop plans for further expansion of the Network. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) in the Directorate of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG). This REU Site will develop data science approaches to analyze and design complex biological systems. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the program, faculty mentors are drawn from multiple departments across life sciences, engineering, and computing sciences, including Chemical and Biological Engineering, Microbiology, Electrical and Computer engineering, and Computer Science. Research projects deal with the collection, analysis, and modeling of biological data sets to understand or design a system of interest, ranging from microbial communities to bioreactors. The research activities are supported through workshops providing a hands-on introduction to modern data analysis, modeling, and visualization tools. Students will be provided training in responsible conduct of research and ethics through seminars and group discussions led by faculty mentors. Participants will be recruited nationally among rising juniors and seniors majoring in an engineering or life science discipline. Applicants will be selected by a faculty committee of the PI and Co-PI, workshop leaders, and mentors. <br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The students will learn about different STEM learning styles of K-12 students, and be presented opportunities to engage in K-12 outreach.  <br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

The fellow, Nuri Theresa Pierce, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by C. Titus Brown at the University of California-Davis. The goals of this project are to improve RNA sequencing analysis while teaching workshops to increase accessibility into the field of bioinformatics. Marine microbial diversity remains difficult to study using classic ecological techniques, but is now feasible via next generation sequencing of seawater samples. With increased output of sequencing technologies, there is an urgent need for tools that achieve high accuracy while processing large amounts of data quickly using minimal processing power. This fellow is addressing this issue by developing improved methods for analyzing sequencing datasets while increasing the accessibility and utility of reference data. Access to these new databases and analysis techniques will allow biologists to use sequencing data to tackle larger problems and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the diversity and function of ocean communities. Beyond these scientific goals, the fellow is conducting data science training and outreach to expose a wide array of students to bioinformatics research, to help build a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive academe. The fellow is teaching basic coding, a skill that is critical in recruiting the next generation of marine biologists, for whom bioinformatics will be an essential tool.<br/><br/>This project leverages two computational techniques, de bruijn graphs and indexing via Sequence Bloom Trees and Minimum Hashing, to improve RNA-Seq analysis. Aim 1 of the project is to improve genome-wide RNA-Seq (transcriptome) analysis by developing the de bruijn graph, rather than the consensus transcriptome, as the reference for annotation and expression. Computational experiments with Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Transcriptome Sequencing Project data are being used to assess improvements. The fellow is also using the indexing techniques described above to create a reduced representation of existing reference data to facilitate rapid computational querying for sequence similarity (Aim 2) and expression similarity (Aim 3) with new data. Throughout the project, the fellow is receiving training in software development, project management, open science practices, and grant writing to improve her technical and academic skillsets. In addition, the fellow is training a diverse set of students in data intensive biology through development of teaching materials and a series of coding workshops."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Specifically, the Fellow will develop new methods to understand how species are related. This understanding is critical to many research areas. For example, to understand how disease-causing bacteria and viruses are spread, we need to know which outbreaks are similar. Biologists determine species' relationships by looking for similarities in DNA sequences. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have created lots of data to compare species; however, the relationships within certain groups of species are still debated. The Fellow will develop methods to filter large DNA datasets to include only subsets useful for understanding species' relationships. This process will remove data that may be misleading. This research will help scientists across the globe to piece together the Tree of Life. Because ""Big Data"" work requires that researchers have strong quantitative and computer skills, the Fellow will work with URI students and faculty to develop training strategies for underrepresented biology majors to work with biological ""Big Data"". Embracing inclusion and diversity at the undergraduate level is important to combat the lack of diversity at higher levels of research, which is critical to fostering diverse perspectives and opportunities for all.<br/><br/>The Fellow will address the problem of conflicting results in estimating species' relationships in three ways. (1) Starting with whole-genome datasets, the Fellow will apply novel filtering methods to remove loci that fail to resolve well-supported clades, as these loci likely carry non-historical signal. Specifically, the Fellow will analyze data simulated under biologically-relevant conditions, and sequence data from two clades that have been a focus of numerous incongruous phylogenomic studies: mammals and birds.  (2) The Fellow will test historically accepted notions regarding the informativeness of different genomic subsets (e.g. coding, non-coding, intergenic regions). (3) The Fellow will investigate how functional annotations of loci correlate with age-specific node resolution. To develop students' computational skills, the Fellow will lead workshops for existing groups of underrepresented biology students at URI. These workshops will include coding lessons that are accessible to novice students, and highlight career / internship opportunities in ""Big Data"" and biological data science. Students will engage with real biological data and problems, and participate in team-based exercises.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They rarely live or act alone and instead exist in complex communities composed of many interacting species that make up the microbiome.  This award supports the development of the next generation of Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced 'chime'), a free and open source software platform for analyzing microbiomes based on DNA sequencing data.  Microbiome science is in a transformation from being descriptive and technically challenging, to becoming hypothesis-driven, actionable, and technically straight-forward, in part enabled by QIIME.  We now know that the traditional approach for studying microbial communities, which relied on culturing microbes in the lab, is insufficient because we don't know the conditions required for the growth of most microbes.  Recent advances link microbiomes to functional processes via 'culture independent' techniques, such as sequencing fragments of microbial genomes, and then using those fragments as 'molecular fingerprints' to profile the microbiome.  The bottleneck in microbiome analysis is not DNA sequencing, but in interpreting the large quantities of sequence data generated.  QIIME 2 will advance knowledge of microbiomes by helping users derive insight through interactive exploratory analysis capabilities, understand the underlying methods, and report their results in ways accessible to end users from outside of the field, including physicians, engineers and policymakers who urgently need access to conclusions drawn from studies of complex microbial ecosystems.  Societal benefits range from global to personal (from understanding cycling of biologically essential nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen in the environment to curing disease, including obesity and cancer).  QIIME has been cited over 4,000 times and has active user and developer communities.  Educational workshops on QIIME are taught approximately monthly in the USA and around the world.<br/><br/>At its core, QIIME 2 will provide a stable application programming interface (API) relying on existing community standards for documentation, coding style, and testing. It will have a novel 'documentation-driven' graphical user interface that will make QIIME accessible to users without requiring advanced computational skills.  At the same time, it will help users improve their computational skills through exposure to the underlying bioinformatics methods. QIIME 2 will have fully integrated provenance tracking, which will simplify reporting and reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows.  A first-class plugin system will decentralize development by allowing outside developers to add new methods to the QIIME 2 platform. The API will also support improved integration of QIIME as a component of other widely used systems, such as Illumina BaseSpace® and Qiita, and an automatically generated command line interface will be provided for power users. QIIME 2 will have a completely redeveloped parallel framework, which will support deployment on diverse high-performance computing resources, from locally owned and operated computer clusters to commercially available cloud computing platforms.

They rarely live or act alone and instead exist in complex communities composed of many interacting species that make up the microbiome.  This award supports the development of the next generation of Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, pronounced ""chime""), a free and open source software platform for analyzing microbiomes based on DNA sequencing data.  Microbiome science is in a transformation from being descriptive and technically challenging, to becoming hypothesis-driven, actionable, and technically straight-forward, in part enabled by QIIME.  We now know that the traditional approach for studying microbial communities, which relied on culturing microbes in the lab, is insufficient because we don't know the conditions required for the growth of most microbes.  Recent advances link microbiomes to functional processes via 'culture independent' techniques, such as sequencing fragments of microbial genomes, and then using those fragments as 'molecular fingerprints' to profile the microbiome.  The bottleneck in microbiome analysis is not DNA sequencing, but in interpreting the large quantities of sequence data generated.  QIIME 2 will advance knowledge of microbiomes by helping users derive insight through interactive exploratory analysis capabilities, understand the underlying methods, and report their results in ways accessible to end users from outside of the field, including physicians, engineers and policymakers who urgently need access to conclusions drawn from studies of complex microbial ecosystems.  Societal benefits range from global to personal (from understanding cycling of biologically essential nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen in the environment to curing disease, including obesity and cancer).  QIIME has been cited over 4,000 times and has active user and developer communities.  Educational workshops on QIIME are taught approximately monthly in the USA and around the world.<br/><br/>At its core, QIIME 2 will provide a stable application programming interface (API) relying on existing community standards for documentation, coding style, and testing. It will have a novel 'documentation-driven' graphical user interface that will make QIIME accessible to users without requiring advanced computational skills.  At the same time, it will help users improve their computational skills through exposure to the underlying bioinformatics methods. QIIME 2 will have fully integrated provenance tracking, which will simplify reporting and the reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows.  A first-class plugin system will decentralize development by allowing outside developers to add new methods to the QIIME 2 platform. The API will also support improved integration of QIIME as a component of other widely used systems, such as Illumina BaseSpace® and Qiita, and an automatically generated command line interface will be provided for power users. QIIME 2 will have a completely redeveloped parallel framework, which will support deployment on diverse high-performance computing resources, from locally owned and operated computer clusters to commercially available cloud computing platforms.  All stages of QIIME 2 development will be driven by user community input through the QIIME Forum (currently over 2500 active users) and our public GitHub repository.

Skills from computer and data sciences have become core competencies for students even though many life science faculty completed formal training without the computational expertise needed to effectively engage in this field. The Genomics Education Alliance (GEA) will bring together members of existing genomics education networks, leveraging their combined expertise to identify and curate common genome analysis tools, associated curricular and assessment materials, and faculty training strategies to facilitate the adoption of genomics instruction at any college or university. By making existing resources accessible, the GEA will enable current faculty to guide undergraduate life science students participating in authentic genomic research projects. Such work will enhance the ability of students -- whether at 2- or 4-year institutions -- to become productive members of the technological work-force, to succeed in post-graduation studies in biology and related disciplines, and to be better informed citizens and decision makers. The GEA will develop a consensus set of vetted resources and training materials to be disseminated to the education community through a single web portal for use of these materials in undergraduate classrooms. Curation efforts will emphasize faculty training and student learning resources, in particular the development of strategies to effectively lead genomics Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs).<br/><br/>The GEA will form an extended network, recruiting members from existing undergraduate genomics education communities, and exploit their combined experience to create a unified and sustainable platform, available through a web portal, that faculty can use to engage diverse students in inquiry-based curricula and CUREs. Our efforts will focus around three major aims: 1) curation and maintenance of computational resources for genomics instruction; 2) development of faculty training and student learning materials; and 3) evaluation of teaching and learning assessments in genomics education, aligning assessments with faculty training and student learning resources. The GEA network will be organized into four committees -- Bioinformatics Infrastructure, Student Learning, Faculty Training, and Evaluation/Assessment -- who will meet regularly to assemble and select materials to be further refined at the three face-to-face workshops. The specific tasks of each committee will be set at the kickoff workshop, and their initial work will be reported at a second progress workshop. At the final synthesis workshop, participants will evaluate the products and recommend any continued development needed for broad implementation. Curated materials will be maintained on established infrastructure to ensure the long-term accessibility of these products.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One level of this organization consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, and is called the chromatin. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture methods (one example is called the Hi-C assay) have been developed, and yield an immense amount of information about 3D genome organization. However, most current analysis tools cannot distinguish the Hi-C, or equivalent, information that comes from the paired (homologous) maternal and paternal chromosomes in diploid organisms (like humans and other mammals). This means it is not possible to tell if there are different effects arising from the maternal and paternal copies of genes (the alleles). This project will address this problem and allow the development of fine-scale, allele-specific chromatin structures and therefore shed light on the role(s) of chromatin interactions in allelic gene regulation as well as larger principles of genome organization. This research will result in novel computational and statistical methods that combine the analysis of allele-specific chromatin structure with gene expression regulation; the products will include open-source software tools for 3D genome modeling, comparison, visualization, and exploration. These software tools will be made publicly accessible to scientists worldwide. The integrated research and educational activities include curriculum development for both undergraduate and graduate courses in subjects including data science, and statistical and computational genomics. Activities will allow undergraduate students to participate in the research project, as well as training graduate student researchers to acquire interdisciplinary expertise. The project will reach out particularly to middle school students with the goal of engaging young women and underrepresented minority groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to (i) establish a new computational and statistical framework for modeling the 3D chromatin structures in an allele-specific manner; (ii) identify structural differences between homologous chromosome pairs; (iii) investigate the impact of chromatin organization on allelic gene regulation; and (iv) understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene function. The project will integrate fine-scale allele-specific chromatin structures with the currently overwhelming amount of one-dimensional functional genomics data to discover new allele-specific regulatory elements and features. The project will elucidate gene regulation principles at an unprecedented resolution, and enhance our understanding of the interplay between genome architecture and gene expression. These findings will have fundamental significance in molecular cell biology, personal genomics, and medicine.

The volume and variety of data being generated, the increased accessibility of data for aggregation, the improved discoverability of data, and the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of scientific research are driving the need for new skill sets to address scientific issues of critical national and global importance. The biodiversity sciences have experienced a rapid mobilization of data that has increased capacity to investigate large-scale issues of critical importance in the 21st century (e.g., climate change and its impacts, zoonotic disease transmission, sustainable resource management, impacts of invasive species, and biodiversity loss). The volume, complexity, and variability in biodiversity data requires sophisticated data skills to ensure accurate and reproducible science. The RCN-UBE Biodiversity Literacy in Undergraduate Education - Data Initiative (BLUE Data) will bring together communities of biodiversity, data, and education specialists to identify core biodiversity data competencies for undergraduates, develop strategies for integrating these competencies into the introductory biology curriculum, and build capacity for sustained development and implementation of biodiversity and data literacy education. <br/><br/>The BLUE Data Network has four goals: 1) Cultivate a diverse and inclusive network of biodiversity researchers, data scientists, and biology educators focused on undergraduate data-centric biodiversity education, 2) Build community consensus on core biodiversity data literacy competencies, 3) Develop strategies and exemplar materials to guide the integration of biodiversity data literacy competencies into introductory undergraduate biology curricula, and 4) Extend the network to engage a broader community of undergraduate educators in biodiversity data literacy efforts. Beginning with targeted community assessment (e.g., focus groups, surveys, needs assessment), and followed by dedicated workshops and symposia, thematic working groups, sessions at society conferences, and online virtual networking, BLUE Data brings together an interdisciplinary community to translate emerging tools and resources for biodiversity data access and analysis to the core undergraduate biology curriculum. BLUE Data will work as a community to develop competencies, materials, and strategies to infuse biodiversity data into the curriculum and facilitate broad-scale adoption of transferrable data literacy competencies that can improve undergraduate biology training to meet increasing workforce demands in both data and biodiversity sciences. A more data literate workforce will result in a broader data-enabled community of researchers, educators and engineers prepared to address emerging issues, ask data-intensive questions, and promote data driven innovation. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/).

The collection's globally significant strengths are in aquatic insects, which are important bioindicators of the health of freshwater ecosystems, and black flies, which are significant vectors of human disease. As South Carolina's primary insect collection, this resource serves regional pest diagnostic needs, vouchers a wide variety of survey and monitoring projects, and underpins conservation planning for the region's arthropod diversity. With holdings of over one million specimens representing over 11,000 species, the collection is rich in historical biodiversity data. However, the collection's storage systems are aging, and many parts of the collection are in jeopardy of loss from museum pests and evaporation of preservative. This project will involve transfer of all specimens to modern cabinetry, drawers, and vials, ensuring its longevity, and will digitize locality and specimen images in the process. Several new positions will be created, including a collection manager, graduate assistant, and several part-time undergraduate assistants over the three years of the project. The improved collections and data captured will greatly expand the reach of our extension and outreach programs, improve regional pest monitoring efforts, and offer great opportunities for training of graduate and undergraduate students in entomology and biodiversity science.<br/><br/>Collection rehousing will follow renovation of two newly dedicated spaces adjacent to those currently occupied. Air-tight cabinetry will be employed throughout to eliminate dependence on fumigants for pest protection in the dry, pinned collection. In the alcohol-preserved collection, old vials with degraded stoppers will be replaced by secure screw-cap vials, and all vials will be moved into enclosed cabinetry to protect from light. As collection storage is upgraded, exemplars of each species in the collection will be imaged, and the associated data captured and transcribed with a combination of student and crowd-sourced assistance. Data will be ported to a relational, vouchered specimen database (Specify), and unique specimen identifiers will be applied to all specimens digitized. Data and images will be shared through the museum's web pages (https://sites.google.com/site/clemsonarthropodcollection/), as well as through such aggregators as iDigBio (http://www.idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Outreach activities will include biodiversity events at Clemson's main campus and satellite facilities, participation in citizen science data gathering efforts, and expansion of our program of in-house tours."

The network will have three main activities: (1) interdisciplinary workshops that bring together practitioners, academics, agency managers and students; (2) student internships that provide introductory research experience for students using citizen science data and spatial and temporal datasets; and (3) collaborative assessments of student learning experiences. The network will focus on citizen science data collected for biodiversity questions--specifically species identification, species occurrence, and habitat parameters. The bioblitz activities, large public events focused on a 24 hour survey of biological diversity, are tools that engage citizens in science using inventories, smartphone apps, and other approaches. The addition of science parameters to the citizen science tool coupled with team learning activities engages students in both science and discovery. While an increasing number of studies focus on helping students decipher science, most assessment tools only indirectly measure student engagement and leadership in the sciences. The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses the growing use of citizen science tools in the field and explores the potential for citizen science activities as new innovative approaches to engage underrepresented minority students in STEM especially using activities outside of the classroom and in the context of local communities. It is envisaged that these assessments will have both summative and formative applications to broadening participation in the environmental sciences.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include the faculty who come from a variety of biology and social science sub-disciplines at different career levels and from a wide range of institutions. In addition, the participating students come from many different types of institutions including community colleges, minority serving institutions and undergraduate institutions.  Both faculty and students reflect the growing diversity of the United States. Underrepresented minorities and especially students interested in connections to communities are selected as a part of a team that participates in the bioblitzes.  Students act as both research assistants and citizen sciences during the bioblitz so they both learn the science and grow into leadership. As a key outcome, the common standards and assessments will be used across multiple institutions and disciplines of biology to determine how discovery experiences using citizen science and informal settings outside the classroom can engage students in STEM fields.<br/><br/> This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

RFID allows for short-range wireless communication between small transponder tags and readers, and it can facilitate tracking of individual items or animals that are equipped with a tag. RFID is a mature and ubiquitous technology, familiar to people in the form of ""microchip"" tags implanted in cats and dogs. A community of researchers has emerged that employs RFID to track individual birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and even insects in a wide range of field and laboratory research endeavors. For the majority of these projects, data collection, analysis, and curation are currently done by hand, which requires individual investigators to spend considerable time on data management rather than science. ETAG will transform the practices of its user community, by creating a common infrastructure based on open-source tools that will allow scientists to collect, validate, visualize, analyze, and share data and metadata in near real-time. As a result, researchers will have new capacities both for producing novel science and for sharing their work with their peers and the general public. The capacity to follow the activities of individual animals at feeding stations and nests is a powerful gateway to conversations about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). ETAG will provide new avenues for researchers to showcase their work and share it with the public through websites and social networking, featuring real-time updates from activities in the field. <br/><br/>The purpose of the ETAG project is to generate informatics infrastructure for RFID-based research, and to equip the emerging user community with resources that let them get the most from their data both in terms of generating new science and performing public outreach and education. ETAG will serve as a data upload portal, a professionally curated database, and a multifaceted dissemination portal for RFID data and will also facilitate the exchange of technical information about hardware, experimental approaches, protocols, and data analysis software produced by the user community. ETAG is part of a broader initiative that will make low-cost, highly versatile RFID equipment available to the scientific community. Already, more than 50 research groups in 19 countries have employed RFID systems designed by the ETAG team to carry out data collection in field and lab settings. Improved hardware and software resources will spur even wider adoption of RFID technologies by biologists and educators. With system support for real time data exchange, ETAG will allow these users to monitor their field or lab studies remotely and respond rapidly to emerging developments or problems. In addition, a common set of Internet-based tools will make it possible for teams of biologists and/or citizen scientists to undertake studies at a continental scale with concomitant data collection at networks of field sites. Finally, the software design documents and code will all be open source, allowing scientists to form alliances with a range of engineers, web designers, and IT specialists who will help add to and maintain the ETAG infrastructure.

The National Science Foundation Theory Team at Columbia University will unite exceptional resources in statistical data analysis and theoretical modeling with an extensive network of experimental collaborators to address the enormous challenges facing neuroscience. Never has the need been greater for theoretical insights and sophisticated data analysis. The field of neuroscience is facing a torrent of complex data from a system that is, itself, extraordinarily complex. Future progress requires developing the ability to extract knowledge and understanding from these data through analyses and modeling that capture the essence of what they mean. The goal of the NeuroNex Theory Team at Columbia is to establish, through the quality of its research, the excellence of its trainees, and the impact of its visitor, dissemination, and outreach programs, a new cooperative paradigm that will move neuroscience to unprecedented levels of discovery and understanding.<br/><br/>High-density electrode recording, wide-field calcium imaging and complex connectivity mapping are bringing neuroscience into an era of extensive multi-area and even whole-brain studies of neural activity and circuitry. The neuroscience community desperately needs new ways of interpreting data obtained from different species using myriad techniques and for thinking about neural processing over large length and time scales and across multiple brain areas. In response to these challenges, two major goals will drive and define research at the NeuroNex Theory Team at Columbia: first, integrating the analysis methods and theoretical models used to infer meaning from data with each other and with the experiments that generate these data; and second, providing analytic tools and theoretical frameworks to understand interactions between multiple brain regions and to draw important overarching lessons from experiments exploiting a variety of techniques across different species. Progress will be made through a tight integration of theoretical techniques with outstanding experimental collaborators working on a variety of systems and species. Graduate and postdoctoral training will stress technical excellence and broad perspectives in both theoretical and experimental neuroscience. Outreach will be made to other researchers through visitor and exchange programs, sponsored meetings and dissemination of research results and high-quality, user-friendly software. Outreach will be made to the broader community by sharing the excitement of neuroscience research with elementary and high school students and with the general public.

Gregory (University of Pennsylvania)<br/><br/>Co-PIs:  Eric Lyons and Mark Beilstein (University of Arizona)<br/> <br/>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of molecules gaining attention for their roles in various biological processes. lncRNAs are defined by the fact that they do not code for proteins and are therefore not mRNAs. In addition, they do not fit into other well-defined small silencing RNA-producing categories such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite the importance of lncRNAs in development, epigenetic modification, and stress responses, there is still much to be learned about their structure, protein interactions, and functions, especially in model and crop plant species. This project will address this significant gap using a combination of genomic, evolutionary, and bioinformatics approaches. It is anticipated that the data, web-accessible genome analytical tools, and data management systems developed by the project will provide novel insights into plant gene expression regulation by lncRNAs, and provide important new findings and resources for studies focused on the improvement of numerous crop and genetic model plants. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide interdisciplinary research training in RNA biology, computational science and evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral associates.  In addition, the project will develop an interdisciplinary course entitled ""Applied Concepts in RNA Biology"" that will leverage large-scale computing and datasets to understand various aspects of the role of RNA in biological systems.  This project-based course will teach the fundamentals of RNA biology, next-generation sequencing techniques, distributed and high performance computing, data-intensive science, and collaborative research techniques that will be used in student-driven research projects. The course will be taught simultaneously at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona, with two-way audio/video conferencing and lecture topics alternatively taught at each site. All project outcomes will be made readily accessible to the broader research community through a project website (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/EPIC-CoGe_Tutorial), the iPlant Collaborative and long-term repositories such as GenBank and the Short Read Archive (SRA). <br/> <br/>This project is uniquely positioned to provide insights into the structure and function of lncRNAs, and their interaction with specific epigenomic regulatory modifications in the genome. The specific goals of the project are to define a subset of lncRNAs that are important for proper gene regulation in both normal development and stress response.  Specifically, the project will focus on identifying and functionally characterizing those lncRNAs that are (1) nuclear, (2) highly structured, (3) stress responsive, (4) protein bound, and (5) evolutionary conserved in genetic models (Eutrema salsugineum and Arabidopsis thaliana) and in crop species (Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), focusing on their roles in stress adaptation. Finally, the project will expand EPIC-CoGe, a central repository for plant epigenomics data across all species, with advanced data integration, visualization, and analysis tools to allow for the integration of functional genomics data to provide new insight into genome-wide epigenomic interactions."

Archbold owns and manages a globally significant scrub preserve including the beautiful 90-acre, Lake Annie. Studies of Lake Annie are recognized globally for providing insights into the history of lakes in the southern USA (40,000-year sediment record), long-term (30-year) ecological and chemical sampling, and a moored buoy (since 2008) with sensors measuring chemical and physical conditions at the lake surface. This NSF award will support deployment of a new ""next-generation profiling buoy"" equipped with many more sensors (climate, oxygen, pH, algae and chlorophyll, temperature, water color, light, heat, solar radiation, and CO2) than Archbold's old buoy. Most of the new sensors will be ""profiling"", or constantly moving up and down, gathering data from the lake surface to the bottom of the lake at 67'. For deep lakes, like Lake Annie, continuous data from top to bottom are critical to measure features such as the ""metabolism"" of the whole lake, or how much energy (growth) is occurring (such as plant or algae production) versus energy loss such as via respiration.  Lake scientists, especially those engaged with the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network or GLEON, plan to combine Lake Annie data with data from other lakes around the world, allowing them to answer questions such as how lakes of different sizes, latitude, and surrounding land use are responding differently to changing conditions. The new Lake Annie buoy will provide research and education opportunities for visiting scientists and college classes, training for graduate students and interns, online data and remote data access, as well as a new module for Archbold's K-12 program, and expanded offerings for public programs including citizen science, lake association groups, science-arts events, and public seminars. A new interpretive sign will be installed at Lake Annie as well as increased sharing of lake science via a new video, Archbold social media, and enewsletters, <br/><br/><br/>This award will deploy a next generation, highly-instrumented profiling buoy at Lake Annie, a significant upgrade from the existing old buoy. The extensive (2 million record) Lake Annie buoy dataset is already available online via CUAHSI and this award will further expand Archbold's ability to deliver data for collaborations in lake science, especially with the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network GLEON. Lake scientists around the world plan to conduct analysis, synthesis, and modeling using Lake Annie data. Two new sondes and associated sensors will allow for continuous profiling of D.O., pH, total algae and chlorophyll, temperature, conductivity, fDOM, and light, as well as surface measures of meteorology, heat fluxes, solar radiation, and CO2. The new instrumentation will expand Archbold's role in cross-lake studies in areas such as: (i) lake metabolism by adding new measures of CO2 and D.O profiles; (ii) controls of high frequency variance in algal production and colored organic material by adding depth-resolved fluorescence sensors in a low-chlorophyll, oligotrophic humic end-member lake; (iii) spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity in controlling our highly spatiotemporally variable phytoplankton dynamics, a feature of subtropical lakes; and (iv) climate and physical modeling through new measurements of mixing, heat flux, and solar radiation. The new buoy will also allow more flexible maintenance, enhance access to real-time data, and expand Archbold's role linking field stations with lake research networks such as GLEON and NEON.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second is the expansion of an annual conference, currently focused on protein modeling and design, to include a student development and engagement track. Third is the development of an online presence allowing the D2D-CURE participants to work in concert on cutting-edge scientific problems as a community as opposed to isolated institutions and programs. Despite widespread adoption of computational protein design, significant improvements are still needed to move efforts from being a tool used to enrich proteins with the desired function into a more accurate and predictive computer-aided design tool with a quantitative relationship between design and desired function. We plan to focus on enzymes since the only large data sets that currently exist are not quantitative, have a low dynamic range, and often convolve several independent physical measurements into a single value. To generate the data sets needed to develop a new generation of computational protein design software for enzymes, we are proposing a Research Coordination Network to engage students and their instructors in using industrially relevant techniques while generating acutely needed protein structure-function datasets.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genomics has qualitatively improved our ability to investigate biological dynamics and to make important discoveries that are the foundations for understanding topics such as environmental change, developing and protecting crops, and improving health outcomes. Genome analysis, however, is a significant challenge for the practicing biologist.  Most biologists who need to undertake genome science are not sufficiently expert in the relevant analytical tools, or understand the complex workflows required to get from the initial data generated by sequencers to a biologically meaningful analyzed result. In addition, few have access to the supercomputing resources and large-scale storage required for processing and managing genomics data.  The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) addresses these challenges by providing an integrated service comprised of expert consulting and educational services, hardened and optimized software available through easy to use web-based workflow management tools, large memory supercomputers, and large scale data storage and publishing facilities.  These resources are particularly useful for researchers from smaller, and minority serving, institutions that typically do not have access to the required expertise and cyberinfrastructure, yet whose investigations are equally important. Since its inception in 2011, the NCGAS has supported over 80 research projects representing over $61M in funded research.  It engaged in 51 training events that served 691 individuals, of which 241 were from traditionally underserved populations.<br/><br/>The NCGAS (http://ncgas.org) was established in 2011 through a National Science Foundation ABI development award to help the national research community complete genomics research that requires data management and computational infrastructures at scale.  NCGAS is a partnership among the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center. It meets the technology challenges of modern genome science by providing excellent bioinformatics consulting services for genome analysis, particularly genome and transcriptome assembly, including research design, data analysis and visualization.

For example, species such as pig, sheep, chicken and dog are used to model human biology, leading to discoveries with implications in human health and well-being. Understanding the genetic basis of disease leads to improved health and welfare of companion animals. Farm animal research leads to improvement of traits related to animal health and production, ultimately enhancing global food sustainability. To accelerate scientific discovery in animal genetics, an international consortium called ""FAANG"" (Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes) aims to generate comprehensive maps of functional elements in genomes of domesticated animals. Data generated by FAANG will enhance the use of animal models in the biological and biomedical sciences. It will hasten discoveries in fundamental biology, as well as those that impact human health, animal well-being and agricultural production. In order for the FAANG effort to have substantial impacts on science and society, the data must be accessible to scientists and students of diverse disciplines. Effective use of the FAANG data will require data mining tools that enable easy search and retrieval, along with a workforce trained in areas such as bioinformatics and cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This project addresses the need for a high performance data mining resource that enables fine-grained querying and integrating the heterogeneous FAANG data with existing information, such as functions of known genes and research datasets. The specific aims of the project are to 1) develop FAANGMine - a high-performance data mining system that integrates genome assemblies and currently available annotation data for FAANG species, 2) extend FAANGMine by integrating new data generated by the FAANG Consortium, 3) create a FAANGMine user community that consists of students and scientists working on genetics of domesticated animal species. FAANGMine will empower animal researchers, with or without programming skills, to leverage the FAANG data in their research, thereby accelerating discoveries that elucidate the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. With the goal of fostering a FAANGMine user community, the proposed project will train over 30 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows through workshops and trainee visits with the FAANGMine developers. Moreover, undergraduate researchers will contribute to FAANGMine by developing demonstration projects. All trainees will have opportunities to work with data generated from cutting edge ""omics"" technologies, raising interest in STEM career pathways.

The project has laid a strong foundation to build an increasingly more capable CI and is poised to have an even greater impact on the plant sciences and a number of related fields, with a new focus on addressing computational bottlenecks for a broad number of life science researchers.   <br/><br/>In the next five years, iPlant will continue to enhance the capabilities of a comprehensive CI and will also expand the scope to cover a number of new fields of inquiry. In iPlant's initial phase, Grand Challenge projects were defined to shape community requirements for the design of the CI. The two projects, Genotype-to-Phenotype and the Tree of Life, led to new analytical tools and competences for genomics and evolutionary biology. Future work will advance these capabilities and expand into capture and modeling of phenotypic, environmental, and ecological data. As before, this growth will be motivated by community needs and accomplished by community collaboration.   <br/><br/>iPlant will continue to actively partner with other large CI development efforts and will coordinate CI development where feasible, appropriate, and mutually beneficial. iPlant will continue to be the underlying infrastructure provider for a number of projects that provide a variety of bioinformatics services. While continuing to support plant biology discovery research, iPlant will expand scope beyond the plant sciences, in coordination with nascent animal-centered efforts. The project will continue to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the life sciences community and the rapidly changing technological landscape faced by researchers.   <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is in advancing the state of modern biology. Without question, research progress in the plant sciences, and in life sciences more generally, is increasingly limited by data and computational challenges. As knowledge of plant biology increases, the field will progress from informatics-based discovery to predictive modeling and eventually to synthetic biology. A comprehensive CI that eliminates the bottlenecks of data management, data standards, file formats, analysis, efficient collaboration, and knowledge dissemination will be a necessary underlying enabler to achieve this vision, and iPlant is positioned to be this enabling infrastructure.   <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are numerous. The CI currently supports thousands of  end users through its data storage, cloud, and online analytical capabilities. As a service provider, iPlant underlies a number of other online biological information resources. The project will continue its wide-ranging and successful education and outreach efforts, and will teach computational skills to learners at all levels, with particular focus on faculty to enable a sustained culture change that incorporates these advanced skills into the teaching of biology."

This regulation is especially critical under unpredictable fluctuations in the natural environment, which could damage the balance between light input and the capacity of assimilatory reaction to process it. New plant photosynthesis phenotyping platforms have been developed in Dr. David Kramer (co-PI)'s lab, allowing one to determine how the photosynthetic machinery is integrated into cells and is delicately balanced to provide the right amount of energy, at the right times, in the correct forms without damaging the plant. The current major step is to extract useful information from massive plant phenotyping (performance) data to generate testable hypotheses and discover unknown plant energy-related genes and processes. Specifically, the objective is to develop new software approaches for processing, modeling and visualizing sophisticated and overwhelming amount of phenomics data in plant science to forms that are interpretable computers (to classify plants into genetic and performance categories) and by humans (through advanced visualization), leading to new insights on how plants function and new targets for plant improvement. <br/><br/>Large-scale phenotyping (phenomics) promises to bridge the gap between genomics, gene functions and traits. Specifically, to meet our growing needs for food and fuel, new bio-imaging approaches were developed to allow high-throughput, detailed plant phenotyping, with a focus on improving the efficiency of photosynthesis. Dr. Jin Chen (PI) and Dr. David Kramer (co-PI) aim to identify genes and processes that control photosynthesis efficiency in response to fluctuating environmental conditions, which are critical for understanding and improving plant energy storage and improving crop productivity. To achieve this, the research team must resolve a wide range of interacting factors that respond to environmental factors over very wide dynamic ranges of frequency, duration and intensity of conditions. Recently, the Dynamic Environmental Phenotype Imager (DEPI), a novel platform for monitoring responses of plant phenotypes under dynamic conditions has been developed in Dr. David Kramer (co-PI)'s lab. Initial data from DEPI reveals previously unseen effects attributable to genes formerly thought to have no known function.  While these developments on plant phenotyping are exciting, researchers are limited by the tools to analyze fully the phenomics data. Removing that limitation is the proposed goal of this project.  Dr. Jin Chen (PI) and Dr. David Kramer (co-PI)  will discover, develop, and apply Plant Phenomics Data Analytics (PPDA) solutions, such that massive phenomics data is transformed into knowledge or testable hypotheses to identify important genes to improve photosynthesis efficiency under dynamic environmental conditions. PPDA will ensure high data quality, identify and visualize important genes from complex plant phenomics data, and will advance knowledge discovery in the broader community. The project is comprised of four components: Aim 1. Develop, test and apply phenomics data quality control program to identify abnormal data and distinguish whether they arise from noise, artifacts or more interesting cases of altered biological responses. Aim 2. Develop, test and apply phenomics pattern discovery algorithms to identify important energy-related genes from photosynthesis phenomics data. The research team will develop dynamic phenotype network construction and phenotype module discovery algorithms to turn sophisticated phenomics data to testable hypotheses, to discover unknown genes, and to connect biological processes. Aim 3. Develop a data visualization package for complex phenomics data display using integrative multi-dimensional visualization methods, in order to facilitate scientific discovery on energy-related genes in response to changing environmental conditions. Aim 4. Provide proof of utility by applying PPDA to rationale for testing the G protein activation state regulation on photosynthesis efficiency. The researchers will phenotype Arabidopsis thaliana a large informative set of G protein mutants under changing environmental conditions. Then they will apply PPDA to identify genes with emergent functions under subsets of the dynamic environmental conditions. They will resolve the role of G signaling in fluctuation detection.

A species' geographic range is the map of where a species can be found. It is fundamental to understanding species' ecology and evolution and increasingly plays a vital role in conservation. Collections of species ranges covering most of the 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species are already available for scientific analysis. However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. <br/><br/>The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time. This research will make substantial contributions to scientific infrastructure through the development of a scientific codebase for the production of high-quality species ranges from primary biodiversity data.

Importantly, the distributed nature of data generation in biology makes this situation even more challenging. Today one can hardly find a research institution or university without multiple high-throughput DNA sequencing machines, and there are often references to a ""data crisis"" in biology. Federal agencies, and the NSF in particular, are investing heavily in cyberinfrastructure by supporting development of high performance computing (HPC) resources such as the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Yet to a large extent, these resources remain unknown to biological researchers who overwhelmingly continue to rely on fragile in-house computation. The goal of this project is to ensure effective utilization of federal funds that have been invested into development of the national computing infrastructure. This project will extend the Galaxy software platform to leverage existing NSF hardware resources, increasing the value of existing infrastructure for biology researchers that were previously unable to take full advantage of these resources.<br/><br/>This project will follow a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of experimental scientists, tool developers, and administrators of high performance compute systems (HPC). Access to national compute infrastructure will be expanded so that Galaxy will function as a middleware interface to existing heterogeneous environments such as XSEDE or individual systems such as Jetstream. Software components necessary to optimize Galaxy as a link between researchers and existing HPC will be developed based on pilot projects with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), XSEDE, PSC, and Indiana University. (2) XSEDE resources to enable interactive data exploration and visualization will be leveraged to expand Galaxy's current capacity for dynamic scientific data analysis.  Integration with Interactive Analysis Environments, such as Jupyter or RStudio will allow manipulation and creation of Galaxy datasets using common scripting languages. Taking advantage of XSEDE resources will enable Galaxy's interactive environments and visual analytics to scale to large datasets and sophisticated workflows. (3) Sustainable training and outreach will focus on creating and disseminating curricula that enable investigators to learn skills needed to analyze large datasets. Creation of pre-configured infrastructure components for running workshops and develop modules for undergraduate and graduate face-to-face and on-line classes will expand the current educational portfolio to scale support for increasing numbers of Galaxy users, including disciplines beyond life sciences such as Natural Language Processing.

However, collections of species ranges from the other ~95% of species on the planet are rare. The time is ripe to change this. New access to vast quantities of data from biological inventories, museums, citizen science, and previously funded studies mean that adequate data are available to estimate the ranges of many more species. However, we are currently missing robust forecasting methods and the computational tools to produce large numbers of ranges. This project will develop the novel computational methods and algorithms needed to forecast the current state and future fate of the many thousands of poorly studied species ranges. These methods will be applied to forecast how 100,000+ plant species in the New World will respond to climate change. The researchers will test key assumptions in conservation biology about how species respond to changing climate and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots across North and South America have/will change over time.  The end result of their work will be a novel tool for the ecological community that has tremendous potential to guide biological sampling strategies, particularly in conservation and citizen science applications. <br/><br/>The proposed research will examine whether biodiversity hotspots are constant through time and whether species climatic niches are phylogenetically conserved, two implicit assumptions with wide-reaching implications in conservation biology and basic ecology. This research will develop a workflow to predict species ranges for any taxonomic group using by combining occurrence data with GIS data. This workflow will be applied to all New World plants to study basic questions, such as how species richness varies across space and time (a topic studied almost exclusively in vertebrates and trees). Computationally, the project will address core challenges in data scrubbing, niche modeling practices, novel niche modeling methods, and mega-phylogeny analysis methods.  A freely available generic pipeline will be capable of linking biodiversity occurrence data to species ranges and scaling these computations to 1000s or 100,000s of species. This integrated pipeline will be implemented by: 1) appropriately scrubbing data to remove taxonomic and geographic errors, 2) identifying clear best practice methods for range modeling applicable across diverse species, 3) innovating range modeling methods that integrate diverse data such as presence only museum collections and abundance-based plot data 4) scaling computationally-intensive range modeling in an HPC environment, and 5) placing the outputs of the products in a phylogenetic context. This project will develop such a pipeline using a novel database of 20,000,000 observations of 100,000+ species of plants in the New World. The range forecasts produced will be used to test key assumptions in conservation biology about the phylogenetic conservatism of species climatic niches and the geographic constancy of diversity hotspots over time.

The bold, innovative approaches needed to manage the ocean's resources wisely are increasingly data driven, with marine researchers now generating and analyzing vast datasets. The OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC - http://hmsc.oregonstate.edu) brings 50 years of collaborative marine research to bear on these critical issues, with innovative ideas but aged facilities not designed for the Big Data needs of the present and future. This HMSC communication cyberinfrastructure modernization project will improve the fiber network connections between all federal, state and university buildings on the HMSC campus to remove barriers to collaboration and Big Data transfer at HMSC, and complement upcoming investments by Oregon State University (OSU). Training the next generation of leaders who can utilize these data intensive tools to bridge the social and natural sciences in designing multi-pronged, 21st century solutions is imperative to a sustainable future for our nation. As a land grant/sea grant university, OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center excels in research and training, as well as public education and outreach for youth, families, and adults. The Visitor Center hosts >150,000 visitors and 40,000 students from K-12 classes annually, and through extensive partnerships including with the Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence, Pacific Partnerships (COSEE) and the Oregon Coast STEM Hub (K-12), is uniquely positioned to rapidly communicate research findings to visitors and stakeholders.<br/><br/>This project will replace an aging and minor fiber infrastructure built for the pre-ethernet days with a fiber installation designed to allow an immediate 20X increase in bandwidth ? but also allowing for virtually unlimited scaling increases for the future. This new cyberinfrastructure will be capable of fully supporting current, as well as future science and education needs through expandability. The project will first build a conduit network between HMSC buildings to replace an ageing direct buried fiber infrastructure. This will be done with a modern backbone vault and conduit design to permit future improvements without significant reinvestment. Then, bundles of single mode fibers will be deployed through the vaults and conduits to each building. Finally, modern switching equipment will be implemented to realize the full potential of this new fiber, making it possible to provision and aggregate high speed connections to individual ports in HMSC buildings. In addition, this equipment will support MPLS and fully integrate HMSC into the MPLS-based architecture of OSU?s new core network including the research network OSU has built through an NSF CC-NIE grant. These improvements will enable full utilization of an OSU-funded dark fiber network path planned between HMSC and the main OSU campus 50 miles away, which will allow virtually unlimited bandwidth growth on demand to HMSC. They will also enable full integration of HMSC with the core network on OSU?s Corvallis campus, including the 40 Gb/s research network built through an NSF CC-NIE (Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Network Infrastructure and Engineering) grant. This project will be the final piece enabling all components of this modern cyberinfrastructure for HMSC to become fully operational and integrated at the maximal capacity needed for current and future Big Data needs.<br/>"

The specimens in these collections are associated with data of interest to researchers, resource managers, educators, and the general public, such as when and where each specimen was found.  Most specimens are irreplaceable because they represent a population or species at a time and place in the past.  The North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM) recently acquired three significant natural history collections of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles that date back to the early 1800's. The NCSM will assimilate these collections to ensure their long-term preservation, and will curate, catalog, verify species identifications, and digitize the specimens to improve their research value and accessibility. Through a custom-built web app, members of the public (citizen scientists) will participate in entering data into the collection database at NCSM, which helps develop public awareness and appreciation for the value and importance of natural history collections. <br/><br/>The three-year project will incorporate the newly acquired collections from the Charleston Museum, Appalachian State University, and the S.W. Ross deep-sea expeditions (University of North Carolina - Wilmington) into the holdings of the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM). Due to the precarious curatorial status and lack of accessible associated data for these three collections, there is an urgent need to secure their future and provide for their full utility. Over 57,000 lots will be curated and digitized, making them research ready and web accessible.  Citizen scientists will be recruited to use a web application with validation mechanisms that provide the transcriber with real time feedback.  This accelerates the goal of incorporating specimen data into the NCSM collection databases and making the collections globally accessible.  All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.

The central hypothesis motivating this instrument investment is that the risk of extinction of organisms due to climate change arises from: a) the direct effects of climate, acting via evolved physiological adaptations that exacerbate extinction risk, and b) the cascading effects of climate change impacts on plant diversity and habitats. These data, together with research that uses them, will allow us to forecast future climate impacts on biotic systems, and to eventually assess historical impacts of climate in and around each of the field stations. The Institute for the Study of the Ecological and Evolutionary Climate Impacts (ISEECI) organizes diverse scientists across the UC System and are integrating these studies with the scientists using Northern Arizona University's Southwest Experimental Garden Array (SEGA). This array of ecophysiological plant and animal sensors will ensure cross-site consistency and comparability at a sufficiently large spatial scale to address regional impacts of climate on coastal, central valley, montane and desert ecosystems of the Southwest. <br/><br/>This new sensor network will instrument 12 sites in the California and 8 sites in Northern Arizona with data loggers and sensors designed to measure environmental parameters relevant to a wide range of animal and plant species. Selected conifers and coastal redwoods will be monitored for sap flow and soil temperature and moisture, and more open grassland/forb and shrub communities with soil temperature and moisture sensors as well as surface temperature at biologically salient heights to complement the existing system of upgraded weather stations already present at NRS and SEGA sites. Temperature sensors will collect similar data on environmental temperatures of endothermic and ectothermic animal taxa, and install phenocams to record phenological changes in trees driven by climate change. The system can be upgraded with new sensors, is expandable with respect to the kinds of data we gather and biotic systems we can instrument, and will be very adaptable for future research. The instruments will capture salient measurements of temperature and drought impacts on terrestrial systems that will allow a unified analysis of ecosystem functioning in the face of changing climate, adding scientific value to each individual field station with a more in-depth biotic record of historical change, and also across the system of field stations enhancing collaboration across the west coast and southwest region of the US. Sensor data will be available immediately online to all ISEECI and SEGA scientists groups, and once fully operational to other researchers. Integration with education and public outreach will give hundreds of students critical messages about climate change and using science to help mitigate its impacts. NAU and the UC system provide graduate and undergraduate students with many experiential learning opportunities in environmental sciences, and detailed, long-term data will supplement and contextualize classwork and research projects. UC and NAU actively work to enhance student diversity: NAU has particular expertise in reaching Native American students, while the Hispanic representation at universities in both states is increasing and being actively incorporated into campus programs and labs."

The National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) facilitates novel research across the natural and social sciences to achieve this understanding and to provide the knowledge needed to address complex problems challenging human societies globally. The Center will develop education and training activities to build capacity across all career stages to solve complex problems and to develop a new generation of researchers skilled in collaboration and communication. These activities will emphasize the relevance of socio-environmental synthesis to real world problems by including policy-makers, governmental agencies, and non-governmental agencies in all activities, ensuring that these knowledge users obtain the information they need to make sound decisions. New investments will train thought leaders, educators, and decision-makers of the future. Building capacity extends to increased involvement of under-served groups in solving societal problems. Partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, coupled with active mentoring of their undergraduates and faculty, will engage these communities in environmental challenges that have significant cultural, economic, and social implications. Center activities will build computational literacy and provide publicly-available analytical tools that will advance computational training far beyond SESYNC's participants. Through a suite of new activities, SESYNC will build capacity to find solutions to pressing societal challenges. <br/><br/>SESYNC has established itself as a pioneer in the integrative, computationally intensive, and trans-disciplinary research that defines a new biology for the 21st century. Its approach for the future relies on a firmly vetted and established approach to synthesis developed over 5 years of experiment and testing. Activities focus on developing a community of practice for socio-environmental synthesis. New partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities will establish workshops, collaborative synthesis projects, and a peer faculty-student network to foster exchange of ideas, provide intellectual and moral support, and facilitate access to professional development and research opportunities. A new postdoctoral program focuses on 'immersion' to accelerate development of integrated, inter-disciplinary research projects. Fellows will first initiate a project in their own discipline and then be quickly immersed, through lectures and workshops, in the theory and practice of related disciplines. Graduate students will direct their own synthesis working groups to develop skills in collaboration and communication early in their careers. Diverse efforts to track participants will sustain their involvement in socio-environmental synthesis after leaving SESYNC. A new cyberinfrastructure program, Data to Motivate Synthesis, will use facilitated data discovery and team science workshops to formulate research questions at the interface of social-natural sciences. A new collaboration with Georgetown University's Environmental Initiative will strengthen SESYNC's 'actionable' scholarship portfolio and further broaden participation in socio-environmental synthesis. The two institutions will co-support four postdoctoral fellows to conduct synthesis research on science-policy links. The success of all activities will be measured against established goals and milestones through formative and summative assessment.<br/>"

The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles.

The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics.

Exploring real scientific data helps students develop quantitative skills and understand the real-world context for core biological concepts. These methods provide high-impact learning experiences in undergraduate STEM education, which can increase retention and academic achievement for all students, including those from underrepresented and underserved groups.  A great deal of progress has been made in the collection, sharing, and discoverability of biological research data as a public resource. However, limitations in sharing and adapting these resources to formats for teaching remains a barrier to wide dissemination and adoption in the classroom. The development and publication of these resources represent the first step in the open educational resources (OER) life cycle, where instructors then find, implement, and enrich these resources based on the context of their classrooms. This network will identify causes and mechanisms to overcome the gap in the curriculum cycle after the development stage by designing a community framework for the large-scale sharing and adaptation of data-centric collections. There is an emerging need to address this gap given the rapid increase and availability of diverse research and monitoring datasets. Increasing the availability of data-centric resources will also promote critical thinking, communication, and quantitative skills, which are key skills for classroom success, for the STEM workforce, and for science literacy in an informed citizenry.<br/> <br/>The network will be composed of experts in information science and the OER model, experienced educational resource developers, leaders in faculty development, diversity, and inclusion efforts, and undergraduate instructors with interests in applying teaching approaches with data in the classroom. These diverse stakeholders will collaborate to build a working model for sustaining a technological and social community focused on emerging approaches and resources for biology data-centric teaching.  Through a workshop and a series of online meetings this network will (1) define the needs and challenges of different stakeholders associated with data-centric pedagogy, (2) explore social-technological solutions in order to create a vision of a virtual space that would promote the OER model, and to identify necessary incentives for sustained investment by faculty and module providers in the virtual space, and (3) conceptually synthesize discussions into a report which will serve as the framework for an expanding and evolving network. The goal of this network is to further elucidate barriers and generate mechanisms to overcome these barriers to wide-dissemination of high-impact data-centric teaching pedagogies in biology.  <br/> <br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

BML is located in a remote region of the Northern California coast, despite the remote location, BML has access to available bandwidth up to 10 GB/s through AT&T's fiber service, comparable to bandwidth offerings in major metropolitan areas but the aged, internal local area network infrastructure (developed when the WAN bandwidth was 1.5Mbps) is a severe limitation. BML's fiber internet connection is currently analogous to a ""new superhighway"", however BML's internal connection to the outside (WAN) is analogous to a ""bumpy gravel road"" slowing down the advantage that the external high speed infrastructure can provide. The new high performance internal architecture is designed to support research, instruction, public education, and data acquisition/dissemination; both across the facility and beyond. BML is situated in a scientifically relevant location. It is the primary open-coast research facility for research in upwelling environments along the California coast. Sophisticated technical resources include ample bandwidth (external internet access), network storage, video conferencing capability, access to long-term atmospheric, oceanographic, and biological data, BML- and agency-operated sensor networks, an ocean-observing node, University library resources, seawater system, pathogen containment facilities, climate change research facilities, access to the 362-acre Bodega Marine Reserve, and specialized laboratory instruments and microscopy.<br/><br/>Enhanced network capacity provides both UC Davis researchers, visiting researchers, post docs, and students with bandwidth sufficient to easily explore, discover, analyze and utilize data at other sites as well as local data sources. Further, education and outreach programs, both at BML and elsewhere will benefit directly from the enhanced infrastructure. Public education programs will be able to disseminate science directly to the public and public visitors to BML will learn about research via high-quality, interactive computer-driven interpretive displays that will access data products across the local area network. Research at UC Davis BML is highly interdisciplinary particularly in the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, with a strong linkage between physical land-sea interface data (e.g. oceanographic, meterological) and biological responses. Strong collaborations between the Bodega Ocean Observing Node and the Bodega Ocean Acidification Research  group means that large physical data sets are shared and integrated into biological (genomic and transcriptomic) data on a routine basis. The critically endangered white abalone captive breeding program under a federal ESA permit is located at BML and generates very large High Definition and 360-degree video and image files for analysis of larvae and feeding by broodstock. For data of this scale, the current LAN inhibits routine file transfer or backup during working hours. Often backup or simple file transfer between labs can take overnight. Examples of 'big data' challenges at BML include accessing computing clusters for genome and transcriptome analyses of populations of marine invertebrates as well as proteomic analyses from endangered species (white abalone) for assessment of reproductive conditioning. High-resolution numerical models and management of high-resolution ocean-observing data (e.g., high frequency radar, pCO2, O2, conductivity, fluorescence, etc.) provide the basis for biological responses to climate change as related to changes in normal upwelling patterns. Interdisciplinary environmental research intensity, diversity and collaborations are growing rapidly in part due to the coalescence of more than 90 marine science and policy faculty at UC Davis as part of the new Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute."

For example, by comparing the biomechanics of swimming in sharks, fish and whales, efficient swimming robots have been developed for undersea exploration and search and rescue. A wide array of instruments is used by different research groups to collect similar motion-capture data, and a wide array of methods is used to store and document the data, including both commercial software and locally-generated code as tools for data analysis, creating technical barriers to sharing and reusing both data and tools. Since progress in science is accelerated when scientists can share and reuse data and software, these technical barriers have hindered wide data sharing in the field of comparative biomechanics. The goal of this project is to maintain online data management and software analysis tools to accelerate research in comparative biomechanics. These tools, the Zoological Motion Analysis Portal (zmaportal.org), X-ray Motion Analysis Portal (xmaportal.org) and X-ray Motion Analysis Lab (XMALab client software) were developed with NSF support, and this project will provide routine maintenance of the open-source code base and server and storage space for hosting the online tools. These biological informatics tools are accelerating research in comparative biomechanics by enhancing data sharing and the ability to compare across species. From such comparisons, fundamental engineering concepts are discovered, that can then be applied to human engineering designs (biologically-inspired design and biomimetics). These advances promote US economic competiveness through technological innovation.<br/><br/><br/>New discoveries in the field of comparative biomechanics have often been driven by the introduction of new technologies. High-speed video imaging, X-ray imaging, XROMM and 3-D motion analysis are key components of this toolkit. A fundamental goal of comparative biomechanics is to compare species in a phylogenetic context, and thereby to extract robust relationships between phenotype (form) and biomechanical function. The tools to be maintained through this resource significantly increase the throughput of motion analysis, thereby increasing the number of species available for comparison. The XMAPortal and ZMAPortal are designed to standardize video data and metadata, thereby facilitating reproducibility and comparison among many studies of multiple species from data collected at multiple research sites. Together these products will increase the quality, quantity, reusability, and comparability of animal motion data available for comparative biomechanics research. This project will maintain valuable cyberinfrastructure tools for the study of animals in motion for comparative biomechanics research. It will support continued efforts to make these tools accessible to as wide a range of scientists and students as possible. Toward broad understanding and appreciation of science, animals in motion are inherently beautiful and fascinating to the general public. XROMM animations are visually compelling, and the xromm.org web site has received, and continues to receive, substantial interest from the lay press and television producers.

The rates associated with translation determine the time scales of protein synthesis, influence the abundance of protein molecules in cells, and have recently been shown to influence the structure and function of the protein produced. These rates are difficult to measure across the transcriptomes of organisms. The purpose of this project is to develop and apply physical bioinformatics analysis tools to measure translation-initiation and -elongation rates from experimental data generated with the next-generation sequencing technique Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-Seq). Physical Bioinformatics brings a physical-science perspective to the field of bioinformatics and permits more information to be extracted from big biological data sets than previously possible. New analysis methods will be created to measure absolute rates of translation initiation and elongation from Ribo-Seq and other data, making it possible for experimentalists to measure these quantities. This project will advance knowledge in molecular biology by determining the contribution of the elongation phase to translation control at both the global and single-gene level and whether changes in evolutionarily encoded translation-elongation kinetics modulates chaperone binding. Webinars and workshops will be held to introduce bioinformaticians to the theory underlying the methods developed in this project, running the analysis pipelines, and interpreting the results - thereby enhancing research infrastructure. These events will be recorded and publicly archived for future use by the community. As part of outreach to underserved K-12 communities, this project will introduce minority high school students to scientific research in Bioinformatics through Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science program, which arranges for these students to engage in university research experience over the summer.<br/><br/>Translation initiation and elongation rates are difficult to measure across the transcriptomes of organisms. The purpose of this project is to develop and apply physical bioinformatics analysis methods, rooted in the fields of chemistry and physics, to measure translation-initiation and -elongation rates from experimental data generated with the Next-Generation Sequencing technique Ribo-Seq. To be sure, qualitative measures of these rates utilizing heuristic or simulation-based approaches have been reported in the literature. However, these methods often do not yield absolute rates nor are they guaranteed to provide optimal solutions. Knowledge of absolute rates is essential because they are the actual rates in the system, and by knowing them their impact on other co-translational processes can be determined. Translation involves molecules and chemical reactions, meaning that analysis methods consistent with the laws of chemistry and physics are more likely to yield accurate results. Utilizing the interdisciplinary expertise in theoretical chemistry, physics, and bioinformatics, the PI's lab will develop methods in this project that: (1) optimally identify the location of the ribosome's A-site on ribosome-protected fragments generated from Ribo-Seq experiments - the first step towards measuring absolute rates; (2) measure the average codon translation rates from ribosome run-off experiments by treating translation as a form of discretized fluid flow; (3) measure individual codon translation rates from steady-state Ribo-Seq experiments; (4) measure initiation rates through a combination of Ribo-Seq, RNA-Seq and polysome profiling data. The methods will be applied to answer fundamental biological questions: To what extent is translation control of gene expression determined in the initiation versus elongation phase of translation? Do evolutionarily encoded translation-elongation kinetics that correlate with chaperone binding causally influence chaperone binding? Answers to these questions will provide insight into fundamental issues concerning how gene expression is regulated at the stage of translation, and may open new avenues for treatment when gene expression goes awry in some diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This microscope will reveal new insights into how living and chemical systems are organized and work. The project will also generate new image analysis tools for the scientific community. The microscope will enable interdisciplinary research training and enhance education through coursework and outreach to other Penn State campuses and other institutions. Integration of this microscope into a core microscopy facility will make it available to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees, and regular imaging workshops will be offered by Penn State. New teaching modules for K-12 and undergraduate educators demonstrating the science of size and the potential of super-resolution microscopy will be developed. Access and training will be assured for underrepresented students through programs including the Summer Experience in the Eberly College of Science, McNair Scholars, Women in Science and Engineering Research, and Minority Undergraduate Research Experience. Public understanding of super-resolution microscopy and its advantages will be catalyzed by multiple outreach activities and venues, including The Franklin Institute (science museum) and Penn State's Ag Progress Days, which together will expose this cutting-edge imaging technology to tens of thousands of people. The discoveries enabled by this microscope will advance the study of plant and animal development, sustainable agriculture and energy production, and the chemical interactions that define our physical environment.<br/><br/>Super-resolution microscopy is leading to dramatic new research opportunities in the life sciences, and has emerging capabilities in chemistry and materials research. Penn State will advance our optical imaging-based research through the purchase of a super-resolution microscope with both Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) capabilities. Both imaging modules are combined on a single microscope platform, and use high-magnification total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) objectives, an automated focus retention system, and an integrated multi-channel solid state laser launch. The ease of use of this commercial super-resolution microscope is a particularly appealing feature for equipment residing within Penn State's Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences Microscopy & Cytometry Facility, a multi-user core facility. Research and training with this microscope will focus on four main areas: (a) plant cell biology; (b) animal cell biology; (c) chemistry; and (d) advanced image processing and pattern recognition. Researchers in groups (a)-(c) will leverage the increased resolution offered by this system to push their research into hitherto unreachable areas of fine-scale biological processes and molecular interactions. In parallel, group (d) will collaborate with those generating super-resolution imaging data to advance our ability to recognize structures and patterns from molecular localization data. The combined SIM/STORM microscope will maximally benefit the largest number of researchers in the life and chemical sciences at Penn State by offering a high degree of flexibility for sample labeling and imaging. As an integral component of this project, faculty with research interests in advanced image analysis and pattern recognition will generate new algorithms for analyzing SIM and STORM imaging data that will be widely applicable to super-resolution microscopy and will be freely disseminated to the global scientific community."

The MiSeq system is an accessible and cost-effective sequencing platform that will be utilized by students, researchers, and faculty members to train students and broaden the research scope of scientists at the awarded institutions. The MiSeq Sequencer will be housed in the Department of Biology at SF State and will complement existing equipment in a shared molecular core facility. The instrument will enable NGS-based research projects by more than 25 research groups at SF State (and the associated Romberg Tiburon Center), CAS and San Jose State University. Access to the MiSeq will enable student and faculty researchers to expand the methodology employed in their research to address questions including how organisms adapt to changing environments, determining the mechanisms of adaptation by natural selection to long-term environmental change, and identifying critical mechanisms of disease pathogenicity. The MiSeq will be the cornerstone of institutional efforts to expand biodiversity, informatics and genomics training for students and faculty at SF State and is critical to the Department of Biology's core mission of broadening participation in science by traditionally underrepresented groups enabling them to conduct research on state-of the art instrumentation. As part of these goals, the instrument and the data it produces will be incorporated into SF State graduate and undergraduate courses and training experiences. In partnership with the Academy, a new museum exhibit will be created showcasing the use of genomic and sequence data by researchers at both institutions to explore questions of biodiversity, climate change and evolution. This exhibit will capitalize on the public outreach infrastructure of the Academy and will directly involve SF State students presenting their own research using the requested instrumentation.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the described research aims is to transform research and training at SFSU and CAS to carry out state-of-the-art genomic research. Over the last two years SF State and CAS have reached a critical mass of scientists, post-docs and graduate students with cutting edge questions and bioinformatics expertise to utilize high-throughput genomics technology in their research. These researchers fall into three overlapping research areas: Microbial and disease genomics, Comparative, evolutionary and population genomics, and Ecological and conservation genomics. Specific research applications include the following: 1) Discovery and assembly of small microbial genomes, 2) Transcriptome and RNA sequencing, 3) Microbial metagenomics, 4) PCR amplicon sequencing, 5) Reduced-representation library sequencing and 6) Low-coverage whole-genome sequencing. Availability of NGS technology will allow CAS to create a new exhibit showcasing the use of genomic data to explore questions of biodiversity, climate change and evolution at a nationally-recognized natural history museum and outreach center (with more than 1 million visitors each year). Acquisition of this instrumentation will allow the diverse student body at SFSU and CAS to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience to be top candidates for careers in the biological sciences and in the competitive and expanding field of genomics. By combining training and outreach with state-of-the-art science enabled with the Illumina MiSeq, this award will have a broad impact on biodiversity research and sustainability science in the San Francisco area and beyond."

Many of the recent advances in the biological sciences collect very large sets of DNA (genotype) and protein sequence: making sense of how their properties lead to the appearance, responses and behaviors (phenotype) of organisms requires new computational tools. Linking the genotype to the phenotype requires untangling very complicated relationships. Collecting large amounts of data for large numbers of samples means developing new tools for data processing and data modeling.  This project will develop computational tools to address both of these challenges, while investigating the effects of salt tolerance in rice. Large sets of expression data will be collected along with images of the developing plants from several imaging technologies. The images will be used to produce 3D reconstructions of the plant architecture that can be stored as digital phenotypes. It is expected that these digital phenotypes will allow plant breeders to identify traits that were not captured by standard observation methods, and find new genotype-phenotype associations. The educational activities are timely, providing training opportunities for plant biology and computer science students. As the volumes of image-derived digital data surge, image informatics is emerging as a cutting-edge discovery tool. Outreach and training activities include a summer workshop for plant phenomics and establishing a data visualization community at University of Nebraska. Project resources will be released on CyVerse to ensure wide availability. <br/><br/>High-throughput sequencing technology- driven transcriptome analyses are a commonly utilized approach for gaining molecular insights on an organism's response to environmental changes. These transcriptome-level responses and the underlying regulatory gene networks that drive phenotypic responses to changing environment are highly dynamic. With the advent of high-throughput image-based plant phenotyping, it is now possible to capture the dynamics of growth and other digital-features responding to environmental or genetic perturbation with increased temporal and spatial resolution. This project will use temporal imaging to inform the collection of time series transcriptome data with 3D-spatial sensitivity for discovering dynamic regulatory co-expression networks. Outcomes of the project will be to develop innovative algorithms to integrate heterogeneous datasets and implement it in a prototype computational framework. The platform will enable interactive, multidimensional visualization of dynamic regulatory networks with spatial and temporal resolution.

Billions of specimens (for example, plants, insects, and fossils) and their associated data (audio recordings of bird calls, field notes, geospatially referenced occurrence data, etc.) are held in more than 1000 biocollections across the United States. Until recently, these resources have largely been relegated to cabinets and drawers with few researchers, educators, or the public aware of their existence. The potential to digitally capture images of specimens and their associated data offers great promise to transform research on the environment, public health, food safety, commerce, and national security. Achieving the ambitious goal of digitizing the nation's biocollections and making them available to the broader community requires an organized, coordinated, and sustained effort. The resources created will engage a new community of users that cuts across traditional boundaries of biology, geology, computer science and software engineering and connects academic researchers with educators, policy makers, and the wider public. Cooperation with similar efforts overseas will result in a truly global resource. The purpose of this Research Coordination Network is to create such a community. <br/><br/>The NIBA Research Coordination Network will enable new research; create novel, cross-disciplinary user communities; and promote the development of software and cyberinfrastructure that will not only support collections digitization, but will have more general applicability far beyond the bounds of this field. Most importantly, it will create sustainable structures, capable of maintaining effort in this field over the long period required for full digitization of the nation's collections. The Steering Committee for the RCN will help to plan workshops and establish working committees that will evaluate and seek stakeholder input on the goals outlined in an Implementation Plan for a Network Integrated Biocollections Alliance (NIBA), a proposed mechanism for organizing and coordinating a sustained effort to digitally capture specimens and their associated data from biocollections. The RCN will engage the broader scientific community and public in an iterative process to evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of the six goals articulated in the Implementation Plan for a NIBA, which include: 1) establishing an organizational and governance structure; 2) advancing engineering of the biodiversity collections cyberinfrastructure; 3) enhancing training of existing collections staff and creating the next generation of biodiversity information managers; 4) increasing participation from a broad range of stakeholders; 5) establish an enduring and sustainable knowledge base; and, 6) infusing specimen-based learning and exploration into formal and informal science education. The products of the workshops will include published reports and plans that will guide a national effort to build the infrastructure and implement NIBA. The new research communities and collaborations that are established through this RCN will stimulate the development of new tools, such as software or new data-mining techniques. As biocollections specimens and data become more publicly available, citizen scientists, government agency personnel, K-12 educators and many others will begin to access and use this information. All products will be archived and made available at www.aibs.org."

Fresh water is a critical global resource for agriculture, electricity generation, industry, human health, and ecosystem health. As a result, there is a tremendous need to understand the functioning of freshwater ecosystems and how human activities affect these functions. The Jefferson Project is a large, interdisciplinary effort to address this need by incorporating research and technology from multiple fields of science. To monitor changes in the lake over space and time, the Smart Sensor Web includes weather stations, tributary stations, vertical profilers, and acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) equipped with IBM Smart Technology. These sensors can communicate with researchers and each other to make real-time sampling decisions over space and time. These data will be combined with historic data (35 yrs of non-automated weather, tributary, and lake chemistry data), ongoing food-web surveys, and experimental data that examine the underlying causes of how human activities can alter overall water quality. These monitoring and experimental data will then be brought together to develop integrated models of weather, run-off, lake circulation, and food webs. Assembling these components will serve as a global example of how researchers can use advanced technology for environmental monitoring, serve as a basis for real-time and responsible conservation tactics, and to attain a scientifically deep understanding of freshwater ecosystems, which are critical for global security and society. <br/><br/>The data and models that are facilitated by the Smart Sensor Web will allow us to address a wide range of transformative questions. These questions include tracking changes in phytoplankton, micro-benthos, and microbial assemblages with respect to spatial and temporal changes in physical and chemical parameters, understanding the effect of species diversity on lake ecosystem processes, and quantifying the effect of spatial and temporal food chain coupling on lake ecosystem processes. We will also be able to monitor and track anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., nutrient inputs, turbidity, and road salt), understand how climate variation is associated with shifts in lake hydrology and temperature profiles, and how water currents affect the dispersal of invasive species. Moreover, the Smart Sensor Web will allow researchers to establish modern proxies for reconstructing the lake?s history via lake coring research. The data produced by the Smart Sensor Web will be combined with many other types of data including non-automated monitoring of other lake parameters, experimental manipulations, and a diverse set of models (i.e. weather, hydrology, lake circulation, and food web models). Together, these efforts will offer the ability to conduct an integrated ecosystem assessment and a lake web observatory that will serve as a global blueprint for a revolutionary approach to understanding freshwater ecosystems. Data provided by the instrument will be used by a diverse group of faculty spanning eight departments and multiple centers at RPI. In addition to the traditional benefits of training students and disseminating results to the public through seminars and web sites, the broader impacts of the Jefferson Project extend much farther. The data, semantic data, and data derivatives will be available to scientists around the world. In addition, the >45 faculty, post-docs, and graduate students involved in the Jefferson Project will collectively conduct a massive amount of K-12 STEM education and communication to the public. Faculty and students are already involved in ongoing outreach, and we are proposing several new activities designed to visualize complex ecosystems, including a 3D online educational game simulation for middle and high school students, a visiting artist program, and a virtual artwork installation, ""The World of Plankton"". This latter installation is an interactive 3D immersive environment world to be shown in museums, art galleries, and online. These efforts will extend our outreach to diverse communities throughout art, science, education, and cultural venues."

Researchers need access to environmental data, sensors and sensor stations, remote access to field sites and equipment, access to the internet and servers, and the ability to efficiently upload and transmit data from remote locations via standardized data schemes. This project will update and expand an existing radiotelemetry network at the Black Rock Forest field station (http://blackrockforest.org) in New York. The expected impacts will be greater research productivity, increased future research capacity, expanded opportunities for collaboration through data sharing, and substantial broader community impacts through education and outreach. The new network will enable expansion of connectivity and data transmission in the more remote portions of the forest where new research efforts will be initiated.  These long-term enhancements to the Black Rock Forest's infrastructure will create opportunities for teaching and learning, dissemination of environmental information to a broader audience including the public, and for increasing the involvement of the diverse groups who interact with the field station.<br/><br/>The improvements will consist of a new off-grid wireless mesh network, extending the old network with more than twenty new, self-powered wireless access points (store and forward mesh data nodes), two new transmission towers, an application programming interface (API) to support all users, and a new research-dedicated web portal. Based on open source software, this installation will simplify aggregation of a variety of sensor types and management of different data streams for use by a wide range of researchers and institutions. The system is designed to be simple and expandable through the use of foundational modules applicable to forest environments anywhere. The new network will enable expansion of connectivity and data transmission in the more remote western side of the forest where new research efforts have been proposed. It will contribute to increased science literacy and understanding of the natural world among the 13,000 students who visit Black Rock Forest each year, increased STEM training and college preparation, increased participation particularly of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM activities, and increased activity in BRFC public and citizen science programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are also on the front lines of climate change, experiencing more rapidly changing conditions than plants elsewhere in the United States, resulting in rapid range shifts and local extinctions. The last comprehensive Flora of Alaska was completed fifty years ago, meaning that vast amounts of digital data and new taxonomic work remain poorly integrated; this is a major barrier to tracking the changing distribution of native Alaskan plants and new arrivals.  This project will build the digital infrastructure to integrate names, herbarium specimens, images, citizen science observations, and taxonomic histories and descriptions. It will be innovative in using ""taxon concepts"" to weave together the data resources. Taxon concepts offer a level of information precision beyond that of scientific plant names alone, but have yet to be used in a multi-resource database such as this; a sub-goal of the project is to promote and facilitate the use of taxon concepts more widely. As the data infrastructure is developed, the database will be populated with existing digital and scanned-paper information about the plants of Alaska, and with new data (keys, taxonomic accounts) to be generated through the collaboration of stakeholders in a new Flora of Alaska. The project will also engage the wider community of plant enthusiasts to expand contemporary species occurrence data by incorporating iNaturalist observations. Project staff will give training workshops, and travel to Alaskan villages to work with teachers, thus involving Alaskan youth in the vital process of monitoring shifts in plant distributions.   <br/><br/>This project will build an online resource that integrates the most important information about the vascular plants of Alaska. It will link the new checklist of Alaskan plant names, a product of years of research by staff of the Herbarium of the University of Alaska (ALA), and the Alaska Center for Conservation Science (ACCS), to online flora resources (the Pan-Arctic Flora and the Flora of North America), and to information digitized from Hulten's Flora of Alaska, which is the standard reference work but now nearly fifty years old. This database will link taxonomic entities to data about the physical specimens in the herbarium and in other herbaria around the world, and to geo-referenced observations of plants throughout the state, showing images of digitized specimens and of plants in the field (via iNaturalist). The project will also engage in cutting-edge deconstruction of text descriptions in its constituent floras, parsing out data on phenotypic characters of each taxon, and presenting these data in the form of identification resources and contributions to plant knowledge-bases. At the core of this data integration will be informatics infrastructure based on taxon concepts, which capture not just the names of plants, but also the historical sense in which those names were used: the hypotheses of taxonomists. To populate this taxon concept data layer, we will develop and participate in a workflow for taxon concept mapping among names used in a core set of Alaskan flora publications. Project staff will actively engage with the community of Alaskan botanists in the development of a new Flora of Alaska. Data generated by stakeholders (including taxon reviews and occurrence data) will be incorporated into the project data platform. Beyond the contribution of significantly advancing our knowledge of the plants of Alaska, this project will benefit  the university and society by training graduate and undergraduate students in biodiversity informatics and taxonomy, and engaging with training of K-12 teachers in rural villages of Alaska.

With its launch in 2002, eBird opened a new era of live, online checklisting for birders, and it soon became one of the world's largest citizen-science projects. By 2012, eBird had amassed 100 million total bird observations, and early in 2014 that number is 170 million-on track to double the previous decade's worth of data in just 2 years. With more than 200,000 citizen-science participants worldwide, eBird acts as a global-scale, real-time bird monitoring mechanism that is innovating new models of conservation. For example, a first-of-its-kind conservation project in California is using eBird models to target the flooding of rice fields in the specific places, and at precisely the right times, for waterfowl and shorebirds during migration. eBird's openly available data has been downloaded by more than 6,000 students, educators, government staff, and researchers, resulting in more than 110 peer-reviewed scientific papers. True to its beginnings, eBird is still grounded in serving as an essential tool for birding. More than 7 million people access eBird every year to explore data through interactive exploration, visualization and analysis tools that help birders find more birds.<br/><br/><br/>Much of the research in basic and applied ecology is founded in descriptions of distribution and abundance of species. Long-term, well-organized data covering broad spatial scales are necessary for documenting change, generating hypotheses for their causes, and ultimately understanding how these changes relate to overall ecosystem health and function. While collecting a single-species occurrence datum is a well-understood process, the coordinated collection, curation, access, and storage of these data is no small task. Appropriately structured and sustained, the cyberinfrastructure that supports large species occurrence datasets can add value to the data, instead of merely acting as a tool for aggregating observations. The eBird data management infrastructure provides a unique resource for students, scientists, land managers, governments and amateurs. eBird's data: (1) come from a single, consistently gathered and curated source that is openly available and widely in use, (2) represents a substantial proportion of all available data on distribution of all organisms globally, and (3) provides these data in not just minimal form but as a set of value-added products that lower the threshold of data management needed to use these data.

It will quantify fluxes of two of the most important greenhouse gases and facilitate understanding of mechanisms that regulate releases to the atmosphere. The proposed instrumentation will provide incentive for both internal and external researchers to use IBS and CC. Three very different ecological systems at IBS and CC will be instrumented for high temporal resolution of physical, chemical and biological variables. The proposed work on iconic Cedar Bog Lake and nearby water bodies would extend the research focus at CC to wetlands, rivers and lakes. The water bodies at the two stations represent a gradient of diversity that will enable comparative studies. These data will contribute to a global lakes monitoring network (GLEON), to which both Cotner and Knoll contribute. There are extensive avenues for outreach at both field stations. Data from the lakes will be displayed in real-time at visitor stations and numerous school and public tours at each site. A science in the schools program, InSciEd Out, which is focused on K-8 students will use these data to help generate hypotheses and experiments focused on how lakes and wetlands function. Lastly, this work will impact science and society by providing important infrastructure for understanding exchanges between aquatic systems and the atmosphere, a poorly understood area of limnology and atmospheric science. It will also impact society through the training of many scientists, from kindergarten through graduate school and beyond."

Males and females show differences in lifespan and aging within nearly every animal group. The reasons why this occurs is a major question in biology. This proposal will fund a fellow to receive training in molecular methods to assess aging physiology and will explore how differences between males and females may help explain differences in lifespan between them. To broaden participation of underrepresented groups in biology, the fellow is creating teacher training experiences around DataClassroom, a new software tool of his creation that was designed to teach data skills to students in grade 6-12 science classrooms. This professional development will help school districts serving large numbers of minority students to adopt technology and curricula that builds data skills as these skills increasingly become a prerequisite for scientific careers. <br/><br/>The fellow will use parallel longitudinal-studies in matched wild and lab populations of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to identify differences in longevity and rates of aging between male and female lizards, while also testing for differences in the fitness benefits of a long lifespan between males and females. This approach leverages long-term mark-recapture work in an island population of lizards where thousands of individuals have been longitudinally measured and tracked from hatching to death. The proposed work has three aims: (1) test if the relationship between age and fitness is fundamentally different for males and females, (2) test for differences in aging in a wild population using cellular and whole-organism biomarkers of aging, and for differences in selection on the reaction norm trait of aging, and (3) test the relative roles of environmentally mediated and genetic factors in any differences in the aging process. Broader impacts and broadening participation efforts are focused on increasing the capacity of science teachers in grades 6-12 to teach data skills and statistics in the science classroom.

However, scientific understanding of our increasingly urban world is limited by the availability of historical data documenting these ecological changes. This project partners the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CM) with the Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) Project, a Thematic Collections Network (TCN) involving 11 institutions in the urban corridor from New York City to Washington, D.C., to digitize herbarium specimens from the Mid-Atlantic states. Western Pennsylvania is widely recognized as an urbanized area that was transformed from an industrial powerhouse (and one of the most polluted metropolitan areas in the 19th and 20th centuries) to an emerging center for sustainability and technological innovation. This partnership will fill a ""Rust Belt"" data gap by including urban areas in Pennsylvania that have undergone remarkable environmental and ecological change over the past two centuries. CM specimens will enhance the MAM Project by adding nearly 190,000 herbarium specimens, increasing the total number of MAM specimens by more than 25%. In addition to making these valuable specimens more accessible through public databases, targeted activities will directly connect digitized data to scientists and the public, contributing to ongoing programs in invasive species management, education of nature in the city, and museum exhibition. Taken together, these activities will improve scientific and public understanding of urban environments, highlighting sustainability and the future of this increasingly common biome in the current era of global change.<br/><br/>This project connects an unrepresented, but important, Mid-Atlantic urban region to the MAM Project. Digitization of each CM specimen will result in a high-resolution image and georeferenced point, enabling biogeographic, floristic, and phenotypic analyses through space and time. Data capture, efficient workflow development, and data dissemination will follow best practices, utilizing the existing project infrastructure of the MAM project and iDigBio. Data on non-native species will be made available to PA iMapInvasives program to track the introduction and spread of harmful invasive plants in the region. Further, this project will integrate specimen images into museum exhibits, with the construction of a new exhibit highlighting specimen-based research, the importance of digitization, and the ecological and economic value of plants in cities. In collaboration with museum educators, specimen images will be used in the development of an online toolkit of free science activities for local school teachers that explore nature in urban settings. Weekly blogs will feature specimens of local interest, focusing on the urban plants of Pittsburgh. Collaborating with MAM partners, workshops will be held for local botanical clubs and citizen scientists in the Pittsburgh region to the assist in digitization, specifically joining the efforts of established projects focused on shifts in flowering times across the Eastern US and the development of a virtual flora of the Mid-Atlantic. Collectively, the project will provide research-ready data to enable a better understanding of human-mediated changes at multiple biological, geographic, and temporal scales, as well as predictions for the future ecology of urban areas.  All data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, at the moment, there are a number of barriers slowing the pace of model improvement and reducing their wider use. First, the software for using each model is unique and does not communicate well with other models. Second, because each model is unique, the tools to manage data going into models, analyze models, and visualize results are not shared. In this project PEcAn (Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer) is being developed to provide a common set of software tools for researchers and land managers to effectively work with multiple ecosystem models and data. Web technologies will be used to allow distant modeling teams to share information, work together, and better use public and private cloud and supercomputing resources. Other tools will be developed to identify model errors and combine new and existing applications into workflows to make ecological research more efficient, better forecast ecosystem services, and support evidence-based decision making. The PEcAn team will also develop training tools for new users and work with the scientific community to add more models to PEcAn. PEcAn will make ecological research more transparent, repeatable, and accountable.<br/><br/>PEcAn is an open-source ecoinformatics system designed for ecologists with a range of modeling backgrounds to be able to better and more easily parameterize, run, analyze, and assimilate data into ecosystem models at local and regional scales. This project will expand the PEcAn user community, incorporate more models, and develop tools that are more intuitive and accessible. Further, the project intends to transform tools for managing the flows of information into and out of ecosystem models into a resilient, scalable, and distributed peer-to-peer network for managing the flow of this information among modeling teams and with the broader community. To support a larger number of models, data processing workflows will be improved and tools will be developed for multi-model visualization and benchmarking. Applications that distribute analyses across the PEcAn network, cloud, and high-performance computing environments will be used to better understand model structural error using data mining approaches. Models will benchmarked over a range of environmental conditions, allowing model improvement to be tracked and users to select the best models for different applications in an informed manner. Finally, PEcAn tools will be combined into customizable workflows for real-time synthesis, forecasting, and decision support. By allowing modelers to focus on science rather than informatics, and allowing ecologists to easily compare their data to models, PEcAn will greatly accelerate the pace of model improvement and hypothesis testing. These activities are essential for improving ecosystem models and reducing uncertainty of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and carbon cycle-climate feedbacks.

Managing forests for the future depends on knowledge of their historical dynamics.  For example, after the last Ice Age many species, including trees, generally moved north as environmental conditions became more favorable, leading to large changes in population size and geographic range.  Fundamental biological questions about these shifts include: (i) how do plants establish in new locations across great distances in spite of having limited seed dispersal abilities, (ii) to what degree do species travel synchronously as communities or individually, (iii) which species moved the fastest and why, and (iv) where did species reside during the last Ice Age? Traditionally scientists have used one of three types of data to address these questions: specimens from museums and herbaria matched with contemporary environmental data, DNA sequences that hold imprints of recent and past changes, and species' presence in the fossil record including ancient pollen deposited in lake sediments. However, studies based on single data types have not been able to fully resolve the aforementioned questions, largely due to lack of integrative computational methods and infrastructure. This research will develop methods and software that, for the first time, coherently combine the three main data types and existing theory to provide a more comprehensive understanding of species' biogeographic history.  Each type of data has different strengths and weaknesses;  utilizing the strengths of each will make best use of the total information on species' range shifts. The methods developed will provide the infrastructure needed to leverage ""big data"" and enable scientific progress on significant, long-standing questions about species historical dynamics, which will serve a variety of scientific communities.  This work also serves the national interest, advancing prosperity and welfare by enabling future studies of natural environments which are an important cultural and economic resource.  Knowledge gained by using these new methods can help inform management of natural resources (i.e. forests and grasslands) and functioning ecosystems, and identify geographic regions that are resilient to environmental stress or may contain unique genetic resources to help species adapt. These new computational methods will be produced in an open-source, online, documented, and transparent code development system with which anyone can interact, as well as through two interactive workshops that will emphasize participant diversity. This project will also advance science education through broader impacts at multiple educational levels by i) partnering with an established K-12 educational program to teach ecological concepts, ii) designing a course-based undergraduate research experience, iii) producing educational videos and exhibits at two botanical gardens that collectively reach two million visitors, and iv) providing training and mentoring to early career scientists and students.<br/><br/> Despite continued improvements in data reliability and accuracy, questions about Quaternary species range shifts remain hotly debated. This debate is fueled in part by known, substantial limitations and biases of the primary data types used to reconstruct biogeographic history (i.e., fossils and inferred paleo-vegetation, current and hindcast species distribution models, and current and ancient genomic data). Conflicting results from past studies regarding the speed of range shifts and location of refugia inferred from different approaches have slowed progress in paleoecology for decades. This project will develop comprehensive, statistically robust informatic tools to coherently integrate the information content of disparate and heretofore disconnected data types and models for inferring species' genetic, demographic, and biogeographic history. The objective of this research is to build informatic infrastructure that will help scientists leverage information from multiple sources spanning space and time to (a) better estimate key demographic parameters, (b) generate maps of species distributions post-glaciation, and (c) account for uncertainty from each data type. The framework is rooted in Approximate Bayesian Computation but with additional modules that will build on the state-of-the-art in biogeographic inference. The informatic improvements will occur in four stages of increasing novelty and data integration, with specific outputs at each stage. The informatic advances will be evaluated for computational efficiency and effectiveness through analyses of both simulated data and an existing empirical dataset for a foundational tree species, green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica. This research will help scientists from many fields make the most benefit from the ongoing renaissance in methods and databases in genomics, environmental modeling, and paleo-data to help achieve better understanding of past species' dynamics (demographic growth rates, long distance dispersal, biotic velocities, etc.) at a spatial and temporal resolution that was previously unachievable. The scientific community will be involved in model and software design via open source, community development and coding on GitHub, and two hands-on workshops.

These data serve as the evidence that researchers use to make inferences and draw scientific conclusions. The process of biocuration seeks to capture these conclusions and the evidence that led to them in a standardized way so that the information is readily accessible to the entire scientific community. The most efficient way to accomplish this is to use an ontology to describe the evidence types. An ontology is a controlled vocabulary of terms where each term is carefully defined and linked to other terms by precise relationships. The Evidence Ontology (EO) is a community standard for describing types of research evidence used to support scientific conclusions in biological research. The EO is used by some of the world?s most prominent protein databases and genomic resources to capture evidence information. The goal of this project is to improve EO and promote its use by a larger community of researchers. The EO will be promoted through outreach, training, and education efforts, including workshops and internships. Broader impacts will include outreach efforts to Baltimore City Public Schools students focusing on teaching the importance of structuring information in a controlled way. Summer interns will engage in EO development and bioinformatics activities. A vast number of scientists researching a wide range of biological topics will benefit from the continued development and expanded use of the EO.<br/><br/>The ability to describe both evidence and assertion method (i.e. whether a human or a machine makes a statement) in a consistent and computable fashion is essential for multiple reasons. Capture of methodology is central to the scientific method and can impact evaluation of results, associating structured evidence with stored data allows for selective data queries and retrieval from even the largest databases, and structured evidence systems make automated quality control possible, which is essential for large-scale data management. Nearly 30 biological resources including protein databases, model organism databases, phenotype resources, and gene expression databases currently are using the Evidence Ontology (EO) to capture evidence information, support structured data queries, group related data, or establish quality control mechanisms. EO will be developed further to address structural issues, clarify the main axis, add logical constraints, and map EO to related resources. New evidence types will be continually added to the ontology based on the needs of the research community. A web resource will be created that includes improved visualization tools for evidence and data associated with EO terms, complete user documentation, and downloadable content. EO will also develop quality assessment methodologies to enable researchers to better evaluate evidence. Outreach, training, and education will be conducted to grow the EO user base and educate researchers and students about the value and means of capturing evidence. EO developers will present at scientific conferences, publish papers, host interns, and conduct workshops and science outreach activities. By improving EO and increasing user awareness, researchers will be better able to make the most of evidence and associated data. For more information, please visit: http://evidenceontology.org."

Different features require different data collection modalities,  and merging these different types of data correctly is one of several technically challenging tasks this research will perform.  This type of multiscale, multimodal brain mapping is one of the scientific Grand Challenges, as such it is a top U.S.A. research priority, one recognized by the BRAIN initiative. This award will contribute to NSF's commitment to develop a National Brain Observatory (NBO) to enable this initiative. By integrating structural and functional connectomics, this project will show how they work together when brain circuits change with different activities. By deciphering and measuring of real-time neural codes this research will let us better understand how brain activities create unique cognitive and behavioral capabilities. The project includes plans to integrate the research data and techniques into educational and outreach activities, encouraging interest in neuroscience research in the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to create a multiscale, multimodal mouse connectome for better understanding of brain function. Specifically, the project aims include: 1) construct, cross-validate, fuse, and integrate multiscale multimodal mouse brain connectomes, including macro-scale mouse connectomes based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), Susceptibility Tensor Imaging (STI) data, and meso-scale mouse connectomes based on publicly available serial two-photon tomography data; 2) utilize multiscale structural connectomes for exploration of functional connectomics and circuitry dynamics, in particular, focusing on the fear memory system; and 3) design, develop and disseminate the structural and functional connectomics tools and resources to the brain mapping research community. To achieve the above goals, the investigators will design and apply innovative computational and informatics methodologies and approaches for multiscale mouse connectomics research. Specifically, both mesoscale and macroscale structural connectivity data will be used as follows. First, the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (ACA) will be used, which provides a comprehensive meso-scale mouse brain neuronal connectivity map via anterogradely traced axonal projections using serial two-photon tomography from over one thousand different injection sites. Second, at the macro-scale, the noninvasive diffusion tensor (DT) microimaging technique will be used to track global fiber connections in the whole mouse brain at the micron-scale spatial resolution. Subsequently data will be fused and integrated, to acquire the advantages of both meso-scale serial two-photon tomography data and macro-scale DT microimaging data when constructing and cross-validating multi-scale, multimodal mouse connectomes. Finally, these structural connectomes will be the basis for exploring functional connectomics and circuitry dynamics, thus significantly advancing the understanding of brain structure and function and their relationships.

These characteristics, also known as functional traits, include features such as length, height, shape, weight, growth rate, sex, and reproductive state. Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ""resolution revolution"" has placed within reach structures that were previously inaccessible with other structural biology techniques. As a consequence, there is a growing interest among scientists in the expanded capabilities of cryo-EM. While previous generations of cryo-EM users were familiar with Linux and the HPC tools necessary to process the data, this is not the case with many of the structural biologists now attracted to the technique. We see this as a major barrier to the growth of cryo-EM. In order to remove this barrier, this project will develop an easy-to-use web platform, or ""science gateway"",  that will interface with HPC resources, data processing algorithms, and long-term data storage options, allowing inexperienced users to access the full potential of cryo-EM. A prototype gateway (COSMIC2: Cryo-EM Open Source Multiplatform Infrastructure for Cloud Computing) has been developed in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), using its substantial HPC resources. This project will turn this early prototype into a resource that will benefit the structural biology community nationwide and outline all the features of a fully-developed gateway. <br/><br/>The proposed COSMIC2 gateway will provide a large pool of computing time for cryo-EM users through an XSEDE allocation to the PIs; an easy-to-use web portal allowing users to select cryo-EM analysis routines; novel algorithms to streamline data processing, removing manual user intervention; mechanisms for viewing output data through the web interface; and long-term data storage solutions by connecting COSMIC2 to cloud storage providers (e.g. Google Drive, Box). The COSMIC2 gateway will optimally install and test major cryo-EM data processing software to ensure that they are using computational resources efficiently. The transformative impact of this project will come from the adoption of the COSMIC2 gateway by the broad structural biology community, to which it will bring national HPC resources and the power of cryo-EM while the removing any obstacles in accessing them. The current prototype for the resource may be seen at http://cosmic-cryoem.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding such communities is therefore important to many fields, such as agriculture, biogeochemistry, oceanography, biology, ecology, and so on. However, the overwhelming majority of environmental microbes have never been isolated and grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a key to understanding microbial communities is the resolution of genomes from culture-independent sequencing (metagenomics), where the genomes of individual species are reconstructed from a mixed metagenome in a process called ""binning"". However, inaccurate binning hampers the ability to gain fundamental insights into microbial communities, for example in situations where it is uncertain whether all of a particular genome has been recovered from the dataset, or that all sequences in a bin are really from the same genome. In this regard, existing binning methods have various problems, including (1) poor performance with highly complex metagenomes, (2) assumption that all input sequences are bacterial, leading to impure bins, (3) lack of internal validation that bins make biological sense, and (4) ignoring the presence of multiple closely related strains and genome variability within a species (the ""pangenome"" concept). The goals of this project are to develop a binning method that can handle the novelty and complexity of even the most diverse microbial communities on Earth, such as soil. The methods developed have the potential to transform the study of microbial communities, enabling the determination of ""who is doing what?"" even in highly complex communities associated with higher organisms with unknown genomes. With increased understanding of microbial communities through genome-resolved metagenomics, it will eventually be possible to model and predict complex emergent behavior of communities and delineate how their capabilities are different from the component organisms in isolation. This project also aims to address the current shortfall of STEM graduates in the United States, many of whom initially express interest in STEM fields but then are lost to other majors. Research experiences have been shown to help increase persistent interest in STEM, but they often reach only a few students, and do not necessarily allow all students equitable access. This project will establish a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in the analysis of metagenomics data, aimed at undeclared majors, to address these problems.<br/><br/>In developing improved binning methods, the research will focus on (1) developing algorithms to leverage taxonomy information and universally-conserved marker genes for binning both well-characterized and divergent species in single samples, and (2) developing pangenome-aware algorithms to leverage co-occurrence of the same species in multiple samples for binning. This approach will maximize the information that will be gleaned from single samples, while avoiding assumptions on genome conservation within and between samples when leveraging data from multiple samples. The developed methods will be validated using simulated metagenomes as well as real data from soil. Specifically, soil communities will be followed longitudinally after forest fires, where most microbes are killed and then diversity slowly increases to the baseline. In addition to validating the performance of binning methods, these data will be used to investigate various hypotheses on why soil is able to maintain such high levels of microbial diversity. The CURE course which will be designed and implemented during this project will aim to develop skills in ""big data"" analysis that are becoming increasingly important in all branches of science and expose students to the analysis of shotgun metagenome data. The course will synergize with the highly popular Tiny Earth course, which is currently offered to nearly 10,000 students in 41 US states and 14 countries. The Tiny Earth network will act as a central deposit for data that can be used by institutions that lack resources for shotgun sequencing. Over time this data repository will facilitate the exploration of ""big questions"", thus crowdsourcing student-led discovery. <br/><br/>For further information, visit http://jason-c-kwan.github.io/CAREER_results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, past environmental conditions may interact with past tree growth patterns to affect current tree growth. Understanding the role of past conditions for predicting current and future growth responses of trees is expected to be important for predicting how trees, forests, and the terrestrial biosphere in general, may be impacted by future environmental changes, such as those anticipated to occur in tandem with climate change. However, methods for inferring the importance of past conditions for current processes (e.g., tree growth) are not well developed. Thus, this study develops statistical and computing methods for quantifying the past (antecedent) factors governing tree growth, with specific focus on identifying the time scales over which past climate conditions and past tree growth patterns affect current tree growth. This study draws upon large amounts of existing data on annual tree growth (""tree rings"") available on-line for multiple tree species across the southwestern US, and it will contribute additional data via a focused field study that will sample several species in this region. The project will train at least three graduate students from diverse disciplines (ecology/biology, modeling/statistics, computing/software development) and several undergraduate students. Results and data generated by this study will be used to develop education modules related to new undergraduate coursework and short courses aimed at training early career scientists. <br/><br/>Environmental conditions averaged over past days, weeks, months, seasons, or years are important predictors of plant and ecosystem productivity. For example, tree-ring studies indicate that tree growth is affected by antecedent exogenous (e.g., past climate) and endogenous (e.g., past ring widths) factors, but existing analysis methods do not explicitly evaluate the role of each factor.To address this need, this study will (1) develop a stochastic antecedent model (SAM) for quantifying antecedent climatic and endogenous conditions and their influence on tree growth, (2) apply the SAM to estimate the time-scales over which antecedent factors affect tree growth for multiple species across multiple sites in the Southwest, (3) identify potential physiological mechanisms underlying the antecedent effects on tree growth, and (4) develop software for more general applications of SAM and for simulating and visualizing tree growth. This study combines large datasets, field studies, literature data, Bayesian synthesis, and an individual-based model (IBM) of tree growth and physiology. This study is expected to lend insight into the role trees play as integrators of past environments and physiological states, and the SAM approach should improve our ability to forecast plant and ecosystem responses to climate change, disturbances, or other perturbations. Importantly, the general SAM framework for quantifying the temporal properties of the antecedent conditions and their effects on the process of interest will be broadly applicable to a wide range of fields. To address the aforementioned research objectives, this project will provide interdisciplinary training for a post-doc, 3 graduate students (ecology, statistics, computer science), and multiple undergraduates. Products from this study will be incorporated into a new undergraduate seminar at ASU, a Bayesian modeling workshop organized for annual ecology meetings (ESA), and a 2-week summer course in Bayesian methods aimed at early career and senior ecological scientists. Two software (R) packages will be developed, one for SAM and one for the IBM. Data generated from this study will be made publically and globally available via data repositories.

Managing forests for the future depends on knowledge of their historical dynamics.  For example, after the last Ice Age many species, including trees, generally moved north as environmental conditions became more favorable, leading to large changes in population size and geographic range.  Fundamental biological questions about these shifts include: (i) how do plants establish in new locations across great distances in spite of having limited seed dispersal abilities, (ii) to what degree do species travel synchronously as communities or individually, (iii) which species moved the fastest and why, and (iv) where did species reside during the last Ice Age? Traditionally scientists have used one of three types of data to address these questions: specimens from museums and herbaria matched with contemporary environmental data, DNA sequences that hold imprints of recent and past changes, and species' presence in the fossil record including ancient pollen deposited in lake sediments. However, studies based on single data types have not been able to fully resolve the aforementioned questions, largely due to lack of integrative computational methods and infrastructure. This research will develop methods and software that, for the first time, coherently combine the three main data types and existing theory to provide a more comprehensive understanding of species' biogeographic history.  Each type of data has different strengths and weaknesses;  utilizing the strengths of each will make best use of the total information on species' range shifts. The methods developed will provide the infrastructure needed to leverage ""big data"" and enable scientific progress on significant, long-standing questions about species historical dynamics, which will serve a variety of scientific communities.  This work also serves the national interest, advancing prosperity and welfare by enabling future studies of natural environments which are an important cultural and economic resource.  Knowledge gained by using these new methods can help inform management of natural resources (i.e. forests and grasslands) and functioning ecosystems, and identify geographic regions that are resilient to environmental stress or may contain unique genetic resources to help species adapt. These new computational methods will be produced in an open-source, online, documented, and transparent code development system with which anyone can interact, as well as through two interactive workshops that will emphasize participant diversity. This project will also advance science education through broader impacts at multiple educational levels by i) partnering with an established K-12 educational program to teach ecological concepts, ii) designing a course-based undergraduate research experience, iii) producing educational videos and exhibits at two botanical gardens that collectively reach two million visitors, and iv) providing training and mentoring to early career scientists and students.<br/><br/> Despite continued improvements in data reliability and accuracy, questions about Quaternary species range shifts remain hotly debated. This debate is fueled in part by known, substantial limitations and biases of the primary data types used to reconstruct biogeographic history (i.e., fossils and inferred paleo-vegetation, current and hindcast species distribution models, and current and ancient genomic data). Conflicting results from past studies regarding the speed of range shifts and location of refugia inferred from different approaches have slowed progress in paleoecology for decades. This project will develop comprehensive, statistically robust informatic tools to coherently integrate the information content of disparate and heretofore disconnected data types and models for inferring species' genetic, demographic, and biogeographic history. The objective of this research is to build informatic infrastructure that will help scientists leverage information from multiple sources spanning space and time to (a) better estimate key demographic parameters, (b) generate maps of species distributions post-glaciation, and (c) account for uncertainty from each data type. The framework is rooted in Approximate Bayesian Computation but with additional modules that will build on the state-of-the-art in biogeographic inference. The informatic improvements will occur in four stages of increasing novelty and data integration, with specific outputs at each stage. The informatic advances will be evaluated for computational efficiency and effectiveness through analyses of both simulated data and an existing empirical dataset for a foundational tree species, green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica. This research will help scientists from many fields make the most benefit from the ongoing renaissance in methods and databases in genomics, environmental modeling, and paleo-data to help achieve better understanding of past species' dynamics (demographic growth rates, long distance dispersal, biotic velocities, etc.) at a spatial and temporal resolution that was previously unachievable. The scientific community will be involved in model and software design via open source, community development and coding on GitHub, and two hands-on workshops. Results from this project can be found online at https://github.com/orgs/TIMBERhub.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This ""resolution revolution"" has placed within reach structures that were previously inaccessible with other structural biology techniques. As a consequence, there is a growing interest among scientists in the expanded capabilities of cryo-EM. While previous generations of cryo-EM users were familiar with Linux and the HPC tools necessary to process the data, this is not the case with many of the structural biologists now attracted to the technique. We see this as a major barrier to the growth of cryo-EM. In order to remove this barrier, this project will develop an easy-to-use web platform, or ""science gateway"",  that will interface with HPC resources, data processing algorithms, and long-term data storage options, allowing inexperienced users to access the full potential of cryo-EM. A prototype gateway (COSMIC2: Cryo-EM Open Source Multiplatform Infrastructure for Cloud Computing) has been developed in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), using its substantial HPC resources. This project will turn this early prototype into a resource that will benefit the structural biology community nationwide and outline all the features of a fully-developed gateway. <br/><br/>The proposed COSMIC2 gateway will provide a large pool of computing time for cryo-EM users through an XSEDE allocation to the PIs; an easy-to-use web portal allowing users to select cryo-EM analysis routines; novel algorithms to streamline data processing, removing manual user intervention; mechanisms for viewing output data through the web interface; and long-term data storage solutions by connecting COSMIC2 to cloud storage providers (e.g. Google Drive, Box). The COSMIC2 gateway will optimally install and test major cryo-EM data processing software to ensure that they are using computational resources efficiently. The transformative impact of this project will come from the adoption of the COSMIC2 gateway by the broad structural biology community, to which it will bring national HPC resources and the power of cryo-EM while the removing any obstacles in accessing them. The current prototype for the resource may be seen at http://cosmic-cryoem.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, at the moment, there are a number of barriers slowing the pace of model improvement and reducing their wider use. First, the software for using each model is unique and does not communicate well with other models. Second, because each model is unique, the tools to manage data going into models, analyze models, and visualize results are not shared. In this project PEcAn (Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer) is being developed to provide a common set of software tools for researchers and land managers to effectively work with multiple ecosystem models and data. Web technologies will be used to allow distant modeling teams to share information, work together, and better use public and private cloud and supercomputing resources. Other tools will be developed to identify model errors and combine new and existing applications into workflows to make ecological research more efficient, better forecast ecosystem services, and support evidence-based decision making. The PEcAn team will also develop training tools for new users and work with the scientific community to add more models to PEcAn. PEcAn will make ecological research more transparent, repeatable, and accountable.<br/><br/>PEcAn is an open-source ecoinformatics system designed for ecologists with a range of modeling backgrounds to be able to better and more easily parameterize, run, analyze, and assimilate data into ecosystem models at local and regional scales. This project will expand the PEcAn user community, incorporate more models, and develop tools that are more intuitive and accessible. Further, the project intends to transform tools for managing the flows of information into and out of ecosystem models into a resilient, scalable, and distributed peer-to-peer network for managing the flow of this information among modeling teams and with the broader community. To support a larger number of models, data processing workflows will be improved and tools will be developed for multi-model visualization and benchmarking. Applications that distribute analyses across the PEcAn network, cloud, and high-performance computing environments will be used to better understand model structural error using data mining approaches. Models will benchmarked over a range of environmental conditions, allowing model improvement to be tracked and users to select the best models for different applications in an informed manner. Finally, PEcAn tools will be combined into customizable workflows for real-time synthesis, forecasting, and decision support. By allowing modelers to focus on science rather than informatics, and allowing ecologists to easily compare their data to models, PEcAn will greatly accelerate the pace of model improvement and hypothesis testing. These activities are essential for improving ecosystem models and reducing uncertainty of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and carbon cycle-climate feedbacks.

Managing forests for the future depends on knowledge of their historical dynamics.  For example, after the last Ice Age many species, including trees, generally moved north as environmental conditions became more favorable, leading to large changes in population size and geographic range.  Fundamental biological questions about these shifts include: (i) how do plants establish in new locations across great distances in spite of having limited seed dispersal abilities, (ii) to what degree do species travel synchronously as communities or individually, (iii) which species moved the fastest and why, and (iv) where did species reside during the last Ice Age? Traditionally scientists have used one of three types of data to address these questions: specimens from museums and herbaria matched with contemporary environmental data, DNA sequences that hold imprints of recent and past changes, and species' presence in the fossil record including ancient pollen deposited in lake sediments. However, studies based on single data types have not been able to fully resolve the aforementioned questions, largely due to lack of integrative computational methods and infrastructure. This research will develop methods and software that, for the first time, coherently combine the three main data types and existing theory to provide a more comprehensive understanding of species' biogeographic history.  Each type of data has different strengths and weaknesses;  utilizing the strengths of each will make best use of the total information on species' range shifts. The methods developed will provide the infrastructure needed to leverage 'big data' and enable scientific progress on significant, long-standing questions about species historical dynamics, which will serve a variety of scientific communities.  This work also serves the national interest, advancing prosperity and welfare by enabling future studies of natural environments which are an important cultural and economic resource.  Knowledge gained by using these new methods can help inform management of natural resources (i.e. forests and grasslands) and functioning ecosystems, and identify geographic regions that are resilient to environmental stress or may contain unique genetic resources to help species adapt. These new computational methods will be produced in an open-source, online, documented, and transparent code development system with which anyone can interact, as well as through two interactive workshops that will emphasize participant diversity. This project will also advance science education through broader impacts at multiple educational levels by i) partnering with an established K-12 educational program to teach ecological concepts, ii) designing a course-based undergraduate research experience, iii) producing educational videos and exhibits at two botanical gardens that collectively reach two million visitors, and iv) providing training and mentoring to early career scientists and students.<br/><br/> Despite continued improvements in data reliability and accuracy, questions about Quaternary species range shifts remain hotly debated. This debate is fueled in part by known, substantial limitations and biases of the primary data types used to reconstruct biogeographic history (i.e., fossils and inferred paleo-vegetation, current and hindcast species distribution models, and current and ancient genomic data). Conflicting results from past studies regarding the speed of range shifts and location of refugia inferred from different approaches have slowed progress in paleoecology for decades. This project will develop comprehensive, statistically robust informatic tools to coherently integrate the information content of disparate and heretofore disconnected data types and models for inferring species' genetic, demographic, and biogeographic history. The objective of this research is to build informatic infrastructure that will help scientists leverage information from multiple sources spanning space and time to (a) better estimate key demographic parameters, (b) generate maps of species' distributions post-glaciation, and (c) account for uncertainty from each data type. The framework is rooted in Approximate Bayesian Computation but with additional modules that will build on the state-of-the-art in biogeographic inference. The informatic improvements will occur in four stages of increasing novelty and data integration, with specific outputs at each stage. The informatic advances will be evaluated for computational efficiency and effectiveness through analyses of both simulated data and an existing empirical dataset for a foundational tree species, green ash, Fraxinus pennsylvanica. This research will help scientists from many fields make the most benefit from the ongoing renaissance in methods and databases in genomics, environmental modeling, and paleo-data to help achieve better understanding of past species' dynamics (demographic growth rates, long distance dispersal, biotic velocities, etc.) at a spatial and temporal resolution that was previously unachievable.

This ""resolution revolution"" has placed within reach structures that were previously inaccessible with other structural biology techniques. As a consequence, there is a growing interest among scientists in the expanded capabilities of cryo-EM. While previous generations of cryo-EM users were familiar with Linux and the HPC tools necessary to process the data, this is not the case with many of the structural biologists now attracted to the technique. We see this as a major barrier to the growth of cryo-EM. In order to remove this barrier, this project will develop an easy-to-use web platform, or ""science gateway"",  that will interface with HPC resources, data processing algorithms, and long-term data storage options, allowing inexperienced users to access the full potential of cryo-EM. A prototype gateway (COSMIC2: Cryo-EM Open Source Multiplatform Infrastructure for Cloud Computing) has been developed in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), using its substantial HPC resources. This project will turn this early prototype into a resource that will benefit the structural biology community nationwide and outline all the features of a fully-developed gateway. <br/><br/>The proposed COSMIC2 gateway will provide a large pool of computing time for cryo-EM users through an XSEDE allocation to the PIs; an easy-to-use web portal allowing users to select cryo-EM analysis routines; novel algorithms to streamline data processing, removing manual user intervention; mechanisms for viewing output data through the web interface; and long-term data storage solutions by connecting COSMIC2 to cloud storage providers (e.g. Google Drive, Box). The COSMIC2 gateway will optimally install and test major cryo-EM data processing software to ensure that they are using computational resources efficiently. The transformative impact of this project will come from the adoption of the COSMIC2 gateway by the broad structural biology community, to which it will bring national HPC resources and the power of cryo-EM while the removing any obstacles in accessing them. The current prototype for the resource may be seen at http://cosmic-cryoem.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This transferred DNA often encodes new functions that expand an organism's niche, change its relationships with its host or provide a competitive edge against other organisms within its environment. For example, antibiotic resistance genes are frequently observed to be transferred between organisms. New high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies now allow researchers to simultaneously sequence data from millions of different bacterial species in a single sample, called metagenome sequencing. Thousands of publicly available metagenomic sequence datasets exist for samples from very diverse ecologies, including: gut microbiomes from humans, animals and insects, soil and root communities, surfaces in built environments, hydrothermal mats and vents, wastewater treatment plants, freshwater sources and marine ecosystems. Using these datasets, the research team will develop a suite of computational tools for examining the mobile gene content of these datasets, to identify those genes that may shape the response of microbial communities to stress. Graduate students will carry out the research under the direction of the PI, while undergraduates will be trained to use the resulting methods through a series of hackathons aimed at building the computational science community focused on microbial community research. Recruiting efforts will be aimed at measurably increasing the diversity in computational biology throughout the greater Finger Lakes region. <br/><br/>Functional characterization of microbial communities is often performed using metagenomic shotgun data, obtained by sequencing microbial samples in their entirety. Yet, despite its importance, few methods exist to distinguish genes that are inherited versus those genes which have been mobilized and transferred between organisms in this type of short-read sequence data. By providing new computational methods for reconstructing mobile genetic elements in short-read data, researchers can tap into the huge resource of existing metagenomic data to examine the role of HGT in shaping the functions of natural microbial communities. This research will be transformative for all fields of microbiology, including clinical microbiology, microbiome research, environmental microbiology, and microbial engineering."

However, at the moment, there are a number of barriers slowing the pace of model improvement and reducing their wider use. First, the software for using each model is unique and does not communicate well with other models. Second, because each model is unique, the tools to manage data going into models, analyze models, and visualize results are not shared. In this project PEcAn (Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer) is being developed to provide a common set of software tools for researchers and land managers to effectively work with multiple ecosystem models and data.

This research resource is especially important in documenting the insect diversity of the southern Coastal Plain, including many imperiled habitats.  The collection also holds specimens of disease vectors as well as agricultural and forestry pests that have been documented in Mississippi for the past 120 years, and these specimens are important for evaluating their past, current, and future distributions.  The museum's identification center provides early detection of invasive species that threaten the biosecurity of food, fiber, and forests in 13 states.  The acquisition of specimens from these activities has resulted in unique holdings among biological collections in the U.S., and these include major collections of ants and grasshoppers.  More than 100 species new to science have been described based on specimens held in the collection with many more still to be described.  During the past five years, the museum has hosted 112 visiting researchers from 42 institutions in 25 states and five other countries.  Concurrently, the museum has an active education and outreach program with curricula designed for elementary students and table events involving displays and informative hand-outs provided at public events.  The annual growth of collection holdings during the past five years has approached 30% because of fieldwork, donations, trap samples from other states, and acquisition of other institutional collections.  At present the museum is over full capacity, with cabinets holding specimens limiting access in hallways and offices, and no space is available for future additions of specimens.<br/><br/>This project has three objectives.  The first is to expand storage space for research specimens by acquisition of a compactor system that will include moveable carriages on rails that hold cabinets.  This compactor system will provide an estimated 30% increase in capacity.  The second objective is to resolve the current hazards of storage of flammable preservatives in a multi-use building that includes classrooms for students.  Almost 400,000 curated specimens and a large number of bulk samples are currently stored in ethanol and held in various rooms and hallways (some adjacent to classrooms) of the Clay Lyle Entomology Building.  This concentration of specimens in alcohol has presented a safety hazard because the volatility of the preservative.  The acquisition of a walk-in refrigerated unit, located outside the building, would alleviate the current hazards of storing specimens in ethanol in the building.  The third objective will be the digitization of specimen label data for ants and grasshoppers.  Both ants and grasshoppers have ecological and economic significance to the public, especially for invasive species of ants.  The museum has the third largest collections of both groups of insects in eastern U.S., but specimen data are currently unavailable to others.  The digitization effort will make these data available to researchers and the public through data sharing with iDigBio (iDigBio.org) and other global resources such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these traits provides insights into how communities of different types of animals come together and how species and communities respond to changes in their environment over time, which is critical for conservation efforts. However, very little information about functional traits is available, and what is available is difficult to combine with other data. How these traits are influenced by environmental changes - such as climate change, pollution, urbanization and human predation - and how they shift over longer timescales are poorly understood, and the need for this information is outstripping the speed with which scientists can collect these data. Digitized collections of animals representing life from the past two million years contain a treasure trove of information about these individuals' functional traits, but these data are stored in multiple places and in different formats. Researchers may have recorded dates differently, for example, or used a variety of terms to describe a single physical feature. Making these data widely available in standardized formats could help scientists study changes in functional traits through time, linking their observations of traits of modern animals to those from fossil and archaeological records. The Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies (FuTRES) project will gather trait data from digitized records; to engage communities of researchers to make these data available, standardized, and useable; and to develop a more complete workflow for using these data in research. <br/><br/>Functional trait data have revolutionized ecology and are transforming paleontology, but acquiring them requires extensive labor, not only in measuring traits but in managing and communicating the resulting data. When trait data are lacking, researchers substitute average values, or other characteristics like behavioral or dietary categories. These substitutes - assigned at the species level - obscure intraspecific changes in traits. FuTRES fills the clear need for informatics tools that give researchers access to existing trait data and a place to store new data as they are generated. FuTRES is assembling a varied collection of existing trait data, building a pipeline that converts data to an integrated, semantically enriched form, and developing an Application Programming Interface (API) and web platform to serve the data. One of the key innovations of FuTRES is the use of ontologies, an information science approach that creates computer-readable definitions of traits and describes the interrelationships of traits, organisms, collecting events, and other entities. In this way, FuTRES will make functional trait data searchable through reference to time, space, and vertebrate anatomy.  FuTRES will also provide access to trait data via popular data portals (e.g., VertNet) and software such as R, opening the data to scientists in biodiversity and other domains. The toolkit will be tested with mammalian use cases that leverage the massive scale of the unlocked data.  In sum, newly created access mechanisms and tools will provide novel approaches for analyses of trait variation across space and time, providing researchers in disparate fields discovery capabilities for relevant data that would otherwise have been invisible to them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 30% (or 120,000) of these unique specimens are housed in two herbaria at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), one of which is the State's oldest herbarium. Together the NMSU herbaria represent the premier plant reference resource for the southern half of New Mexico, adjacent states, and northern Mexico. The goals of the project are to consolidate the NMSU herbaria, modernize their collections data management infrastructure, and update their management procedures, ultimately preserving the collections long-term, while broadening the data accessibility for education, research, and public use. With a multidisciplinary team of botanical researchers and local science educators, a series of academic and outreach initiatives will be implemented to increase literacy in the plant sciences within different sectors of the population. At NMSU, an official Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), researchers will pursue the recruitment and engagement of students, using hands-on experiences aimed at the care, protection and use of herbarium specimens and their associated data. Skills learned will improve participation in further education and training opportunities (e.g., graduate school) in STEM fields, while increasing downstream employment prospects. Through partnership with a local scientific education non-profit organization, the project will develop comprehensive botanical outreach materials to increase awareness and interest in natural history collections, plant biology and biodiversity, and biogeography among at least 1,500 K-12 students in an underserved Hispanic region located in southern New Mexico.<br/><br/>Activities and expected outcomes include: 1) physical preservation, curation, and integration of herbarium specimens into a unified online digital herbarium (e.g., all specimens databased, barcoded, and imaged), 2) update of currently insecure, disparate databases of the herbaria into a single modern natural history collection management system, 3) acquisition of specimen data from a backlog of important uncurated specimens, 4) development of comprehensive botanical outreach and educational kits for local K-12 students, 5) training of undergraduate research assistants, and 6) implementation of professional workshops, and a crowdsourcing online campaign, all specifically tailored to a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g., students via NMSU's Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies, curators of other natural history collections on campus, land managers and owners, researchers, and citizen scientists). The collaborative nature of the project across campus and the region leverages knowledge and expertise in efficient and exciting directions, creating new research and outreach opportunities that make use of these important herbarium collections and their valuable and unique biodiversity information.

The Center for Biology with X-ray Lasers (BioXFEL) will use the LCLS's laser x-ray source to attack recalcitrant structural biology problems and apply the gained knowledge and expertise to the development of tools and techniques that will be widely applicable in structural biology. The x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) at the LCLS brings at least four new modalities to the fore.  (1) Many macromolecules that appear not to crystallize actually form nanocrystals (as small as 10 nm on edge), and the ability to study nanocrystals is possible with XFELs.  (2) The short XFEL pulse length allows observation of macromolecular dynamics. (3) XFELs dramatically increase the information yield from x-ray solution scattering.  (4) As beam technology develops, studies of single particles - the ultimate nanocrystal - will become possible.  <br/><br/>Research plan: XFEL-based imaging brings an unprecedented combination of spatial and temporal resolution to bear on biological samples.   BioXFEL will develop every aspect of this imaging work: growth of nanocrystals; specimen delivery into a tiny XFEL beam; data processing and phasing algorithms; molecular movies and more. In each case, the difficulty varies. Conventional crystallography of larger crystals provides a firm platform for nanocrystal work.  At the other extreme, non-crystalline, single-particle studies will require creative developments to achieve successful imaging.  The integrative approach of the Science and Technology Center (STC) will be critical to meeting these and other challenges. Within BioXFEL each experiment will also be a test of hardware and software that will provide a platform for improvement.<br/><br/>Scientific legacy: BioXFEL expects to leave the scientific community with:  (a) Hardware and software innovations and developments that will enable facile implementation of an array of XFEL structural biology experiments spanning a broad range of specimen types and dynamic regimes. (b) A portfolio of successful structural projects that provide key insights and illustrate the capacities of the XFEL. (c) A diverse community of talented scholars in the US and internationally, with deep interest in and commitment to XFEL science, who will nucleate and promote new projects. (d) Broadened public awareness of XFEL science in particular and of biological imaging in general.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>Important constituencies: BioXFEL will implement a far-ranging, integrated plan to create constituencies that benefit from the efforts of the STC and contribute to it. The principal constituencies are: students and trainees; a community of scholars that will nucleate around XFEL science and technology development; a larger scientific community that is aware of the capabilities and importance of XFELs; and the public at large. <br/><br/>Education: BioXFEL spans seven academic campuses. Distributive education and professional development training will be accomplished in the CLIMB program (designed to promote advanced skills for interdisciplinary research) through multiple means, including inter-campus on-line course modules for aspects of XFEL science. An integrated web of training and personal interactions will build the current and future BioXFEL community. Linked to this is the ""Scientific Villages"", project-driven educational outreach courses associated with XFEL science, which is being created at Arizona State University. <br/><br/>Diversity will be integrated into the fabric of BioXFEL's human resources and education programs. The CLIMB program which enrolls approximately 60% underrepresented minority students, recruits students to its broad range of enrichment programs from a variety of sources including McNair Scholars and visits to a variety of undergraduate-oriented events such as SACNAS. This program will be expanded to cover all campuses participating in BioXFEL.<br/><br/>Knowledge transfer is a key component of a distributed center. BioXFEL will communicate with users and potential users through: (1) distribution of software, representative data sets and related information, through a computing resource at The University at Buffalo; (2) indexing in Science Citation Index databases of protocols and other important information that are now often hidden in silos; (3) short-term visits to BioXFEL campuses and other facilities to train colleagues in the use of specimen delivery systems, or for purposes of collaboration; (4) a comprehensive web presence."

It will support a network of institutional partners that are committed to providing internship and mentoring opportunities to youths interested in authentic research projects. The proposed work will build on a current research immersion program--the Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP) at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. SSFRP serves high school students, mainly from underrepresented and underserved communities, who work with college students, science teachers, and researchers around a specific science problem. Over the past decade, the program has had demonstrable impact, including attendance to college, and students' selection of STEM majors. Tracking data indicates that retention rates of its alumni in four-year colleges are well above the norm, and a significant fraction of early participants are now in graduate programs in science or engineering. The program has surpassed all expectations in its effectiveness at engaging underserved populations in science and promoting entry into college, recruitment into STEM majors, and retention through undergraduate and into graduate studies. Hence, the project's overall goal will be to extend and adapt the research-immersive summer internship model through an alliance with peer research institutions, school districts and networks, public land and resource management agencies, private funding agencies, informal educational institutions, and experts in pedagogical modeling, metrics, and evaluation. Focused on earth and environmental sciences, the summer and year-round mentoring model will allow high school students to work in research teams led by college students and teachers under the direction of research scientists. The mentoring model will be multilayered, with peer, near-peer, and researcher-student relationships interweaving throughout the learning process. <br/><br/>The project has formulated a set of testable explanatory hypotheses: (1) Beyond specific subject knowledge, success rests on increased student engagement in a community of practice, with near-peer mentors, teachers, and scientists in the context of scientific research; (2) The intensity of engagement also shifts the students' vision of their future to include higher education, and specifically to imagine and move toward a STEM career; and (3) Early engagement, before students attend college, is critical because high school is where students form patterns of engagement and capacities related to science learning. Thus, the immediate goal of the two-year plan will be to create approximately 11 research internship programs focused on earth and environmental sciences, and to build the networks for growth through engagement with a wider community of educational partners. The main focus of this approach will be removing barriers between high school students and STEM organizations, and adapting the current mentoring model at Columbia University to the specific cultures of other research groups and internship programs throughout the lower Hudson Valley. The team has already assembled a diverse set of partners committed to broadening participation in STEM using a collective impact approach to early engagement in project-based learning. Research partners will provide the mentors, research projects, and laboratory facilities. The educational network partners will provide access for students, particularly those from under-resourced communities to participate, as well as participation opportunities for interested teachers. Informal learning organizations will provide access to field and research sites, along with research dissemination opportunities. In Year 1, the project will conduct a series of development workshops for partners already in place and foster the formation of new partnership clusters according to shared interest, complementary resources and geographic proximity. The workshops will provide a forum for partners to learn about each other's visions, values, challenges, and existing structures, while working through theoretical and practical issues related to STEM engagement for young investigators. In Year 2, the project will target the implementation of the internship programs at various sites according to the agreed-upon goals, program model, research projects, recruitment and retention strategy, staff training, data collection, and evaluation plans. An external evaluator will address both the formative and summative evaluation of the effort directed toward examining the three project?s hypotheses concerning the educational impacts of scientific research on student engagement, extent of the immersion, and overall effectiveness of the programs."

The long-term goal of this project is to establish bioinformatics as an essential component of undergraduate life sciences curricula nationwide. The field of bioinformatics, which uses techniques from computer science to store, manage, and analyze large biological data sets, has arisen to meet the challenges associated with such large data sets.  It is now an important interdisciplinary field that is central to studying many aspects of biology, yet it is not an integral part of most biology curricula nationwide.  The current project is informed by the results of the successful conference held by the PI team for their RCN-UBE Incubator project (DBI-134559).<br/><br/>In order to achieve full integration of bioinformatics into undergraduate life sciences education, NIBLSE is establishing a permanent network of investigators committed to this goal. The Leadership Team and Steering Committee are using the literature and their collective expertise to identify, vet, and refine a set of bioinformatics core competencies for inclusion in life sciences curricula.  They are also identifying and vetting assessment tools that align with the core competencies and that will facilitate educational research related to the integration of bioinformatics into biology curricula.  Finally, they are developing systems to organize and simplify dissemination of curricular materials, assessment tools, and professional development resources.  The materials and resources developed by the  network are having a broad impact on undergraduate education in the life sciences by enabling educators nationwide to effectively apply bioinformatics knowledge and skills to their teaching and research.

Such conditions pose an immediate security and conservation risk to NCMS fossil specimens, particularly to scientifically significant holdings that are deteriorating from pyrite disease. This project will rehouse the NCSM paleontological holdings into museum-grade steel cabinets with archival materials following best practices in specimen conservation. The project will also introduce underserved public school students to citizen science where they will improve open-access natural history specimen data via measurements and 3D models and will integrate deeply with multiple existing NCSM programmatic efforts including a youth science communication opportunity to document and broadcast the project in action to public school audiences. <br/><br/>Rehousing will greatly increase the security, value, and long-term research and educational viability of the NCSM Paleontological Collection, which includes significant holdings in Ediacaran invertebrates, Cretaceous - Cenozoic echinoids, and one of the most extensive collections of Late Triassic vertebrates from eastern North America. The Paleontological Collection is an active resource for research and education, including public university courses taught annually by museum staff either inside the museum's on-exhibition Paleontology Research Lab or in the collections area. These activities regularly engage graduate and undergraduate students, and museum visitors with specimen-based paleontological research. NCSM receives about 1 million visitors each year and is free to the public, engaging culturally and socio-economically diverse audiences. This project capitalizes on specimen rehousing to broadly impact existing NCSM programs as well as create new STEM opportunities targeted for pre-professionals at multiple levels (underserved 9-12, undergraduate, and graduate students). Initiatives include the launch of a new citizen science program - Junior Curator: Fossil Collections - designed to increase open-access morphological data from NCSM paleontological specimens and engage local underserved students. Other goals are aimed at garnering community engagement with natural history collections by broadcasting a behind-the-scenes peek at collections care via live, scientist-to-classroom connections within the North Carolina Public School System; new content creation via NCSM's digital media production program TeenTV; monthly presentations in the NCSM's free Daily Planet Theater; and established NCSM social media platforms (e.g., multiple blog sites, Twitter, and live expedition websites.) Planned professional deliverables include iDigBio webinars. Results can be viewed at (collections.naturalsciences.org). This project will also support NCSM's demonstrated commitment to increasing accessibility of the Paleontological Collection as an external research resource.

These collections serve as a foundation in plant science and science policy, especially those serving rural communities. In this setting, herbaria are especially important data sources because land managers require information on native and introduced species, as well as the effects of rapidly changing species assemblages. While serving the larger scientific community, regional herbaria also serve local residents, farmers, private and government policy makers, and land managers more specifically and thoroughly. It is therefore vital that herbaria accurately represent the past and present plant diversity. The Georgia Southern University (GSU) Herbarium holds 21,127 catalogued specimens and is housed in a state-of-the-art building. However, an estimated 26,500 vascular plant specimens (55.6% of the collection) are unorganized and in need of curation and integration to fulfill their scientific value and use. Most of this un-accessioned material comes from the Georgian Coastal Plain, a relatively poorly sampled region that harbors many rare and endangered species. This award will allow GSU to integrate two recently acquired orphaned collections and other backlogged specimens, doubling the GSU Herbarium's holdings and assure the security of an invaluable scientific collection for future generations. Through this project, these specimens will be mounted onto herbarium sheets and data about the collections will be digitized, which will improve and secure the collection for research and education over the long-term. Furthermore, the facility will be updated with the necessary tools to provide researchers and students access to the most comprehensive collection of plant diversity in the region through loans, visits, and online databases.<br/><br/>The GSU Herbarium has 21,127 accessioned specimens, but an estimated 26,500 specimens documenting the regional diversity of southeastern Georgian Coastal Plain, including rare species, collections from sparsely sampled areas, and the orphaned Youth Museum of Savannah Herbarium and the Flora of Fort Stewart, are inaccessible for research and education. This impedes efforts to integrate contemporary collections, reorganize the collection, integrate nomenclatural changes, and other educational outreach initiatives, generating an urgent need to process the backlogged collection. The project will integrate un-accessioned specimens into the main collection by transferring collection book information into label data. Specimens will be mounted and filed, and the label data uploaded into existing online database repositories to increase their dissemination and use. In addition, reorganization and nomenclatural updates will secure the collection for future use and facilitate access. The award will greatly enhance and secure a unique, historically significant collection that documents the exceptional plant diversity of the Coastal Plain. Active-learning modules will be created to engage high school and freshman college students, while integrating STEM education. The award will further allow the Herbarium to engage and train GSU's diverse student community by participating in a mentored learning environment and gain experience crucial to pursuing STEM careers by actively assisting in curatorial practices.

In more general applications, the increased amount of data obtained by the tags will provide valuable information to scientists and policymakers to help understand the complex properties and changes in the ocean and other aquatic environments, thus aiding conservation efforts. Important areas for study include estuarine environments, where rapid profiling can record dynamic conditions, and low and high salinity areas such as choked lagoons, coastal isolated lakes, and subglacial lakes. The data will enhance our ability to understand seasonal variations, changes caused by human populations and activities, and global climate change. This project will support three undergraduate student internships (one chemical engineer and two biologists). The project will also include a lesson plan on ocean salinity measurements for a local high school with a high percentage of underrepresented groups to increase interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education, and to encourage young students to consider multidisciplinary careers in engineering and the sciences with environmental conservation in mind. <br/><br/>Sensors in the innovative tags will measure water temperature, depth, and salinity (the amount of dissolved salts), which are interrelated indicators of ecosystem health. The data produced will be geo-referenced; that is, the tag will provide a location of the collected information. These tags will differ from current commercial devices by measuring salinity as a function of the optical properties of the water (the refractive index) by detecting and recording changes in the interaction of light with the sensor (patent pending). The major advantages of the optical measurement include fast operation, wide dynamic range, and cost effectiveness for the attainable resolution. The parameters collected by the tag will provide valuable information about the marine environment that can be correlated to locations where specific animals travel to satisfy their basic food and reproduction needs, and will provide insight into habitat changes linked to declining marine populations."

The rapid advance of sequencing technologies is one of the most important reasons behind the evolution of genomics research. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has significantly lowered the cost for sequencing DNA and RNA, has remarkably increased the application of genomics in every aspect of life sciences. More recently, we have seen the emergence of third-generation long-read Single-Molecule Sequencing (SMS) technologies from companies like PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. Unlike short (100-500 bp) NGS reads, the SMS reads have the distinguishing characteristics of long read length (2,000-50,000 bp), unbiased sequencing, a different type and frequency of random errors, and detection of additional modifications to the DNA bases, called epigenetic modification information. These characteristics make SMS reads useful in many genomics investigations, such as de novo genome assemblies (where there is no guiding framework available), methylation detection, gene isoform detection (small sequence changes that identify different alleles of a gene) and structural variation detection (large rearrangements in the organization of the genes). This project will develop efficient algorithms and tools to improve the effectiveness, usefulness and applicability domain of SMS reads. The successful completion of this project will significantly transform genomics research. The new tools will enable biologists to perform genomics studies, such as de novo assembly and global methylation detection, on large genomes using SMS. The tools will significantly lower the cost of analysis and increase the utility of the data for biologists so that they can advance their research. All algorithms, tools and demonstrations resulting from this project will be made publicly available to educators, researchers and students through our project website and GitHub. This project will be useful to train computer science students, including women and minority students, on bioinformatics problems and algorithm design.<br/><br/>Although SMS is now widely used in the genomics studies of small bacterial and archaeal genomes, the computational cost and high data volume currently prevent its use in the study of mid-to-large size genomes. The overall goal of this project is to develop fast algorithms and tools to investigate remedies for problems in three SMS applications: pairwise and reference alignment, error correction, and base modification detection. First, we will develop a tool for pairwise and reference genome alignments of SMS reads at least 5X faster than those currently available by designing and integrating fast k-mer matching, linear positional chaining and SIMD (Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data) based banded Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithms. Then, we will develop a linear space and linear time algorithm for reads alignment graph (RAG) based method, as well as a multiple reads alignment graph (MRAG) based method to efficiently correct processing for Oxford Nanopore technology data output. Furthermore, we will design an optimized and parallelized Spark pipeline for base modification detection using SMS reads, as well as a two-step classification method for effectively detecting base modification in SMS reads using neural networks. This research will substantially advance the state-of-the-art algorithms and tools for SMS reads.

Several scientifically valuable collections in the museum will be conserved, including specimens of Federally Endangered species, endemic Appalachian species, and critical pollinators.<br/><br/>Despite the continuous use and constant growth of this collection, the storage and curation methods are antiquated and it is currently located at a temporary storage facility.  This project will provide critical support to the collection and will accomplish the relocation of the collection to campus, improve the physical storage infrastructure for specimens, and address digitization, cataloguing, and documentation of specimens. Over the duration of this project, undergraduate and graduate students along with a new full-time collections manager will be trained in collections research, including curatorial best practices, digitization, and networking biodiversity data. Public outreach events will target the underserved Appalachian population. Science curriculum kits will be developed for elementary students, and old insect cabinets and drawers will be upcycled as mini-natural history collections and donated to local nature centers. An insect collection exhibit will be developed for the University's annual Bug Fest and Bug Camp for elementary school students. With a revitalized presence on campus and a greater capacity to engage the public with insects and science, the Virginia Tech Insect Collection represents a unique and powerful resource to translate the importance of biodiversity and science to the historically underserved Appalachian region.  All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public."

The study of evolutionary relationships helps researchers understand and respond to the origin and spread of viruses, develop strategies to preserve existing species, mitigate the impact of invasive species, and determine how environmental changes impact populations, shaping local and global ecologies. The information obtained from evolutionary research informs both agricultural and medical policies, two areas where the potential impact on national and global economies is substantial. At present, evolutionary research is critically dependent on the analysis of large amounts of DNA sequence data. Phylogenetic analyses and population genetics studies of sequence data are computationally intensive and are accomplished most efficiently through access to powerful high performance computing resources. This project will sustain the operation of the CIPRES Science Gateway, a premiere web service for analyzing sequence data that has provided 30,000+ researchers around the world with easy access to high&#8208;performance computers at no charge. CIPRES lets individual investigators and multi&#8208;national research teams analyze their data anywhere an internet connection is available, and it makes running the analyses as easy as possible for researchers with little knowledge of high&#8208;performance computing. Analyses run by CIPRES produce results 10&#8208;to&#8208;100&#8208;fold faster than is possible on a laptop computer. As a result, comprehensive studies can be completed more quickly, and large studies that are not practical on laptop computers can now be completed successfully. CIPRES thus dramatically improves researcher productivity and democratizes access to high&#8208;performance computing, allowing investigators to contribute to the growing understanding of evolution on earth, independent of their local resources. The impact of CIPRES on the rate of discovery has been substantial; it has supported more than 4,500 published research studies since 2010 and has been used by 90+ instructors in classroom environments. <br/> <br/>CIPRES currently supports 10,000+ researchers annually who are investigating the evolutionary history of proteins, viruses, bacteria, plants, and animals; identifying new genera and species; evaluating and developing new techniques; and exploring the evolutionary history of diverse populations. This project will sustain the continued online presence of CIPRES for these researchers through the following activities: provide browser and RESTful access to current versions of community phylogenetics and population genetics codes deployed on high&#8208;performance computing resources supported separately by the NSF XSEDE project; update the codes and/or usage policies to help users do more computationally demanding analyses; adapt the codes and policies to changes in available XSEDE resources and the local operating environment; modify the underlying software to support new code capabilities and correct any functionality or usability issues that arise; minimize negative impacts of planned and unplanned system outages on hundreds of simultaneous jobs; provide outreach by making presentations at professional meetings and hosting workshops to improve connection with the systematics community; monitor usage statistics to better understand and improve the effectiveness of CIPRES; and procure allocations of supercomputer resources to support the large CIPRES user community. The project will also sustain the CIPRES Workbench Framework, an open source software package that underlies CIPRES and that has been adopted by four other biology communities to create their own gateways. CIPRES can be accessed at http://www.phylo.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integration of these data, including fossil species, permits the reconstruction of the Tree of Life, which has been identified by Science magazine as one of the 125 top scientific challenges of the new millennium.  By documenting phenotypes for tree-building, researchers test major evolutionary hypotheses such as when did a species develop flowers? Or the ability to fly?  With tens of millions of species on the planet, organizing this informatino requires substantial creative computer infrastructure.  Such infrastructure has existed for genotypic information for some time, initiated in large part by the Human Genome Project in the 20th century.  Organizational tools and databases for phenotypes has not, however, received similar attention historically.  Thus in 2001, with support from the National Science Foundation, investigators initiated MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org/), an open-source Web application and database that has become a modern tool for collecting, organizing, storing and presenting data on phenotypes across the Tree of Life.  Because software must continuously change to function in the ever-evolving world of the Internet, this project is to sustain MorphoBank software and infrastructure such that the tool and database endures as a robust resource for the evolutionary biology community and the public.<br/><br/>MorphoBank gives scientists a unique digital workspace to collaborate - in real time - with others worldwide and to conduct data collection relevant to the Tree of Life and evolution.  Prior success of MorphoBank is underscored by key statistics. Each month scientists record >90,000 observations and load >2,000 newly-generated, curated and annotated images.  Over 2,000 visitors reach the site monthly to view projects >3,000 times, matrices >6,000 times, and media >75,000 times. 30% of published projects on MorphoBank are derived from separate NSF-funded geology, biology and anthropology grants.  Another >35% of projects hold the research output funded by scientific agencies internationally making MorphoBank a global destination as a tool and archive.  Scholarship that would have been impossible before MorphoBank includes the NSF-supported Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) project for mammals.  This research was published in Science and included  >12,000 images tied to hundreds of thousands of scientific observations by a team of over 20 researchers. The paper received wide press (New York Times, BBC, Time Magazine), including mention of MorphoBank as the research-enabling innovation. Morphobank represents a new element in the US scientific infrastructure, providing a model platform for location-independent global scientific collaboration.  Proposed contributions to education and training provided by the current project include: (1) a software course in Web-based bioinformatics for ethnic minority computer science majors from Stony Brook University, New York, (2) two summer internships for selected students from that course, and (3) two ""Morpholution"" courses at the American Museum of Natural History for high school students to learn scientific practices for studying phenotypes."

It is also a collection that is central to one of the most heavily subscribed graduate and undergraduate organismal biology education programs in the United States. This project will secure and make accessible the RWLC bird, mammal and parasite specimens in modern space-saving cabinetry within a new, centrally located campus collections center. This center will catalyze a campus-wide initiative that connects SUNY-ESF students from underrepresented groups, as ""Collections Ambassadors,"" to research, education, and leadership in environmental biology. A graduate student (Collections Assistant) will be trained in curatorial techniques and will make high-resolution images web-accessible in order to share them with Syracuse inner city high school students and ignite excitement about nature by viewing it up-close.  These collections and natural science educational connections will be important for students' career development. The public will be able to tour and view the collections through large windows onto the collections research space. <br/><br/>As our nation's biodiversity declines, societal need for natural history collections increases. However, the foundation for collections accessibility and future expansion is security. Many of RWLC vertebrate specimens date to the 1800s and early 1900s and current cabinetry is not much younger. Under present conditions, specimens are inaccessible due to overcrowding in inadequate and poorly sealing cabinets, pests, and lack of digitization. This project leverages a state award to finish a large climate-controlled space within an existing new building, which will house growing and heavily used collections and facilitate their digitization. The collections move will involve quantitative assessment, stabilization, and integrated pest management of specimens, as well as curation and data management training of Collections Ambassadors (undergraduate interns) and the Collections Assistant. As part of the reorganization, specimens will be re-arranged and digitized. The new drawers of digitized specimens and modern specimen arrangement will be the basis for collections-based research for generations of SUNY-ESF's emerging environmental leaders. Many of the RWLC's specimens are from New York's ""forever wild"" Adirondack Park, beloved by the RWLC's namesake President Theodore Roosevelt. Project results will be made available on the web (www.esf.edu/rwls/) and digitized specimen data will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org)."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience.

While advances in sequencing technology have made DNA sequencing routine in most laboratories, methods to infer evolutionary histories from large sequencing datasets have had to make restrictive or biologically unrealistic assumptions to achieve computational tractability.  This project will overcome the limitations of current methods by relaxing such restrictive assumptions and it will provide users with ways to assess the accuracy of estimates produced by the methods. This research will be integrated with an education plan that consists of multiple activities intended to introduce young women in high school to computer science and biology research: offering summer research experiences in the PI's lab, inviting high school students to collaborate with undergraduates in the PI's courses that teach programming skills to biology majors, and teaching programming to a variety of high school audiences.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to develop methods that accurately infer (1) changes in population size over time, (2) rates of migration between populations over time, and (3) genomic targets of natural selection --- all from sequence data alone, taken from multiple individuals within a single species. The methods developed will model recombination, produce measures of uncertainty for reported estimates, allow for complex population histories, and identify regions of the genome under selection. The methods developed in this project will also be applied to test hypotheses regarding the evolutionary histories of a range of organisms. Software produced and data analyzed in publications resulting from the research will be made available to the public on the lab's data repository (http://ramachandran-data.brown.edu/) and through R packages deposited on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/)."

Squid and jellies are critical components of many marine ecosystems that simultaneously support and pressure important commercial fisheries. Access to, and observations of, jellies and squid are particularly timely given climate-associated habitat modifications and range changes. The ITAG will provide information to address how the marine environment is changing and how key taxa are responding to these changes, supporting the needs of the scientific community, commercial fisheries, resource managers, and policy makers. This research will support the career development of young scientists. Undergraduate students will be directly involved in all aspects of the research and outreach. Results of this work will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community and the public through direct collaborations, workshops, tutorials, open-access data and tools, media releases, and already well-followed blogs. This project will leverage the Communication and Outreach Departments of multiple institutions and the public's inherent interest in jellies and squid to broaden the awareness of marine science and engineering through: (a) public presentations, (b) direct communication and interaction with journalists and teachers, and (c) education in local schools for preschool, grade-school and college students.<br/><br/>The purpose of the new ITAG (invertebrate tag) bio-sensor is to simultaneously record a suite of fine-scale behavioral and environmental data. Soft-bodied invertebrates such as such as jellies and squid are the most abundant and diverse animals in the ocean, the world's largest habitat. As keystone taxa, these soft-bodied invertebrates make up important global fisheries and are a vital link in the ocean food web, connecting top predators and smaller prey. However, we know surprisingly little about the linkages between the physical conditions of their environment and physiological and behavioral patterns of jellies and squid. This new technology will incorporate new physical sensors as well as animal-based orientation and acceleration measurements thereby proving a unique and inclusive bio-sensor. The ITAG will be constructed with a modular framework that will enable the flexibility required to apply the device across taxa. Once secured to the animal, the ITAG will provide vital data on animal associations with environmental features and responses to ocean acidification and warming. As such, tagged animals will become mobile sensing platforms capable of observing their surrounding environment. The tools and data developed for this award will be broadly applicable in both the research and conservation communities who face a paucity of information about these animals and the environments they inhabit. Leveraging key and abundant taxa provides an efficient means to circumvent the challenges and costs of traditional sampling and observing platforms, thus transforming our measurement capabilities, data resolution, breadth of application, and understanding of the ocean and its resources."

The technology rapidly evolves and generates datasets of an increasingly large complexity and size. This rapid evolution must be matched by an equally fast evolution of statistical methods and tools developed for analysis of these data. Ideally, new statistical methods should leverage the rich resources available from over 12,000 packages implemented in the R programming language and its Bioconductor project. However, technological limitations now hinder their adoption for mass spectrometric research. In response, the project ROCKET builds an enabling technology for working with large mass spectrometric datasets in R, and rapidly developing new algorithms, while benefiting from advancements in other areas of science. It also offers an opportunity of recruitment and retention of Native American students to work with R-based technology and research, and helps prepare them in a career in STEM.<br/><br/>Instead of implementing yet another data processing pipeline, ROCKET builds an enabling technology for extending the scalability of R, and streamlining manipulations of large files in complex formats. First, to address the diversity of the mass spectrometric community, ROCKET supports scaling down analyses (i.e., working with large data files on relatively inexpensive hardware without fully loading them into memory), as well as scaling up (i.e., executing a workflow on a cloud or on a multiprocessor). Second, ROCKET generates an efficient mixture of R and target code which is compiled in the background for the particular deployment platform. By ensuring compatibility with mass spectrometry-specific open data storage standards, supporting multiple hardware scenarios, and generating optimized code, ROCKET enables the development of general analytical methods. Therefore, ROCKET aims to democratize access to R-based data analysis for a broader community of life scientists, and create a blueprint for a new paradigm for R-based computing with large datasets.

Squid and jellies are critical components of many marine ecosystems that simultaneously support and pressure important commercial fisheries. Access to, and observations of, jellies and squid are particularly timely given climate-associated habitat modifications and range changes. The ITAG will provide information to address how the marine environment is changing and how key taxa are responding to these changes, supporting the needs of the scientific community, commercial fisheries, resource managers, and policy makers. This research will support the career development of young scientists. Undergraduate students will be directly involved in all aspects of the research and outreach. Results of this work will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community and the public through direct collaborations, workshops, tutorials, open-access data and tools, media releases, and already well-followed blogs. This project will leverage the Communication and Outreach Departments of multiple institutions and the public's inherent interest in jellies and squid to broaden the awareness of marine science and engineering through: (a) public presentations, (b) direct communication and interaction with journalists and teachers, and (c) education in local schools for preschool, grade-school and college students.<br/><br/>The purpose of the new ITAG (invertebrate tag) bio-sensor is to simultaneously record a suite of fine-scale behavioral and environmental data. Soft-bodied invertebrates such as such as jellies and squid are the most abundant and diverse animals in the ocean, the world's largest habitat. As keystone taxa, these soft-bodied invertebrates make up important global fisheries and are a vital link in the ocean food web, connecting top predators and smaller prey. However, we know surprisingly little about the linkages between the physical conditions of their environment and physiological and behavioral patterns of jellies and squid. This new technology will incorporate new physical sensors as well as animal-based orientation and acceleration measurements thereby proving a unique and inclusive bio-sensor. The ITAG will be constructed with a modular framework that will enable the flexibility required to apply the device across taxa. Once secured to the animal, the ITAG will provide vital data on animal associations with environmental features and responses to ocean acidification and warming. As such, tagged animals will become mobile sensing platforms capable of observing their surrounding environment. The tools and data developed for this award will be broadly applicable in both the research and conservation communities who face a paucity of information about these animals and the environments they inhabit. Leveraging key and abundant taxa provides an efficient means to circumvent the challenges and costs of traditional sampling and observing platforms, thus transforming our measurement capabilities, data resolution, breadth of application, and understanding of the ocean and its resources."

This research develops new analysis techniques that allow mass spectrometry data to be used in ways that are not currently possible, that may lead to advances in fields like medical diagnostics, drug development, and better understanding of poorly understood ailments involving proteins, such as Alzheimer's disease. A significant part of the research plan involves outreach to Seeley Swan High School in Montana, where researchers and teachers will team up to teach students problem-solving skills using  computers, in subjects such as chemistry, math, and biology. Students who have strong computational problem-solving abilities are more likely to attend college and more likely to apply for, and succeed in, professions requiring those skills, including scientific research.<br/><br/>Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a role in many investigations because it can quantify and identify the major components (proteins, lipids, metabolites) of almost any cellular system. MS data processing identifies the molecular composition of an MS sample by analyzing digital MS output signals. This research develops a fundamentally different approach to MS output signal analysis by: 1) Creating a fundamentally different paradigm for MS signal processing that probabilistically segments the entire MS output file instead of extracting subregions of interest, 2) Showing that current methods are insufficient through a quantitative evaluation, 3) Enabling future research by capturing currently excluded low abundance molecules, and 4) Demonstrating how this new paradigm broadens downstream experimental possibilities with a novel correspondence approach built on the additional information provided by the proposed segmentation techniques. Diversity will be fostered through continuing and expanding currently successful recruitment practices for lab participation. This research brings real research experience into collegiate and rural high school classrooms by 1) Stimulating discovery (particularly among underrepresented groups) through integrating computational mass spectrometry into the undergraduate and graduate computer science curriculum at the University of Montana. 2) Fostering problem-based STEM experience in rural high school students through integrating computational problem solving research into high school course materials.

Knowledge about the geographic occurrence of species is at the heart of much of ecology, evolution and conservation, and of tremendous societal importance. While digital species distribution products exist, they remain un-integrated and cannot serve critical societal needs. The Map of Life platform was developed to begin to solve this need. A key goal of this project is to use novel approaches to mobilize and integrate diverse types of data such that their collective strengths overcome individual weaknesses. Specifically, this project will combine, on a single website, a variety of distribution data types from many different sources, range products that integrate these, deductively and inductively modeled predictions, and reports about the spatial and environmental knowledgebase for species.  When completed, users from across a broad spectrum, from researchers with published data to citizen scientists, will be able to upload data, edit input or output and directly improve or comment on maps, iteratively leading to improved species distribution knowledge. Users will be able to directly query or download any redistributable content. Map of Life will thus facilitate a dramatically improved and rigorous accounting of the spatial context of species in science and will likely benefit scientists across the biological, environmental and social sciences.<br/><br/>Given that species range maps are one of the most commonly used and familiar information products in biology, the potential broader impacts and benefits of Map of Life to society are remarkable. Species distribution knowledge ties to one of the greatest challenges of our time: explaining the links between biodiversity, ecosystems and human health, and how ongoing global environmental changes are impacting our natural heritage and capital. Opportunity abounds for strong educational uses of the Map of Life infrastructure.  An exciting step will be the production of video tutorials covering how Map of Life works and how it can serve an important role in biodiversity knowledge creation, along with explaining core concepts about species ranges, biodiversity, and how to measure its change. Such videos are scalable means to reach large audiences and will be coordinated through the PIs and their institutional outreach programs.

Knowledge gained from analysis of Drosophila expression patterns is widely important, because a large number of genes involved in fruit fly development are commonly found in humans and other species. Thus, research efforts into the spatial and temporal characteristics of Drosophila gene expression images have been at the leading-edge of scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of different species development. Drosophila gene expression pattern images enable the integration of spatial expression patterns with other genomic datasets that link regulator with their downstream targets. This project addresses the computational challenges in analyzing Drosophila gene expression patterns by leveraging a new bioinformatics software system. It focuses on designing principled bioinformatics and computational biology algorithms and tools that will integrate multi-modal spatial patterns of gene expression for Drosophila embryos' developmental stage recognition and anatomical ontology term annotation, and will infer gene interaction networks to generate a more comprehensive picture of gene function and interaction. The bioinformatics methods resulting from the project activities are broadly applicable to a variety of fields such as biomedical science and engineering, systems biology, clinical pathology, oncology, and pharmaceutics. Novel tools to enhance courses and research experiences for diverse populations of students are planned to broaden participation in science. <br/><br/>This project investigates three challenging problems for studying the Drosophila embryo ISH Images via innovative bioinformatics algorithms: 1) the sparse multi-dimensional feature learning method to integrate the multimodal spatial gene expression patterns for annotating Drosophila ISH images, 2) the heterogeneous multi-task learning models using the high-order relational graph to jointly recognize the developmental stages and annotate anatomical ontology terms, 3) the embedded sparse representation algorithm to infer the gene interaction network. It is innovative to apply structured sparse learning, multi-task learning, and high-order relational graph models to Drosophila gene expression patterns analysis and holds great promise for scientific investigations into the fundamental principles of animal development. The algorithms and tools as outcomes of this research are expected to help knowledge discovery for applications in broader scientific and biological domains with massive high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets. This project facilitates the development of novel educational tools to enhance several current courses at University of Texas at Arlington. The PIs engage minority students and under-served populations in research activities to provide opportunities for exposure to cutting-edge scientific research.

The Southeast Region of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (SERP) will host a professional development institute on the campus of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University in summer 2019, with a follow-up event hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists in spring 2020. The Institute will engage sixteen teams in a virtuous cycle of assessment and reforms based on the recommendations in ""Vision and Change."" Teams will include representatives from all institution types, from community colleges to research-intensive universities, as well as significant representation of Minority Serving Institutions. Institutional teams will be comprised of both faculty and administrators to ensure representation of both grassroots and institutional stakeholders.<br/><br/>The project has two primary objectives: (1) to develop a network of life sciences departments engaged in a cycle of continual improvement; and (2) to conduct an evidence-based assessment of a systems model for undergraduate life sciences reform. The Institute will employ a strategy of shared-visioning, which requires substantial communication, learning, and collaboration among all stakeholders. The agenda is designed to help teams build a common language to enable discussion of important issues (e.g., course-embedded research, metacognition, etc.), identify shared priorities for improvement at the level of faculty, department, and institution, and draft an action plan for short-term and long-term reform efforts. By focusing on department-level transformation, the project builds capacity for long-term systemic changes to educational practice and improved student learning. Because public dissemination and formative assessment of these efforts are critical to validating team efforts and as providing accountability for institutional teams, a follow-up event will be held in conjunction with the 2020 meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists. All teams will make a public poster presentation of their action plan, efforts to date, and initial assessment results. A separate workshop during the ASB meeting will be used to collect more detailed assessment data from each team, as well as provide time for inter-team sharing of successes and challenges. Finally, a public workshop will be conducted to introduce the general ASB membership to the recommendations of ""Vision and Change.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This PEN will digitize about 40,000 marine invertebrate specimens and will contribute data on fossils from boreholes drilled by private industry, bulk specimens from Pleistocene marine terraces, specimens representing the northern extent of the Bay of California, and type specimens of fossils from across Southern California.  Throughout the course of the project, undergraduate students will be heavily involved. They will be given training and experience in museum studies earlier in their academic careers than is typical, giving them a boost for future career development opportunities. Many of the students that will be involved are from groups underrepresented in museum sciences.  Since the majority of UCR's student body are low-income and/or from underrepresented minorities, paid internships will be provided through this project to provide an avenue for some who would otherwise be unable to enter the field.  The UCRESM includes an exhibit hallway visited by about 25,000 people per year, including many of the university's tour groups.

Bulk specimens from Pleistocene marine terraces provides a less biased look at the diversity of a site than targeted collections.  Specimens from the Bay of California, which once extended far north of the Salton Sea and its fauna had an unexpected affinity with the Caribbean, are important for studying the dispersal of taxa between the Atlantic and Pacific just before the closure of the Panamanian Isthmus.  Best practice protocols for digitizing core data created during this project will be uploaded to EPICC's website for other core collections to consult.

Collections are especially important in predicting biodiversity change with shifts in climate and land use. The Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) houses more than 1.2 million specimens and is heavily utilized for research, education, and public outreach. From multiple sources, the Herbarium acquired 30,000 plant specimens collected by ten significant 20th century botanists. 70% of these were collected from 15 of 34 designated world biodiversity hotspots; 30% represents the California Floristic Province biodiversity hotspot. These specimens are in critical need of curation owing to poor storage conditions. Several specimens have been identified as critical for describing and naming species new to science. Curation of these collections will provide physical access to collections currently unavailable for study, promote discovery of species new to science, and yield new distribution and phenology data. Importantly, curation will ensure critically needed preservation. Digitization efforts will provide access of this rich source of specimen data to researchers, students, and the public. Integral to the project are activities involving the participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. Notably, RSABG will expand on a successful undergraduate internship program by engaging underserved youth from the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Especially targeted are at-risk and transitional aged youth at the high school level, who will be trained in a six-week summer junior intern program. All interns will participate in five workshops that will serve to connect students to collections, natural history, and biodiversity. An exhibit at RSABG will highlight the activities and student participation in the project.<br/><br/>As herbaria serve expanding needs for research, education, and conservation management, it is critical that collections of historic, taxonomic, and geographic significance are curated and digitized, ensuring their availability for research through investments in their long-term security. Through various sources, the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden acquired 30,000 vascular plant specimens of historic, taxonomic, and geographic importance representing the collections of ten significant botanists of the 20th century. These specimens are in danger of deterioration, owing to unsatisfactory past and current storage conditions (e.g., non-archival newspapers). Thus, these collections are in critical need of curation and improved storage to secure them for posterity. Several specimens have been identified as type material that was thought to have been lost. The principal objective of this three-year project is to curate and digitize these specimens through student participation. A large cadre of students at different levels in their academic career will participate in all aspects of the project, including specimen preparation, databasing, imaging, and georeferencing. Specimen data will become available for more than 18,000 species of vascular plants in ~350 families. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio, GBIF, the Consortium of California Herbaria, and the RSABG Herbarium web portal.

This attrition is a significant problem because there are not enough science, health professionals, and teachers in the U.S., and more diverse perspectives are needed to help solve the world's complex scientific challenges. Part of the reason for this attrition is because science education can seem abstract and not relevant to the problems that students are aware of in their own communities. This project addresses this attrition by creating a network focused on urban agriculture. Urban agriculture engages undergraduate students, in part, because it connects two of the world's most pressing problems, how to make agriculture more sustainable, and how to make cities healthier. Urban agriculture sites such as campus gardens and community farms, filled with crop plants, flowers, and insects, can captivate the imagination and connect them to nature. Although underappreciated, urban agriculture is also an ideal setting for helping students learn about science because plots of crop plants can easily organized as experiments. This project will build on this feature to develop labs that help undergraduate students learn every aspect of the scientific process, coming up with questions, developing a project design, collecting data, analyzing results, and presenting findings. This project will also make important contributions to communities by helping students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, stay interested in biology, and by connecting science education to community service projects such as produce donation programs. <br/><br/>Undergraduate attrition from science fields is a significant problem in the United States. Attrition from science fields contributes to a shortage of available science and health professionals and teachers, and represents lost investments for students. Science attrition is particularly pronounced in underrepresented groups, which are needed to diversify perspectives. Reducing this attrition requires the development of rigorous yet engaging programs accessible to a large number of students from all backgrounds. This project will create a research coordination network that enhances undergraduate biology education by capitalizing on the advantages of urban agriculture as a model system. The network will be guided by two core goals: 1) to develop and implement biology curricula using the Core Concepts and Competencies outlined by the AAAS in their 2011 report, Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education; and 2) to create quantitative assessments that measure progress toward our curricular and network goals. Urban agriculture provides an ideal setting for this program because the topic is relevant to students and the venue provides opportunities for hands-on training around core concepts in biology. The project will also help students connect their science training to community service through produce distributions, educational programming, and other types of outreach activities with community partners. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellow, Janet Buckner, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Tracy Heath (Iowa State University) and Courtney Hofman (University of Oklahoma). The goal of the fellow's research is to reveal the relationships among the nearly 180 species of living waterfowl (ducks, geese and swans) by sequencing and comparing their DNA. Human-waterfowl interactions (i.e., hunting, domestication) have garnered much interest in the conservation of these species and their habitats, which provide important ecosystem services. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of waterfowl biology and their role in wetland ecosystems would aid the conservation and management efforts of biologists and lay people. Additionally, their diverse behaviors, physical characteristics, and global distribution make waterfowl a promising model group for understanding animal evolution. The fellow is working to improve methods for estimating the rate of origination and extinction in this bird group by including fossil DNA in the genetic comparison. Such improved methods have the potential to improve the overall understanding of how evolution occurs over time and to identify particularly vulnerable species by directly measuring recent rates of extinction. Finally, the fellow is building online platforms dedicated to mentoring, promotion and inclusion of underrepresented students and professionals in the biological sciences. This initiative is vital to science and society because it allows for the recognition and fostering of promising biologists from minority groups that might otherwise be overlooked due to a lack of opportunity, support and/or information.<br/><br/>This research is extending the statistical framework of recent phylogenetic methods to produce improved estimates of extinction rates from molecular phylogenies. The fellow is (1) producing the most robust, taxonomically complete phylogeny of waterfowl using morphological and molecular data in a total-evidence dating approach; (2) extracting DNA from up to 30 species of recently extinct waterfowl available from museum collections, and (3) restructuring the fossilized birth-death model developed by sponsoring scientist Heath, to deal with newly incorporated fossil molecular sequence data. The fellow is being trained in the development of phylogenetic methods and statistical models under Bayesian inference and in the most recent ancient DNA sequencing protocols and technologies. The fellow is also actively engaged in outreach programs at the host institutions (e.g. SACNAS), particularly engaging undergraduate students in the research and networking initiatives described above."

Specimens in natural history collections are of practical importance as well, providing data on human disease and informing forensic science. This award funds the rehousing of an unparalleled natural history collection in new specimen cases. Currently the collection, one of the largest documenting the birds of North America, is under threat of degradation due to antiquated cases that no longer protect against pests and adverse environmental factors. Additionally, this award supports the gathering and dissemination of open-access data on the location of bird specimens. Digital images of specimens from under-studied avian groups will be made available through a new web portal that will engage scientists and the public alike. The location of the world's largest collection of Mexican birds, at a small liberal arts college in the United States, provides opportunities to train undergraduates, who are the next generation of museum scientists, in curation techniques as well as in the application of specimen data to address biological questions.<br/><br/>This project seeks to secure, georeference, and digitize the world's largest Mexican bird collection (63,000 specimens), located at the Moore Laboratory of Zoology (MLZ) at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California. Not only does the MLZ collection provide a window into Mexico's endemic bird diversity prior to a major period of development and deforestation, but also, for many widespread species that occur in the United States. The specimens housed at MLZ fill a large, critical gap linking bird populations of the entire North American continent. This project is urgent because new specimen cases are needed to replace antiquated cases that no longer prevent insect infestations and would not be able to protect against accidental flooding. In addition to new cases, the proposed activities include a major update to the taxonomy and organization of the collection, to facilitate the collection's research potential. A major goal of this project is to georeference, digitize and image the collection and make these data accessible as online resources to inform research and education. The MLZ's mission is to leverage our unique setting at a small liberal arts college toward: (i) Conducting cutting-edge research using natural history collections; (ii) promoting the use of natural history collections in undergraduate education and research; and (iii) promoting career development for underrepresented groups and women in museum science.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Natasha I. Bloch is ""Evolution of color vision genes in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) relative to male color: a window into the genetics of mate choice."" The host institutions for this fellowship are the University College London (London, UK) and the University of Illinois, and the sponsoring scientist Prof. Judith Mank and Prof. Rebecca Fuller.  The fellowship is funded jointly with the Office of International Science and Engineering. Forming international collaborations is not only beneficial to the young scientist who conducts research at the foreign location but is also in the U.S. national interest because that experience in a world-class research organization exposes the next generation of science leaders to the best the host country has to offer in terms of state-of-the-art research and the promises of continuing collaborations that will continue to strengthen U.S. science in the future. <br/> <br/>The spectacular colors displayed by males during courtship are known to play a role in mate choice by females. Female visual perception therefore may play a critical role in the evolution of male colors. In guppies, male color has evolved multiple times apparently as a trade-off between female preference and predation pressures. Populations under low-predation regimes have repeatedly and independently evolved more colorful males, and females with relatively strong preferences for color. To shed light into the evolutionary relationship between male color and female preferences, the fellowship research uses an integrative approach to study variation in opsins, the visual pigments that mediate vision, asking whether it mirrors the pattern of repeated evolution of male color traits. Next-generation sequencing is being used to evaluate the total number of opsin genes and their genomic position to assess variation in opsin sequence and expression associated with the evolution of colorful populations. To study divergence in the visual system beyond opsins, genes that are actually being expressed are being compared in the retina and the brain's optic lobes. Behavioral experiments are being conducted to determine guppies' sensitivity to color.  These last experiments are aimed at linking initial discoveries at the genetic level to their ultimate consequences on guppies' vision and behavior. The results of this research promise a cohesive, integrative and multi-faceted understanding of the role of opsin variation in this a model system of evolution and mate selection.<br/>  <br/>Training goals include extensive training in bioinformatics, particularly applied to the processing and analysis of genomic data, as well as the design and setup of behavioral experiments to study color vision.  Educational outreach to students through existing programs that serve under-represented groups are promoting science education and encouraging young students to pursue careers in science and the participation of minority students in biology."

These enzymes, called the carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), are found in all living organisms and particularly in plants and plant-associated microbes. The complex carbohydrates found in plant cell walls are the most abundant, and renewable, organic material on Earth. If we had efficient systems to convert them to biomaterials and biofuels they would be attractive targets for bio-manufacturing projects. Important effects in the natural world are (i) the CAZymes produced by plant microbial pathogens cause plant cell wall breakdown leading to devastating crop loss ($5 billion in the United States and Canada each year) and (ii) bacteria in animal guts produce hundreds of CAZymes that digest the carbohydrates in the diet, some of which may have positive, and others toxic, consequences to the host. The research approach combines genomics and bioinformatics: the genome of a green algae will be sequenced and then bioinformatics tools will be used to carry out data analysis. This green algae is the common ancestor of all land plants, its genome compared to those of plants will show how evolution has modified core carbohydrate chemistry to meet changing environmental challenges. Bioengineering of these enzymes may well contribute to the development of a more sustainable and secure bioeconomy (e.g., bioenergy and agricultural industries) in the US, as part of the global Genomics market, whose value is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020. Students trained in the course of this project will be poised to become the next generation of scientists, able to exploit their understanding of comparative genome sequence analysis to create new understanding and novel applications. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are to engage students as active participants in the research activities, including data analysis, and to to train undergraduate students and K-12 Science teachers to understand the basics of genome sequencing and comparison methods, including hands-on skills. <br/><br/><br/>In the first Aim, new bioinformatics programs will be developed to allow in-depth CAZyme annotation with predicted biochemical activities. In the second Aim, the genomic context of CAZymes will be studied in microbial genomes and metagenomes of various ecological environments. Overall four computational tools will be developed, integrated, and delivered as a CAZyme bioinformatics web portal named dbCAN2. These free online tools will facilitate CAZyme research in various research fields such as genomics, carbohydrate, bioenergy, plant disease, food security, human gut microbiome, evolution and ecology. In the third Aim, this project will sequence and mine the genomes and transcriptomes of algae and early plants for CAZymes. This includes sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a green alga Zygnema circumcarinatum, the immediate ancestor of all land plants that is extremely critical for understanding the early evolution of carbohydrate-rich cell walls. The specific education activities include: (i) working with the Office of Student Engagement and Experiential Learning (OSEEL) of Northern Illinois University to bring undergraduate students, particularly under-represented minority students, into CAZyme bioinformatics research; (ii) collaborating with the Center for Secondary Science Teacher Education of NIU to integrate DNA sequencing and data analysis topics into the curriculum of the Teacher Licensure Program as well as the professional development programs for K-12 Science teachers; and (iii) incorporating Zygnema genome annotation as new lab components into BIOS308 (Genetics) and BIOS441 (Practical Bioinformatics).

The network will empower faculty to engage students in the concepts, skills, and experimental thinking that not only increases student scientific literacy and problem-solving abilities but also allows them to contribute to science and society right now through the deeper second-pass annotation of large numbers of genes in microbial genomes and experimental testing of predicted gene function.<br/><br/>Network training workshops will be based on a geographic node model wherein groups of nearby participants agree on a common meeting site and time, and then one or more trainers travel to that site to run a weekend workshop. Each workshop will focus on either (a) gene annotation (genomics and bioinformatics) and functional prediction or (b) experimental testing of gene function (functional genomics). Training in gene annotation will be broken down into several modules such as sequence similarity searches and prediction of protein localization, and will involve appropriate freely available bioinformatics tools. The use of a freely available Web platform for re-annotation of genomes from Bacteria and Archaea (GENI-ACT) allows for users to easily construct, assign, and manage gene annotations across a large number of students in multiple courses. Virtual lab notebooks for each gene annotation allow individual or collaborative work in collecting and analyzing data. The platform capability includes students combining their own bioinformatics analyses with data from the research literature and their own functional genomics efforts to reach conclusions and make the data available for the larger research community and public. Workshops on functional genomics will focus on how to bring together well-known (e.g., transposon mutagenesis, PCR) and more specialized lab strategies (e.g., site-directed mutagenesis, protein overexpression) within the context of laboratory courses to test the predicted function of genes. Participants will be encouraged to brainstorm with trainers and other participants on appropriate strategies for non-model bacterial strains and genes of interest to them.

Analysis of biological processes within intact organs and/or living organisms is fundamental to understanding development and aging. The process of acquiring three-dimensional and/or time-lapse data in vivo has traditionally been hampered by technical difficulties that can be overcome, in large part, by using light-sheet microscopy. This award will facilitate cutting edge research and promote collaboration between researchers at the University of Maine, Maine Medical Research Center Institute, The Jackson Laboratories, and Mount Desert Island Biological Station. In order to increase the impact of this microscope on undergraduate education, a new CURE (course-based undergraduate research experience) entitled: ""Discovery in development, disease, and aging using light-sheet microscopy"" will be created.  This course will allow students to develop their own research projects and will include training in imaging, data analysis, ethics, scientific writing, and public speaking. This award will contribute to education of K-12 students by incorporating data obtained with the light-sheet microscope into middle and high school science classes. These datasets will also be shown at Science Cafes throughout the state and at the Maine State Science Festival.<br/><br/>This award will promote faculty research programs and training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students.  The research programs impacted pertain to: (1) muscle and neuromuscular development and disease, (2) mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in vivo, (3) three-dimensional characterization of progenitor cell renewal in the developing kidney, (4) development and implementation of image analysis algorithms, and (5) three-dimensional imaging of neural innervation in whole-adipose depots, among others. A common barrier to the above research projects is the limitation of current resources with regards to time-lapse and/or three-dimensional characterization of cellular processes underlying development and physiology. The increased speed of imaging, tiling function, spectral capabilities, and imaging depth of the light-sheet microscope will revolutionize the type and scale of research questions that can be addressed. The outcome of these research projects will be novel insight into basic biology and disease processes. In addition, new image analysis algorithms will be implemented and adapted to open-source, user-friendly platforms. In summary, a light-sheet microscope will transform Maine research programs and provide a very high scientific return-on-investment in the form of student training and publications. In addition, faculty on this grant will engage multiple demographic sectors in scientific literacy and inquiry. Thus, the Leica TCS SP8 DLS will enhance and expand the University of Maine's mission of education, research, and outreach."

Researchers using HT techniques will learn at the workshops from experts in academia and industry. This collaboration will empower faculty to develop and implement case HT studies in undergraduate education and promote applied quantitative skills including descriptive statistics and use of online 'big data' databases and tools. The network will disseminate these case studies broadly and work with other RCN-UBE programs to integrate the resources created in STEM courses and curricula across the country and world.<br/><br/>The network team will use a series of workshop meetings to bring together the STEM education community, with a focus on faculty from diverse institutions and researchers using or learning HT approaches. The workshops will foster the exchange of ideas and increase awareness of the importance of HT techniques in scientific research and the STEM education community. This research and educational network includes primarily undergraduate institutions, early career teaching faculty, and national and international researchers to create impactful educational materials to demonstrate the transformative power of HT approaches and teach underlying quantitative skills. The resulting inquiry-based case studies will engage students in authentic research and better train future scientists and engineers for jobs in modern molecular biology. Undergraduate students will analyze novel data sets and develop quantitative skills, while network participants will enhance their research and teaching through provided HT technical workshops and the development of case studies with teams of network-trained faculty and postdoctoral ""Case Fellows"". This project provides training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators.

Biologists rely on computational methods to analyze and integrate large data sets, while several computational methods were inspired by the high-level design principles of biological systems. Several common aspects and goals of computational and biological systems suggest that we can use one as a source for studies of the other and vice versa. With recent advances in our ability to generate and analyze biological data it is now possible, for the first time, to design new, bi-directional studies that directly link biology and computer science. This form of coupled experimental and computational thinking, which will be utilized in this project, can greatly benefit both biology and computer science. The proposal also seeks to help establish the usefulness of this approach to increase public interest in science and engineering and to provide interdisciplinary educational and research experiences for a diverse population of students.<br/><br/>This joint experimental-computational project will use a bi-directional approach to study the design, communication and coordination of networks utilized by Escherichia coli. The overall goal is to determine how biological systems utilize distributed networks over different scales, environments and varying communication strategies. The project will address biological questions ranging from how information processing is performed in signaling networks to the importance of various topological features of E. coli networks to coordination in a population of bacterial cells. In addition to addressing the biological questions these studies seek to provide insights into the design and usage of networks for distributed computational systems that can tolerate harsh environments, failures and limited resources making them applicable to a wide range of real world applications. Distributed networks are utilized by species ranging from single cell organisms to mammals. The proposal seeks to determine shared principles regarding the design and usage of such networks in E. coli. and the findings can be applied to understand similar systems in other species, as well. Beyond the immediate impact of the biological modeling and the algorithms developed, the synergy between computational and biological systems is of great interest to computer scientists, biologists and the general public.  The proposal includes an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, engineers and biologists. Students funded as part of this project will spend time at collaborators' labs from other disciplines leading to interdisciplinary training and the research will support and provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. The PI and co-PIs plan to develop and offer a new class on biologically inspired computational methods and to organize workshops and tutorials in relevant international meetings about the topic of this proposal.  Project outcomes will be disseminated at http://www.algorithmsinnature.org."

They will validate the methods using simulated neuronal networks, and apply them to recordings from the mouse brain. The team will also develop and test their approach using modern deep neural networks (convolutional nets and recurrent architectures) that achieve or exceed human performance in many hard tasks. This will allow them to quantify how interactions in these artificial networks change with the stimulus, and compare and contrast the results with data from animals. This is a broad set of goals that requires a combination of approaches and diverse expertise. The team therefore consists of experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, mathematicians, and statisticians who will work together closely. The true test of this work will be the impact it will have on brain science in general. The team is therefore committed to sharing their techniques, code and data.

This research will build a new computational framework to combine all of the genomic variants and simulate the resulting metabolic phenotypes. This framework will be broadly applicable, so it can analyze any group of organisms, and will include good documentation for the user-friendly interface, designed to be immediately accessible instead of requiring extensive training. The project will develop an online game based on the research framework and data that will be used to educate students and interested members of the public about the basic concepts of metabolic activities and metabolic evolution. Graduate students who have developed applications in the advanced framework will advise undergraduate students, who will be recruited from the University of Rhode Island's Seed of Success (SOS) program for summer internships, and who will develop and test the game interfaces. Finally, the educational game will be used during the two-day Engineering Challenges in the Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) Program to provide an interactive learning experience for high-school students.

Despite the reconstruction of over 100 GEMs in public literature, significant challenge remains in integrating the heterogeneous information about genes, proteins, reactions and metabolites into a comprehensive understanding of the associations between genome diversity and metabolic plasticity. To solve this problem, this research will focus on constructing a new computational infrastructure that combines the simulation of GEMs with the analysis of pan-genomes (i.e. an ensemble of genomes from any given group of organisms). The computational infrastructure will include a user-friendly interface that supports the collaborative construction, annotation, and quality checking of metabolic models. It will also enable the identification of genome-wide metabolic variations by providing new algorithms for GEM comparison and pan-genome analysis. Specifically, this project will focus on achieving three aims: (1) implement a new data format that will integrate heterogeneous information into the construction of metabolic models; (2) build a computational tool that will support the comparative analysis of metabolic networks; (3) develop a new algorithm that will improve the efficiency of ortholog mapping in pan-genome analysis and permit the comparison of metabolic variants among different organisms.

Genomics has qualitatively improved our ability to investigate biological dynamics and to make important discoveries that are the foundations for understanding topics such as environmental change, developing and protecting crops, and improving health outcomes. Genome analysis, however, can be a significant challenge for the practicing biologist. Many biologists who need to undertake genome science are not sufficiently expert in the relevant analytical tools, or the complex workflows required to get from the initial data generated by sequencers to a biologically-meaningful analyzed result. In addition, many do not have access to the advanced computing and large-scale storage resources required for processing and managing genomics data. The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) addresses these challenges by providing an integrated service comprised of expert bioinformatics consulting and educational services, hardened and optimized software available through easy-to-use web-based workflow management tools, advanced computing systems, and large scale data storage and publishing facilities. NCGAS services are particularly important in enabling important contributions from researchers from smaller institutions and other groups with limited access to their own resources.<br/><br/>NCGAS works through the following goals to fulfill its mission to enable the biological research community of the US to analyze, understand, and make use of the vast amount of genomic information now available:  provide excellent bioinformatics consulting services to biologists doing research in the areas of transcriptome- and genome-level assembly; deliver genome assembly and analysis software on national cyberinfrastructure (CI) systems and provide tools for download and installation on campus CI resources; provide training, education, and outreach programs on genome analysis; improve the quality and functionality of bioinformatics software; enable the use of large-memory compute clusters designed specifically to support genome analysis; and provide mechanisms to store and distribute genome research data and products. These efforts will enable and accelerate scientific discoveries by researchers who make use of NCGAS services, lower barriers for scientists to create, execute, document, and share genomics analyses, help identify best-in-class genomics analysis software and provide improved versions of these software to the community, enhance the technology literacy of practicing scientists, and help grow the bioinformatics workforce.

It is also a dynamic process: the phosphorylation status of proteins constantly rewires in different organisms, tissues, cell lineages, and in the same cell but under different conditions. While experimental approaches such as phosphoproteomics have greatly advanced the study of such dynamics, we have only recently begun to construct computational models to estimate the phosphorylation status of proteins under unseen perturbations. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient method for predicting protein phosphorylation dynamics, and to establish an on-line service system for researchers to upload their own data and predict new dynamics under unseen perturbations. The research will implement an on-line tool, which will have wide applications from prokaryotes to higher, complex organisms, under a variety of conditions. Local high-school students will be recruited to participate in the project, which may spin off for them to compete in national and international science project competitions.<br/><br/>Current models for reconstructing phosphorylation relationships between proteins using time-course data mainly rely on searching the large space of possible network structures, a process that is time-consuming and not directly applicable to predicting responses under unseen interventions. This research will investigate a fundamental solution, truncated singular value decomposition with graph partitioning, to estimate phosphorylation levels given new perturbations. This method will be orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than contemporary methods. These algorithms will be tested using in silico simulation as well as phosphoproteomics data. The research will implement an on-line tool, which will allow biology users from diverse research domains to upload their time-course phosphoproteomic data, retrieve the reconstructed phosphorylation relationships specific to their organism and cell type, and predict the phosphorylation levels under unseen perturbations.

To address this goal it is of critical importance to understand as much as possible about the functions of the tens of thousands of genes present in each plant species, in order to select those functions of most relevance to engineering favorable traits such as drought tolerance or increased grain quality.  Much of what is currently known about plant gene function comes from experiments in model plant systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana, but because of evolutionary relatedness this information can be used to predict the functions of genes in crop species such as maize and rice, and to provide targeted hypotheses that can be followed up by further experiments.  This project will increase both the efficiency and accuracy of gene function prediction in plants by organizing and integrating high quality data from a number of sources and presenting it in a user-friendly format that makes clear the evolutionary relationships between genes.  The team will develop software for visualizing the evolutionary relationships as a gene family tree, providing an organizing framework for disparate experimental observations from a number of experimental systems.  The project will provide software for use, and for data sharing, by a broad community of both researchers and students.  The project?s inclusion of local community college students will provide training and increase participation in computer science, genomics and plant biology by groups that are underrepresented in these fields.<br/><br/>The project output will be a powerful and intuitive software tool for inferring plant gene function from phylogenetic relationships and experimental evidence.  To achieve this goal the project aims are to: 1) assemble sets of phylogenetic trees using selected model organism and plant genomes, along with a suite of web services to ensure easy access to the data; 2) follow user-driven design principles to design and build the user interface, in order to visualize the phylogenetic trees and associate the genes within each tree with high quality functional information including Gene Ontology annotations, gene expression patterns, protein domains, sequence variations and mutant phenotypes; 3) provide an analysis platform that streamlines workflows and includes personal workspaces for users to add their own data and make it public when their work is completed, thus enriching the knowledgebase; and 4) produce workshops, course materials and online content to train scientists at all academic levels on how to use the software.

DGR is a world-class repository for frozen biological materials representing >200,000 organisms that are digitized and fully searchable on-line. Over 84% are associated with traditional voucher specimens. Dating back to 1979, DGR is the largest wild mammal collection worldwide, and among the top 10 largest bird tissue collections. The facility also houses substantial fish, amphibian and reptile tissues including critical samples from endangered species and threatened ecosystems. DGR is worldwide in scope with excellent representation from North America, Asia, Africa, and throughout Latin America. These specimens provide critical resources for studies of specialized and interdisciplinary studies. Annually > 50 loans of approximately 2000 specimens generate >80 peer-reviewed publications. DGR has held a leadership role in developing connections between the museum community and the molecular genomic efforts. This upgrade to DGR provides a platform to further those efforts, and also leverages the heavy involvement of DGR with municipal, state, and federal agencies, especially in the fields of natural resource management and public and wildlife health. Planned outreach utilizes existing programs at the museum to educate the public, including young students, on the role of collections in the practice of science that benefits society.<br/><br/>This project will create a state-of-the-art facility by replacing the existing electrical (-80C) freezer system with 3 large liquid nitrogen freezers and a nitrogen generator that will significantly increase sample quality by providing much lower archival temperatures (-190C) and much longer protection should there be a catastrophic interruption of power or other emergency. In addition this upgrade will reduce electrical consumption substantially (>60% reduction). All samples to be moved will receive unique barcodes to enable the transfer of associated specimen data into a digital object tracking system and to informatics applications. The associated database, Arctos, has direct links to GenBank (and soon IsoBank) that immediately tie the specimen and associated museum data (spatial, temporal, morphological) to other Big Data on the web. This connection places the museum specimen as the primary nexus that connects not only the publications derived from specimen-based research, but also the increasingly vast amounts of new molecular data derived from each specimen."

This project will provide training for over 20 undergraduate students, and one graduate student.  These students will participate in a research experience activity to visit the UTEP Indio Mountains Research Station to follow and understand the process of collection data capture from field to collection to public accessibility through SCAN, by observing ants and other ground-dwelling arthropods in the field, uploading photos to iNaturalist (with research-grade identifications), and by collecting specimens and associated data.  These students and another cadre of UTEP art students will also collaborate on a public museum exhibit about Ants of the New World.  The majority of the exhibits will feature highly accurate 3D printer models (about 30 cm long) of actual ant specimens from the collections.  <br/><br/>In this project, the UTEP-BC aims to join the SCAN project via Northern Arizona University.  The primary goal of SCAN is to form a digital and virtual network of disparate collections in the southwestern US, which can be captured by the iDigBio infrastructure for large-scale biodiversity science analyses. The SCAN network has prioritized five arthropod groups:  ants (Formicidae), ground beetles (Carabidae), grasshoppers (Acrididae), darkling beetles (Tenebrionidae), and spiders (Araneae).   The UTEP-BC has substantial holdings of these arthropods, and as digitized records for these specimens are migrated to Arctos (the online database in use at UTEP), these data can be easily captured by into the SCAN network and shared with iDigBio (www.iDigBio.org).  A primary goal of this project is to provide georeferenced coordinate data (via GEOLocate and other resources) and other quality-control corrections for 25,725 collection events (representing ca. 232,000 specimens) that predate modern GPS technology (before 2000) for the five focal arthropod groups in the UTEP-BC collections. Overall, this will increase the total number of recently catalogued specimens by SCAN from 253,717 to 485,717, an increase of 90%.

NGS has become an essential tool for the life science research. These technologies are used to address many fundamental questions in various fields of biology allowing one to find exact differences between samples (for instance, related species) via comparison to a reference genome. While single-nucleotide mismatches are robustly identified in such studies, precise and reliable detection of more complex changes, genome rearrangements, still presents a significant problem and solving this problem will benefit a large number of biological researchers. The expected deluge of available genome sequences in the near future will require novel approaches for automated functional predictions dealing with ""big data"" on a scale unimaginable today. Reliable identification of rearrangements will be an important step in such automated genome annotation. Active involvement and a strong interaction of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral-level participants on Rutgers-Camden campus is foreseen (including members of underrepresented minority groups) in these research activities. All of this work will have a strong synergy with the NSF award supporting the high-performance computational facilities on campus.<br/><br/>With this award, a novel approach for finding genome rearrangements will be developed, based on integrating multiple lines of evidence and logical constraints on mapped paired reads. It will evaluate for each nucleotide in a reference sequence a likelihood of involvement in a rearrangement event. Given the rapidly changing filed of NGS the methodology will also allow for including of novel types of evidence, for example, long reads, to improve predictions of rearrangements. As a result of this research a functional algorithm will be implemented with a user interface, displaying complex rearrangements and highlighting available evidence from the sequence data in a convenient graphical form, together with genomic context information. The algorithm will be described in publications and at scientific meetings and will be made publicly available. This will aid in interpretation of evolutionary, functional and other roles of the detected genomic changes and result in substantial improvements in NGS data analysis in many areas of biology."

Located on the shores of an oxbow lake that is part of a largely unaltered watershed connected by a series of rivers and streams, the potential of CCBS to advance scientific knowledge of tropical aquatic systems is substantial. Yet, in contrast to the long legacy of research on terrestrial systems at the station and in the surrounding Amazonian forests, few studies have addressed the aquatic ecosystem on which the diverse animal and plant life, as well as the local human populations, depend. This project will build infrastructure, acquire research vessels, and adopt new technologies for investigators to address this knowledge gap. Because the CCBS provides unrivalled access to complex biological systems undisturbed by human activities, there is great opportunity to pursue questions in aquatic ecology where evolutionary processes are still much the same as they were before humanity arrived on the scene.  For the same reason, the CCBS can serve as a reference landscape providing comparative data to understand the impacts of human disturbance and environmental change. This project will engage a diverse contingent of scientists from the United States, Peru and elsewhere to work together under a collaborative umbrella to understand how this aquatic ecosystem functions and how it can be maintained to serve the interest of biodiversity, environmental quality, and human needs. The collaborative nature of this work will also serve to build relations between U.S. scientists and emerging and established Peruvian professionals and government representatives, and thus help build local capacity in science, help build the careers of U.S. scientists, support educational and training opportunities for U.S. and Peruvian citizens, and create positive ties between the two countries. <br/><br/>Research at the CCBS explores fundamental and unanswered ecological questions of tropical ecology. Despite the field station's location in the Amazonian floodplain between an oxbow lake and the Manu River, aquatic ecosystem research has been neglected historically, contrasting with its strong research record in terrestrial ecosystems. The paucity of data in this area ensures the novelty of new research initiatives and the provision of sensors and instrumentation will facilitate multi-disciplinary research that integrates data collected on organisms and their abiotic environment, a fundamental objective in ecology. Because terrestrial and aquatic systems are coupled, aquatic research will inform the robust body of research conducted on land. NSF  support will allow cutting edge research performed at CCBS to grow into the 21st century and expand into aquatic ecosystems of the Peruvian Amazon, thus providing fundamental data for tropical ecosystems and exploring new directions that inform global change biology. This expansion may include new studies on hydroecology, flood plain dynamics, nutrient transport, ecological characterization of migratory fish and birds, drivers of aquatic ecosystem biodiversity, and emerging anthropogenic impacts on these systems and specific species such as the giant otter and the black caiman.  A successful expansion of an aquatic research program at the CCBS requires that several obstacles are addressed. To address these limitations, FSML funds will be used to purchase three research vessels, fully equipped with sensors and specialized aquatic monitoring equipment; construct a laboratory for storing and processessing aquatic samples, and construct cabins for researcher accommodation. An expanded aquatic research at CCBS will have significant conservation application, guiding park management activities and informing conservation and restoration goals in Amazonian systems, and directly increasing knowledge for the management of conservation-dependent species such as the giant otter. Together, these activities will help maintain a healthy aquatic ecosystem to support human and natural communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this biodiversity resides in the fire-dependent longleaf pine-wiregrass communities and associated seepage slopes and pitcher-plant bogs, sand hills, barrier islands, Carolina bays, tupelo swamps, mesic slopes with Appalachian affinities, and blackland prairies of the Coastal Plain.  Georgia is the fourth most rapidly growing state in the U.S. and the fastest in the Southeast, and its native plants and ecosystems are threatened by land development and invasive exotic plants.  A collection of more than 70,000 museum-quality specimens, the Valdosta State University Herbarium has major strength and focus on plant diversity of the Georgia Coastal Plain.   It is the primary resource for scientific research about plants of this region.  The online availability of digital photographs and the data from biological collections greatly increases access to specimens and the potential for using these biodiversity resources in diverse ways, including the assessment of the ecological and conservation status of species and ecosystems, and changing trends in populations of plant species, related to climate change, habitat degradation, and the introduction of exotic species.  The virtual access enabled by this project will promote knowledge, use, and recognition of the valuable biodiversity data in the Valdosta State University Herbarium.<br/><br/>This project will enhance infrastructure of the Valdosta State University Herbarium through the installation of a high-density storage system that will increase its specimen holding capacity by about 30%.  The new compactor system will provide secure and safe storage of this irreplaceable biodiversity resource and will sustain its growth for the next 15 years.  This project will provide funds to mount and digitize 5,000 specimens and provide precise geographical coordinates for nearly 15,000 specimen records, making vitally important specimens and their associated digital photographs and data available to the community of biodiversity researchers and others online.  This project will also secure and revitalize the extensive and currently dormant Vanderbilt University Teaching Collections by bringing them to Valdosta State University where they will be used to train future generations of students and biodiversity researchers.  The specialized learning promoted through the direct involvement of undergraduate students in curating and digitizing biological collections and in biodiversity research will bring new perspectives on potential careers in science.  Students will present their work at scientific meetings, and opportunities provided through this project will enable the participation of under-represented groups.  Outreach programs targeting young people at an impressionable age, their teachers, and others will bring issues of biological collections and biodiversity before a large and diverse audience through herbarium tours, informal presentations, and a summer workshop for teachers.  All data resulting from this project will be posted online (http://herb.valdosta.edu/) and shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.

The move will be combined with an update to the database, making it compatible with international standards for collections data. Thus, information from all specimens held by the Museum will become broadly accessible to the general public. The Museum's extensive regional collection of birds and mammals provides a unique historical perspective on modern species distributions and genetic responses to landscape changes. The relocation and digitization of this substantial collection will provide training and discovery opportunities in biology and museum science for high school and undergraduate students, including summer internships for four students from Montana tribal colleges.<br/><br/>The project will provide urgently needed curatorial upgrades to the collection of more than 20,000 specimens of modern-day vertebrates at the University of Montana Zoological Museum (UMZM). As the largest collection of modern land vertebrate specimens from Montana, and among the largest such vertebrate collections in the northern Rocky Mountains, the UMZM provides an important source of materials for research, formal education, and outreach. Current University of Montana faculty are actively using the collections to study diverse questions biological questions, however, the potential for broader accessibility, ongoing specimen preservation, and future growth is severely limited by current infrastructure. Securing the collection will occur via transfer of all research specimens to new cabinets in an archival space. This move will also result in a fourfold increase of the area available to work with the specimens. Building on UM's active incorporation of the collections into undergraduate teaching and research, this project will increase outreach to the local public by new exhibits of UMZM collections centered on seasonal themes, training of K12 teachers to help incorporate biodiversity science into their curricula, and mentored internships at the UMZM of Native American students from regional tribal colleges. The project's activities will be documented at the UMZM's new website (hs.umt.edu/UMZM). The new database will, for the first time, allow web-based access to specimen data from the UMZM collections for academic and other researchers via VertNet and Arctos.  These data will be shared with and made accessible with iDigBio (idigbio.org)."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. With more than 50 percent of known species found on just six percent of the Earth's surface, tropical rainforests are famous for their incredible biodiversity. Still, little is actually known about how these species originate. In large part, this gap in our knowledge exists because the bulk of evolution research focuses on plants and animals from temperate regions. As a result, we know little about species formation in the most species rich area on Earth. This project will investigate factors that drive tropical tree evolution and contribute to our basic understanding of how species form. The fellow will receive training in genomic data collection and analysis and will foster the next generation of scientists through mentoring. In order to increase the retention of post-graduate women in STEM fields the fellow will also organize panel discussions to provide insight on navigating a science career while balancing family and also to introduce students to non-academic careers in science.<br/><br/>The tropical tree, Protium subserratum, exhibits genetic, morphological, and defense chemistry differences associated with different soil habitats across the Amazon. Adaptation to different soils thus appears to be driving diversification within the group, and herbivore pressure may further strengthen selection across habitat boundaries. This project will integrate morphological, spectral, ecological, geographic and genomic data from herbarium collections to understand lineage diversification within P. subserratum. The evolutionary history of the species will be reconstructed using methods that account for historic and contemporary processes to test whether habitat specialization onto different soils evolved multiple times across the Amazon or whether habitat specialization onto each soil type arose once and was followed by subsequent dispersal. The hypotheses that habitat shifts explain the observed patterns of phenotypic differentiation and that genetic and phenotypic differentiation are correlated will be tested using comparative phylogenetic methods and estimates of genetic structure and gene flow. Finally, the hypothesis that herbivore pressure is strengthening selection across soil boundaries will be investigated by testing for signatures of selection in genes from the terpene synthase and flavonoid gene pathways. The fellow will develop expertise in phylogenomic, population genomic and comparative genomic analyses. The fellow will also organize panel presentations to increase participation of women in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CICHAZ is located in the unique Sierra y Huasteca region of central Mexico, an area high in biological and cultural diversity but devoid of academic and research institutions. This field station is associated with Texas A&M University and hosts an increasing number of scientists annually who need a broad array of scientific resources. Since its founding in 2005, CICHAZ has hosted over 150 researchers in the natural and social sciences from over 30 institutions internationally, fostered 9 Ph.D. and two Master's theses, and attracted 11 NSF-funded projects. CICHAZ has provided research and cultural experiences for undergraduates, local residents, and members of the U.S. public. In addition to long-term lodging for up to 11 researchers, the station has built up facilities including an indoor fishroom, an array of 24 aquatic mesocosms, and a small laboratory for molecular biology. This award will provide the infrastructure and equipment for collecting and analyzing genomic data; controlled husbandry of plants and animals; and ecological and evolutionary studies in the region. <br/><br/>With this grant, an existing laboratory will be converted into a standard molecular wet lab, featuring a MinIon genome sequencer. This will enable researchers to collect and analyze nucleic acid data in situ within the course of a field stay. Two new greenhouse facilities will be erected to house animals and plants for controlled studies, as well as sustainable improvements to address the anticipated increase in energy needs. Finally, the station will acquire a mobile laboratory flexibly equipped with instruments for stream sampling, water quality analysis, and sedimentary core extraction. These proposed improvements have fundamental impacts on outreach efforts, and will ensure success of broader impacts initiatives including research experiences for US and Mexican undergraduates, and for local K-12 students, focused on integrating field and environmental approaches with state-of-the-art techniques for measurement and analysis. The mobile laboratory will revolutionize engagement with schools and with remote indigenous communities, by enabling visiting researchers to work with staff in designing outreach programs in local communities."

Many modern cellular and molecular biology techniques use natural fluorescence, fluorescently tagged molecules, or fluorescent dyes to label specific cellular components. A confocal microscope is an instrument that uses lasers to produce high resolution images of cellular and subcellular components within living and fixed cells that have been labeled with one or more fluorescent molecules. In addition, 3D reconstructions of these fluorescent structures can be created using a series of images collected by the confocal microscope as it focuses down through a specimen. Consequently, this instrument has the resolving power to address many types of biological problems including identifying cell types, cellular localization of specific molecules, determining gene expression, and examining cell differentiation. The research faculty involved in this project require the enhanced flexibility of use and special capabilities (e.g., UV laser, spectral detector, and environmental chamber) of this confocal system to obtain quality images of their work for their contributions to their scientific fields, including publications, national and international meeting presentations, student training, and other applications. Thus, this award will broaden research, training, and teaching opportunities both at SLU and the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley Consortium.  Acquisition of this instrument will expand the existing partnership between SLU and Clarkson University (CU), especially increasing summer fellowship projects for CSTEP and McNair Scholars; two programs that support students from populations underrepresented in STEM. In addition, the new microscope will fuel outreach activities for dozens of K-12 teachers, students, and community members in our economically disadvantaged, rural region of northern New York.<br/><br/>A Nikon C2+ spectral imaging confocal microscope system with wide field camera and environmental chamber systems and specialized capabilities will support and expand current and future research, teaching, and undergraduate training activities of STEM faculty and students at the Associated Colleges of the St. Lawrence Valley (SLU, Clarkson, SUNY  Potsdam, and SUNY Canton), a higher education consortium in upstate New York. The new instrument will augment the research and scholarly contributions of research faculty and enhance teaching and training activities of eleven faculty and science professionals in cell and developmental biology and ecology and evolution, including the PI and Co-PIs' projects, which focus on the theme of subcellular trafficking and tissue localization of specific molecules during development. The acquisition of this confocal microscope will provide the flexibility important for all users to achieve successful imaging with their respective biological systems of study, while also being easy to use and having a relatively low cost infrastructure. In particular, this system will allow research faculty to explore the biological effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles; gene expression in cheilostome bryozoans; and the essential role of the evolutionarily conserved IME4 mRNA methyltransferase in metazoan development. High-resolution imaging is required to publish in high profile cell and molecular biology journals, and confocal microscopy is now the expected minimal standard for publishing microscopy-based research using fluorescence.  Specifically, this instrument will positively impact the relatively new field of cerium oxide nanoparticles, as the new system will enable Drs. Erlichman and Estevez to characterize how the chemistry of cerium oxide nanoparticles influences their cellular trafficking and whether cellular localization influences pro-oxidant vs antioxidant effects. Body axes are determined multiple times during the bryozoan life cycle (embryogenesis, metamorphosis, and asexual budding). Using the proposed instrument, Dr. Temkin will acquire data on Hox gene expression during two different patterns of asexual budding. These data will provide a foundation to examine Hox gene expression at other points in the bryozoan life cycle. Lastly, a fundamental question in developmental biology is how cell fates are determined. To answer this, Dr. Hongay will employ the new microscope to perform high resolution confocal analyses to determine how a highly evolutionarily conserved RNA-modifying enzyme dictates cell fates and cell differentiation in Drosophila spermatogenesis."

Such names consist of two words in Latin - genus name and specific epithet - for example, Homo sapiens for humans. For higher classifications Linneaus adopted names consisting of a single Latin word. This nomenclatural system dramatically simplified handling species information, and gave scientists from different countries a standard way of communication. This system has been so successful it has persisted for over 250 years and is still in very active use today. An enormous amount of scientific and popular science literature uses scientific names. In the electronic age scientific names enable the effective organization of biodiversity information from various sources, as demonstrated by the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org) and Biodiversity Heritage Library (http://bhl.org). However the naming system introduced by Linnaeus is far from perfect. For example, if scholars decide to move a particular species to different genus - the name changes, and finding information about it becomes much more difficult. For example, a very prominent model organism of modern science Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) is now recommended to be placed in the genus Sophophora, changing its name to Sophophora melanogaster. Such changes are inevitable in Linnaean nomenclature, and they create a significant amount of confusion. The project aims to create a system which would allow a user to enter a name, and find out if it is a known scientific name, if another name should be used instead, if there are other historical synonyms, and if this name is a misspelling of a known scientific name. The system will also display which data sources contain information related to a name, and will provide a list of relevant web-pages (URLs). This project aims to make significant strides in removing ambiguity and confusion from biodiversity data. Teaching activities are planned with college students at Arizona State and there are opportunities for participation in Google Summer of Code and Biodiversity informatics training courses developed at MBL.<br/><br/>The first stage of the research was also funded by NSF and it allowed the development of a prototype and 'proof of concept' algorithms for finding and verifying scientific names in texts, images, species lists. This second phase aims to make production version of the algorithms, make them precise, fast, and scale them up to serve the global biological community.  The task of scientific name disambiguation is not a simple one. It requires cooperation of many researchers. Discovery of scientific names in texts uses natural language processing algorithms which we plan to improve. The project aims to collect all known spellings and renderings of scientific names (20 million are currently collected) and organizes them into groups belonging to the same sets of organisms. It also catalogues where each spelling was used and stores information as a global name index. The database is powered by a search engine which uses fuzzy matching algorithms, and name parsing algorithms to find that names like 'Carek scirpoidea Michx. var. convoluta Kük.' and 'Carex scirpoidea subsp. convoluta (Kukenth) D. A. Dunlop' refer to the same<br/>subspecies. The project's URL is: http://globalnames.org/"

Consequently, an introduction to both descriptive and inferential statistical thinking is now standard practice for the undergraduate biology course ""Bio 101"" - a course taken by over 1.2 million students in the U.S. annually. Despite the large numbers of students in introductory biology courses, there is a dearth of active discussion about teaching and assessment when integrating statistical thinking into biology courses. Recently, the statistics education community has established guidelines for assessment and instructional best practices when teaching statistics. Furthermore, there is a prominent movement to use modern, computationally-intensive statistical methods (simulation, randomization tests, and bootstrapping) that utilize active learning pedagogical strategies and have preliminary evidence of improving student learning. Despite these recent changes, there are limited venues to discuss and coordinate best practices for the teaching and assessment of statistical thinking for biology students - many of whom may never take an Introductory Statistics course or will take such a course at a very different time than their introductory biology course. To address these challenges, the Statistical Thinking in Undergraduate Biology (STUB) network will be formed, consisting of over 500 biology and statistics instructors. The network will directly impact over 100,000 students during the five-year period of the award, with many thousands impacted in the following years. With particular focus on a diverse set of institutions, backgrounds, and learning environments (e.g., institutions serving large numbers of underrepresented and underserved students, including two-year colleges), the project has the potential for effecting a substantial change in the content and focus of the teaching of statistical thinking in undergraduate biology across the country.<br/><br/>As part of the network, participants will engage in workshops and an online learning community dedicated to the discussion and sharing of ideas, resources, and techniques. A key tangible outcome of the workshops and online learning community will be freely available, class-tested, and edited modules co-developed by biologists and statisticians for use in teaching statistical ideas. The STUB network will also serve to assist in coordinating the assessment of statistical thinking and student attitudes in introductory biology courses. The network will share best practices on assessment, vet potential assessment items, and share assessment results, as well as evaluate the efficacy of the workshops and the online learning community in improving instructor and student outcomes. The STUB network will provide a forum for serious and impactful discussions about teaching statistics in introductory biology courses, resulting in (a) the development and wide dissemination of numerous freely available modules and assessment items for teaching, (b) published peer-reviewed articles on teaching best practices and assessment results related to statistical thinking in undergraduate biology courses, (c) a long-lasting improvement in the teaching of statistical thinking in the undergraduate biology curriculum, and (d) introductory statistics courses reflecting the needs and perspective of biology (and other quantitative science) students.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).

In order to understand how these genetic pathways function, one must identify and understand the patterns of DNA elements that ultimately control these genes. To address this fundamental scientific challenge in biological informatics, this project will use pattern recognition techniques in order to develop a detailed understanding of the way in which plant genes are controlled by DNA-encoded information. In order to do this, we will develop specific computational techniques for building and interpreting pattern recognition models. The most important aspect of this research is creating algorithms with the ability to recognize when a number of different DNA element patterns provide biologically relevant solutions for gene control. The algorithms, models, and biological outcomes developed by this project will be made available to the scientific community, including the plant science community. The underlying computational methods are expected to be applicable in many other fields of science and engineering. Teaching and training modules developed by this project will include outreach to our underserved communities of rural Oregon, including hands-on science experiences for high school students, as well as teacher training. The modules will draw special attention to the need for computationally trained researchers in the plant sciences, and to the need for a dramatically increased understanding of plant gene regulatory networks as a foundation for new drug discovery, agricultural, and materials biosynthesis challenges. <br/><br/>The combinatorial control of gene expression by Transcription Factors (TFs) is one of the most fundamental regulatory mechanisms across the eukaryotic tree of life, from plants to humans. The DNA region surrounding the start of a gene, called the promoter region, contains short regulatory sequence elements known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). In plants, despite the many exciting potential advances that hinge on a detailed understanding of plant gene regulation, relatively little is known about the specific TFBS patterns that lead to gene expression. This project uses and extends a machine learning model developed by the Megraw lab that is able to predict the presence of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) with high accuracy and resolution. A primary advantage of this model is that it suggests specific sets of TFBS:promoter interactions which have the potential to 'turn on' a particular gene. This model makes novel use of currently available high-throughput TSS data to examine the global structure of promoters in the model plant Arabidopsis, and in preliminary research suggests striking unanticipated differences between plant and animal DNA regulatory codes. The goal of this project is to rigorously test and expand this promising new computational approach for dissecting which TFBS sets are optimal predictors of gene up-regulation in a biological sample. The relative simplicity of the Arabidopsis genome makes this challenge tractable, yet capable of providing transformative insight into gene regulation in a multicellular organism.

The FACS machine will enhance the mission of the Department of Biological Sciences and stimulate an interdisciplinary program with the Departments of Chemistry and Computer Science by allowing hands-on, high impact research between undergraduate students, Master's students, and faculty members. This scientific instrument will prepare biology majors for careers in the biological sciences and enhance educational opportunities for students at the undergraduate and Master's level by being utilized in multiple lower- and upper-division classes, advanced research-focused classes, and for individual student research projects outside of the classroom. Importantly, the FACS will catalyze an interdisciplinary effort between scientific departments, improving the educational experience of biology, chemistry, and computer science students by allowing authentic research projects for students to collaborate on. These collaborations are essential; the ability to work together as an interdisciplinary team to solve complex problems is an essential aspect of modern research that many students do not have adequate exposure to. Additionally, acquisition of a FACS machine will establish CSU Chico, a Hispanic- serving public university with a service area that spans 21% of rural California, as a leading undergraduate institution in Northern California for immunology, chemical biology, and bioinformatics. Allowing our diverse student population with different scientific backgrounds to perform interdisciplinary research activities with their peers will build their enthusiasm for research, encouraging students from this traditionally underserved rural population to pursue further studies that combine these research fields. This investment in research capital will also allow faculty and students to attain more research grants, allowing more hands-on, practical, high-impact learning that benefits the community.<br/><br/>In modern biology, deciphering an organism's genome and understanding the effects of changes in the gene expression of a given tissue, organ, and individual cells is now standard methodology, requiring the isolation of individual cells before interrogating changes in their gene expression.

Additionally, the FACS machine will be utilized to study microbial ecology in diverse geological locations in Northern California, to analyze how microbial and viral pathogens infect a wide variety of cells, and to understand plant and animal cell cycle control, the regulation of cell death, and protein expression. Importantly, data generated from these studies requires combining knowledge of biological processes, chemical signaling, and computational analyses, necessitating that biologists, chemists, and computer scientists work together to solve complex problems."

The projects supported by this new instrumentation aim to increase productivity of food and biofuel crops through a detailed understanding of how plants turn energy provided by the sun to biomass and how plants sense and coordinate their physiology in response to seasonal change using their internal biological timepiece known as the circadian clock.  As part of the development of new technologies, the investigators will perform a special study with undergraduates from Harris-Stowe State University and other nearby undergraduate institutions' students to mine the large data stream anticipated to come from the new instrument for biological treasure. The students will get firsthand experience with the contemporary proteomics techniques that may open the door to further bioanalytical studies in their careers.  This will add to the educational outreach taking place at the Danforth Center. Currently, the training of tomorrow's scientists occurs through an active NSF-REU program, recruitment of high school students that work in Danforth Center laboratories for classroom credit, participation in a regional program for high school students - STARS (Students and Teachers As Research Scientists), workshops for teachers and an interactive middle- and high school mentoring program that connects our scientists with nearby schools.

However, the technology still has limitations that restrict its quantitative power. Researchers face an experimental trade-off between exploring either fewer cells for higher accuracy or a greater number of cells for a broader survey of gene expression. Further, scRNA-seq technology is still so new that a variety of experimental protocols exist that are subject to different bias and errors, presenting a hurdle for data validation, cross-referencing between labs, and normalization and integration of data from public repositories.

The research will advance computational approaches for modeling and analyzing epigenomic data in several important new dimensions. One dimension involves developing computational methods for modeling epigenomic changes over time. A number of important biological processes are now being studied by mapping multiple epigenetic marks at multiple time points raising the need for new computational approaches to model and analyze this data. Another dimension involves computational approaches to predicting the genome- wide signals of epigenetic marks in cell types in which a mark is not mapped. This is a key computational problem because it is unfeasible to experimentally map every epigenetic mark in every cell type of interest. A third dimension of the project involves computational methods to associate putative distal regulatory elements identified by epigenomic maps with the target genes they regulate by integrating multiple partially informative data sources to these interactions.<br/><br/>As part of the CAREER project Jason Ernst will contribute to the creation of a computational biosciences collaboratory at UCLA, aimed at simultaneously increasing the training of biological researchers in computational approaches and facilitating collaborations between computational and experimental researchers. A new research- focused graduate seminar that covers research topics in computational epigenomics will be created. Course projects for an undergraduate bioinformatics course based on the research will also be created. Undergraduate students, under-represented minority students, and women computer science students will be recruited to participate in research. All instructional material created will be disseminated on the internet. Computational methods developed under this project will be broadly disseminated as open source software and will likely be used by a wide range of biological researchers for a number of important biological applications."

Research conducted on the bison herd resident at KPBS is an essential component to this understanding. In addition to examining the direct effects of bison grazing on the ecosystem, studies also examine the indirect effects of bison grazing on the behavior and diversity of other species, as well as characteristics of the bison (seasonal weight gains, reproduction, etc.) in response to grassland conditions such as drought. All KPBS bison have a unique ID and because each individual is weighed annually, KPBS now has the longest continuous database of individual weight gains of a native ungulate population in the world. However, these weights are mostly recorded during the fall round-up and so provide only a partial picture of bison performance.  New, remote Tru-Test scales, capable of taking weights on bison as they walk across the scales, will be installed onsite and provide important data on changes in weight throughout the year.  Also, the corral used for the annual round-up will be expanded to include eight working pens that will provide new opportunities for research on individual bison (such as feeding trials).  Finally, additional access gates will be added to the bison perimeter fence at key sampling areas in order to increase efficiency and safety for all scientists needing access the bison grazed area.  These upgrades will not only assure the continuation of the bison grazing experiment that is essential to several long-term research initiatives (e.g. the KPBS Long Term Ecological Research program and the National Ecological Observatory Network) and to individual investigators, but will also increase the flexibility of the site and open opportunities for future research. The new avenues of research generated by this expansion will also add to the numerous educational and training activities already conducted at KPBS or using data generated on-site. The KPBS will continue to benefit science and society through basic, policy-relevant, and applied research while providing opportunity and training for students in an endangered grassland ecosystem.<br/><br/>Grazing by free roaming large mammalian herbivores was a key driver of the structure and function of North American grasslands prior to European settlement.  Geographically, bison were distributed in large and small herds throughout the tallgrass, mixed grass, and shortgrass prairies where they had significant impact on ecosystem processes.  For this reason, understanding the ecological role of bison in tallgrass prairies has been considered an essential overarching research goal at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS - http://kpbs.konza.k-state.edu/) since its inception. The bison experiment simulates near natural patterns of bison grazing and impacts on the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, including interactions with the key ecosystem drivers of fire and climate. The herd is managed to provide a year-long grazing intensity typical of natural sub-humid tall grasslands resulting in approximately 25% removal of annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP). In addition to the effects of bison grazing on grassland structure and function, studies also examine bison performance (e.g. seasonal weight gains) in response to grassland conditions.  All KPBS bison have unique IDs and because each individual is weighed annually during fall round-up, KPBS now has the longest continuous database of individual weight gains of a native ungulate population in the world. This award will support three aspects of the bison experiments; new remote scales, modification of an existing corral and new access points in the perimeter of the existing bison fence.  Installation of additional remote Tru-Test scales will increase the frequency of seasonal bison mass data at KBPS and add long-term value to the current extensive database managed by KPBS.  The corral will also be expanded to include eight working pens that will provide new opportunities for research on individual bison (e.g. pen feeding trials).  Finally, additional access points will be added to the bison perimeter fence at key sampling areas to increase efficient use and safety for all scientists needing access to the bison grazed area. These upgrades are necessary to maintain the existing long-term bison grazing experiment on KPBS that is essential to the KPBS Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), numerous other investigators (both K-State and non K-State scientists) and, more importantly, to increase the flexibility of this valuable long-term experiment for current and future investigators."

La Selva research on forest dynamics and gas exchange, much of which has been carried out using these canopy towers, has played a leadership role in helping understand the significance of carbon dynamics in tropical forests under changing climatic conditions. The La Selva Canopy Tower Network is an ideal site for integrated flux monitoring of a tropical rainforest, given that is has been intensively studied with long-term datasets documenting ecological and ecosystem dynamics, and a wide range of ongoing and planned research projects using the towers. The second-generation tower network to be deployed under this award will provide continuous data on ecosystem fluxes and concurrent detailed canopy and soil environmental conditions valuable for a broad range of data analysis, synthesis, and modelling efforts. These towers already provide a valuable platform for experiential learning for both graduate and undergraduate students. Each year, La Selva hosts more than 10,000 days of student visitation to the station. OTS courses bring approximately 150 undergraduates and 150 graduate students to La Selva to learn how to conduct their own research. An important component of the OTS education programs is its emphasis on recruiting and advancing students underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Over the last five years, 24% of all U.S. undergraduates in the OTS education programs are from under-represented groups in the STEM disciplines. Additionally, more than 120 faculty-led academic groups from the US, Europe, and Costa Rica visit the station each year. Some courses, especially those run by OTS, encourage students to conduct short-term projects using the towers and their sensors. OTS also runs summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates comprised of more than 80% minority students. These students spend 10 weeks at the station and have the opportunity to conduct their summer research using the tower network.<br/><br/>The canopy tower network had a recent setback caused by a treefall that affected the functionality of three towers. OTS is in the process of dismantling and re-establishing the fallen towers. While disruptive, this accident has also presented an opportunity to address the limitations of the previous system and rebuild the network of canopy towers and sensors to create a state-of-the-art ecosystem flux and bio-meteorology (biomet) monitoring system that can significantly expand the research opportunities of the tower network. In addition, a redesign of the tower walkway and installation of updated safety equipment will allow the new canopy tower network to be safer and less vulnerable to future disruptions. Specifically, as the three damaged towers are resurrected, we propose to develop a second-generation canopy tower system by adding the following flux-biomet instrumentation and safety features: (1) Eddy covariance system including a sonic anemometer, CO2-H2O analyzer, and canopy CO2-H2O profile system in order to continuously measure ecosystem fluxes of carbon, water and energy; (2) Canopy monitoring sensors for continuous measurements of canopy air humidity and temperature including four component net radiometers and PAR sensors; (3) Soil monitoring sensors for continuous measurements of soil CO2 and O2 concentration, moisture, and temperature; (4) Additional tower section to increase the height of two the tower to 50 meters (the height of the tallest canopy trees in the area); (5) Addition of mid-canopy walkway to increase access to new canopy levels; (6) Additional safety features including break-away bolts and anchors; and (7) Improved connectivity in WiFi and fiber-optic systems to increase the remote-operability of data collection and management. The new flux-biomet monitoring system combined with the improved and more robust tower infrastructure thus provide an integrated upgrade in the facilities for research at La Selva that will have broad use for existing and new research programs in tropical ecology and ecosystem science. The towers will also significantly expand the training experience and increase the safety of US and Latin American students using the towers."

Development of the single-cell mass spectrometer will require regular interactions between analytical chemists, biologists, mass spectrometrists, and curators of data repositories, essentially creating an interdisciplinary environment for students and researchers to accomplish training beyond the classical curriculum in these disciplines. By demonstrating the device at the George Washington University and discussing its design, performance, and use at national conferences and publications, this work will broaden scientific literacy and inform of the availability of the device to a broader base of users. Data resulting from measurements on the production of biomolecules during embryogenesis will be disseminated in publicly accessible data repositories, providing a larger number of users with access to facilitate research and education in cell and developmental biology and neuroscience. Notably, the combination of these scientific and outreach elements, including participation of local high-school students in the project, will enhance research and education at the interface of biology, instrument development, and analytical chemistry, providing interdisciplinary solutions to current and future challenges in science and education. <br/><br/>Characterization of biomolecular expression in single cells of the embryo will provide new insights into basic biochemical mechanisms that orchestrate embryonic development, the complex suite of processes by which a fertilized egg gives rise to an entire, fully functioning organism such as the frog, fish, or human.

The fellow, Robert Habig, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by David Lahti at Queens College, City University of New York. The goal of the fellow's project is to perform a comparative evolutionary analysis of nest construction in the weaverbirds (Ploceus spp.).  The evolutionary history of behavior can be nearly intractable and resistant to quantitative analysis. One strategy for illuminating our understanding of behavioral evolution is to conduct comparative studies of animal architectures, such as nests. Unlike behaviors themselves, nests persist through time, and have structures that can be disassociated into several quantitative features, which permits easy and comparable measurements and allows scientists to address questions about evolutionary history and functional relevance. The fellow's research addresses two major questions: (1) How do patterns of nest construction vary within and between species? (2) How do interrelated evolutionary processes shape variation in nest structure? This project is important for advancing foundational scientific knowledge, and will be the first study of weavers incorporating both molecular data and nest morphology to better understand the evolutionary underpinnings of a complex behavioral process. The fellow is also broadening participation in science by mentoring students underrepresented in biology.<br/><br/>The Fellow will reconstruct the evolution of nest construction in Ploceus weaverbirds incorporating advanced phylogenetic and morphological techniques including bioinformatics, computer modeling, X-ray computed tomography, and image processing. The Fellow will also conduct fieldwork in two hotspots of weaverbird diversity, the Awash Valley in Ethiopia and the Limpopo Province of South Africa, and collect behavioral data (e.g. rates of predation and brood parasitism; mating and parental behavior) and morphological data (e.g. nest structure) to test hypotheses of how distinct types of evolutionary selection shape the evolution of nest construction. The proposed comparative study can thus address questions such as how rapidly certain nest structural features evolve, which features are ancestral versus derived, which tend to exhibit phylogenetic signal, and which evolve in response to environmental features. The Fellow is receiving training in three-dimensional morphological analyses, phylogenetic tree construction, bioinformatics, computer modeling, and mentoring skills. The plan to broaden participation includes (1) recruitment, training, and mentoring of Queens College students from underrepresented groups in biology; (2) designing an evolutionary biology curriculum that ties in the research of the fellowship; (3) teaching an evolutionary biology class to underrepresented middle and high school students at the American Museum of Natural History; and (4) facilitating a research team for middle school and high school students."

Producing enough food and energy for a world population likely exceeding 9.7 billion by 2050 is the greatest challenge facing agriculture. Compared to modern genomic sequencing technologies, plant phenomics lags behind in its capacity and throughput. The instrument developed in this research will alleviate this limitation, allow more efficient genotype-phenotype analysis, and ultimately catalyze the acceleration of crop improvements (in terms of yield and stress tolerance) to solve the looming global food security challenge. The project will foster a collaborative environment where the postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in plant biology, biological engineering, and computer science. The team will develop course materials that allow students in traditional plant biology to learn the new domain knowledge of sensing, instrumentation and data processing (this is a perceived gap in university plant biology curriculum). Discoveries from the project will be presented at international conferences on plant science and biological engineering and published in peer reviewed journals. The team will also collaborate with plant scientists at UNL and plant phenotyping groups around the world for the broad dissemination of the instrument. <br/><br/>This instrument can simultaneously probe chemical properties of plants (such as water, nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentration) through LASER imaging and measure 3D plant structure (such as size and spatial orientation of individual leaves) through LASER ranging. Through these measurements, more parameters related to plant physiology and functions (such as photosynthesis and stomatal activity) can be extracted. All the parameters will be spatially co-registered, eliminating the need for tedious data fusion. New algorithms will be developed to process massive 3D LASER point clouds and reconstruct plant leaf and stem surfaces. The performance of the instrument will be rigorously validated through a series of experiments involving stressed versus healthy plants. Taken together, the instrument provides transformative improvement in both capacity and throughput for plant shoot phenotyping, which will in turn benefit many fields of basic and applied plant biology research."

Small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNAs called microRNAs have been known to regulate genes involved in key aspects of animal development and physiology through binding-interactions with their mRNA targets. Since the first discovery of microRNAs in C. elegans in 1993, a large number of microRNAs have been discovered in metazoan, plants and viruses. Today, microRNAs are known to express ubiquitously in almost all cell types, evolutionarily conserved in most of metazoan and plant species, and potentially regulate more than 30% of mammalian gene products. Understanding of microRNAs' regulatory functions in the fundamental biological processes is thus essential towards gaining a global view of gene regulation, but still at its early stages despite the rapid advances in microRNA biology. The project to study microRNA gene regulation and phenotype development seeks to generate many computational algorithms, which will be converted into software tools. These tools will be subsequently released as open-source and freely available software packages to the scientific community. The research is expected to have great impact on education at all levels. <br/><br/>The research will be incorporated into graduate, undergraduate and K-12 education. The research will also be disseminated to the research community, informal science education, and the public to enhance scientific understanding through freely distributed computational tools and web dissemination. In addition, mentoring and outreach for women and girls is planned to help attract more women into interdisciplinary science.<br/><br/>RNA is emerging as an important part of gene regulatory mechanisms under various phenotypic conditions. With the current unprecedented availability of genome-scale RNA genomics and transcriptomics data, the project seeks to create a set of computational algorithms and statistical methods to model microRNA binding interactions and discover microRNA interaction patterns that will help elucidate many functional roles of microRNAs in gene regulation. The advanced probabilistic model of microRNA binding activities promises to greatly benefit mRNA target recognition under specific phenotypic conditions, lay the foundation for further study of inter-microRNA interactions, and provide insight into microRNAs' functional mechanisms in gene regulation and phenotype formulation. The research is expected to not only advance scientific understanding of microRNAs' role in global gene regulation and phenotype development, but also stimulate interest in developing and advancing efficient computational modeling and data integration methods in the informatics research field.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The research focus is to understand the mechanisms underlying predator-prey dynamics in natural systems. Prey make behavioral decisions to decrease their chances of getting eaten, but the circumstances that elicit particular anti-predator responses are still poorly understood. As the choice of prey behavior can have cascading impacts on ecosystem dynamics, much work has been attempted to define how prey make these decisions. However, many of these models fail to predict observed anti-predator strategies in nature. The fellow will develop a new predator-prey framework, incorporating a rarely-explored dimension of complex communities. How predators modify their activity in response to competitors may substantially alter the risk prey ultimately experience. The fellow will study behavior of mammalian herbivores in ecosystems throughout Africa, using extensive networks of camera-traps to capture prey behavioral strategies under different predation regimes. To accomplish these aims, the fellow will work extensively with local scientists and students, providing valuable training to African K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, in addition to running capacity building workshops with government and non-governmental agencies. The fellow will develop teaching tools and citizen science programs to introduce the general public in the US and abroad to key concepts in ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>This research will quantify non-additive effects of multiple predators on overall predation risk by examining how prey mitigate combined risk at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The fellow test (I) whether predator-predator interactions affect how aggregate predation risk is structured spatiotemporally across a landscape, and (II) explore whether these synergies are modulated by functional traits of the prey or the environment by (III) developing novel statistical approaches for using camera-trap data. This framework will be parameterized using data from intact systems and tested to see whether removing hypothesized linkages between different predators predicts prey behavior in degraded systems where portions of the predator guild are extinct. The fellow will be working in multiple African countries during the course of this research and will expend significant effort training students locally and globally. She will also work to increase the participation of diverse groups in STEM by developing citizen science and online educational tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  An enduring goal in evolution and ecology is to understand how populations and species adapt to environmental conditions that vary over space and time. Studying local adaptation provides important insights into the biological processes that generate geographic variation in observable characteristics within and among populations. Furthermore, many populations and species have traits that have changed overtime, often in response to human-induced modifications of their natural habitat. This research will combine traditionally disparate data sources to quantify associations between phenotypic, environmental, and genetic variation in a widespread songbird, the Horned Lark. In examining geographic and temporal variation in camouflage among Horned Lark populations, this project will shed light on how organisms evolve local adaptations and cope with disturbances to their native habitat in a rapidly changing world.<br/><br/>The PIs will take standardized measurements of lark coloration and patterning by photographing museum specimens. These measurements will be compared to data acquired from two remote sensing instruments that vary in their spectral and spatial resolution. These phenotype-environment associations will then be considered alongside genotypic variation. After assembling a reference genome, the PIs will examine associations between genotypes and phenotypes to unravel the genetic architecture underlying adaptive coloration in larks. Finally, the PIs will examine phenotypic and genetic variation among a series of museum specimens that exhibit phenotypic change over time in response to increases in agricultural activity in the southwestern United States. In comparing genetic variation between darker-colored larks that were collected in the past ten years to lighter-colored larks that were collected more than 80 years ago in the same locality, this research will quantify the role of selection, drift, and gene flow in driving rapid phenotypic change over contemporary time scales. During their time as a post-doctoral research at UC Berkeley and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, the Fellow will learn a variety of bioinformatics techniques, remote sensing technologies, and museum curatorial skills that will benefit him throughout his career in the natural sciences. Furthermore, the Fellow will examine how involvement in natural history collections might influence undergraduate volition and retention in ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly among under-represented demographics in science.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared at scientific meetings."

The fellow, Jessica Goodheart, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by Dr. Todd Oakley at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The fellow's research focuses on the use of bioluminescence during courtship, in crustaceans called ostracods. In the animal kingdom, courtship displays using bioluminescence are relatively rare, yet occur in many types of organisms, including mollusks, arthropods, polychaetes and fish. Evidence suggests that the evolutionary origin of these displays is associated with an increase in biodiversity, within all of these different groups. This increase suggests that bioluminescent courtship behavior is an important character for speciation and evolution. The fellow seeks to determine the differences in body shape and form that may be associated with the origin of bioluminescence in ostracods and its use in this behavior. This research has the potential to provide important information regarding speciation and evolution as a general process. Finally, the fellow will be participating in multiple outreach activities, including K-12 teacher professional development and public interaction at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br/><br/>Ostracod crustaceans of the family Cypridinidae exhibit some of the most complex courtship displays in the marine realm, which incorporate bioluminescent pulses. It is clear that there is variation in the use of luminescence during these courtship displays (e.g. peak timing of courtship and intensity of the luminescence). However, little is known about the evolution of morphological characters that may be associated with the displays. To address these gaps, this research includes two objectives: 1) generate a well-supported phylogeny of Cypridinidae, and 2) determine the differences in morphology that may be associated with the origin of bioluminescence and its use in courtship within this family. A robust phylogeny will be generated using targeted sequence capture, followed by the collection of morphological data using nano-CT technology. These data will be compared among species in the new phylogenetic framework.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The research takes a data-driven and collections-focused approach to understand factors promoting the speciation process (i.e., formation of new species) and, therefore, the generation of biodiversity. The effort will illuminate the extent to which a reproductive bone structures may be involved in speciation in an ecologically important group of rodents, the squirrels. Such bone structures occur in some of the most diverse groups of mammals and may contribute to speciation via selection processes. Despite decades of scientific curiosity, however, the precise function of these bone structures is unknown in most groups. The fellow will leverage methods to quantify patterns of bone evolution including high-resolution imaging of museum specimens. This work will also provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate students and will broaden STEM participation at this level. Finally, this work will include science communication events that will bring evolutionary biology learning activities to the general public.<br/><br/>The research will leverage three ecologically distinct squirrel radiations (the genera Sciurus, Tamias, Urocitellus) as model systems. Key insights into mammalian evolutionary biology and selection process are expected via integration of novel genetic, morphometric, and biodiversity informatics datasets to test hypotheses on the role of reproductive structure specialization in mammals. A comparative framework will be established using phylogenomic methods to resolve phylogenies and past hybridization events. Evolutionary shape variation in bacula from focal species will be documented using CT scanning of specimens. Datasets describing bacular morphology will be captured and contrasted with those describing external organismal phenotypes gleaned from thousands of digitized museum records. Each will be analyzed in the context of geographic and niche overlap of constituent species to reveal whether patterns of bacular variation are consistent with a role in reproductive isolation of closely related lineages. All datasets will be accessible online and linked to original museum specimens, facilitating open access to the wealth of data contained in biological collections. Training outcomes include research opportunities focused on STEM-underrepresented undergraduates and dissemination of research concepts and empirical results in popular science fora. Outreach activities will increase public literacy on mammalian biodiversity and evolution, the speciation process, and the importance of biocollections for pressing scientific and societal issues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jan Vicente is ""Is the coral triangle a hot spot of sponge biodiversity?"" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Robert J. Toonen. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to characterize the biodiversity of sponges in the 'coral triangle.' This area is known for its generally high level of biodiversity, but there is very little information on biodiversity of sponges, an important yet cryptic group. The Fellow is using a newly-developed molecular tool called ezRAD that allows for efficient sequencing of genomes. Fewer than 1% of sponge holotype specimens in museums have been barcoded and none have had a genome sequenced. Genotyping holotype specimens will allow for proper phylogenetic analysis of closely related species. The Fellow is using this tool to analyze biodiversity on sponges that settle on Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) deployed in the Coral Triangle; this is allowing for assessment of sponge species and sponge populations of the sequenced holotype specimens. The Fellow is also making publicly available all of the sequence data, using the Sponge Barcoding Project, Porifera Tree of Life, GenBank and BOLD online databases. Making such data available to the public allows scientists to optimize the quality of barcodes to characterize sponge species that have settled on ARMS all over the world. The Fellow is also developing a web-based field guide with photographic images of each sponge species identified, with up to date discoveries of any cryptic new species. With the discovery of new species comes the opportunity to evaluate sponges for their ability to produce antibiotic drugs as sponges continue to be the leading phylum in the discovery of natural products. The Fellow is also submitting DNA samples from new described species to the Earth Microbiome Project, a citizen science initiative that helps reveal the world?s microbial diversity.<br/><br/>The Fellow is expanding his scientific horizons in several ways. He is gaining expertise in population genetics, phylogenetics and bioinformatics, which will help him achieve his future career goals. The Fellow is also mentoring students from underrepresented groups, working with the Toonen lab at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology. He is also giving public seminars through national and international meetings as well as general public presentations at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology, the Waikiki; Aquarium, the Bishop Museum, and the Hanauma Bay Lecture Series. The Fellow's previous working experience as a Nancy Foster Scholar with the education and outreach coordinator of NOAA's office of National Marine Sanctuaries allows him to continue participating in outreach events like ocean festivals, Biodiversity Day and Ocean Science Day. At the end of the award the Fellow plans to return to Puerto Rico, to become a professor and continue training the next generation of fellow Puerto Rican scientists."

The fellow, Carla Stout, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Ángel Valdés at California State Polytechnic University. This research examines the phylogenomics of nudibranchs (sea slugs) using newly developed DNA sequencing technologies that have proven useful for other problematic groups (e.g. fish, birds, spiders, etc.) when elucidating deep levels of relatedness. Nudibranchs are diverse (~3000 species) in terms of body forms, reproductive and developmental modes, feeding specializations, and defensive mechanisms. Elucidating how these biological facets have evolved has been difficult with the current lack of understanding of the relationships among the species, which is crucial for identifying their evolutionary patterns. This study will provide the first extensive collection of high-throughput sequence data for nudibranchs, which will be made available to the public via online data repositories. By developing a standardized sequencing kit for nudibranchs, the fellow's research facilitates future studies of additional species by other researchers. The fellow is mentoring students from underrepresented groups in science through participation in the host institution's programs designed for minority inclusion in research. These efforts will help prepare students for careers in diverse scientific fields. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project include reconstruction of the relationships among species of nudibranchs, investigation of factors promoting cladogenesis, and establishment of the timing of major diversification events. Methods include generation of transcriptome datasets for identification of loci well suited for targeted enrichment, development of probes, library preparation and Illumina sequencing, and phylogenomic analyses. The relationships established will then inform subsequent analyses to determine the influence various factors, such as aposematic coloration, sexual selection, and dietary specialization have had on radiation events, character evolution, and biogeographical patterns, using software designed to address these questions. The fellow is gaining expertise in phylogenomics of non-model organisms and providing mentorship in molecular lab techniques and bioinformatics to students from groups underrepresented in the sciences."

Through a custom education and outreach package, the development efforts and linkages between technological innovation and biological research will be brought to a broad public audience including potential users of the new instrument, other scientists, public people of all ages, as well as grades 6-12 school children. The outreach package will enhance an existing, standards conforming STEM curriculum, downloadable from a project-specific website. Through addition of a geo-referenced data and information portal to this website (under development via separate funding, to go live in 2016), in combination with regionally available resources (distributed classroom activities kits) and remotely accessible training opportunities, modern science and technology learning opportunities will be brought to under-served rural classrooms in Alaska.<br/> <br/>The purpose of the Life History Transmitter (LHX tag) is to determine survival, causes and locations of mortality of host animals. In female hosts, LHX tags also determine the age at birth of their first pup and the number of pups born over their life. Oceans comprise the majority of the Earth's biosphere, and marine ecosystems are faced with potentially dramatic changes driven by natural and human factors, including use of natural resources and climate change. Many linkages between causes of changes, and effects in complex marine ecosystems, specially those involving top level consumers as well as their predators and prey, remain poorly understood, largely due to a lack of feasible ways to observe many marine species that spend most of their life at sea or under water. To overcome this difficulty, a new monitoring device was developed under previous IDBR funding that enables the collection of predation, survival and female reproductive data by a single instrument, no matter where the host might move to, feed, breed, and die. Building on the success of this new telemetry device that provided the first direct at-sea determination of predation rates on a large marine predator from satellite-linked transmissions initiated only after the death of the host, this project will improve the capabilities and enable the production of the Life History Transmitter, for collaborative studies on many top level species of interest and concern. This will enable researchers from a broad community of potential users to conceive and apply new experimental designs to provide a major surge in our understanding of marine ecosystems, food chain linkages, as well as consumer driven and resource driven effects within the many unresolved knowledge gaps."

Phylogenies too have begun to see application outside of biology in such diverse fields of study as comparative linguistics, anthropology, and forensic science. Meanwhile, the computational environment known as 'R' has developed into one of the leading platforms for scientific computing. The strength of R comes from the literally thousands of contributed function libraries (called ""packages"") developed and distributed for free by computational scientists and developers that are not members of the R core development team. Because of these contributions, R has grown into the preeminent software platform for manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing phylogenetic trees. That said, the capability to actually estimate phylogenetic trees from data in R remains relatively limited. The major objective of this award is to substantially extend the toolkit that is available to undertake phylogeny estimation in the R scientific computing environment. This toolkit will be built using an open development model and will be distributed as a free and open-source resource to the national and international scientific communities. Among the major advantages of developing software for scientific computing in R is that so doing dramatically facilitates scientific reproducibility by allowing all stages of the data analysis pipeline to be built into a single, fully reproducible workflow from open source components.<br/><br/>This research will create new, open-source, and freely distributed software tools that will be of broad utility throughout the phylogenetic scientific community and beyond. The general goal is computational infrastructure development for phylogenetics in R. These investigators will focus on four specific objectives in particular: (1) the development and application of methods to compute distances between trees; (2) the development of new consensus and average tree methods; (3) the development of joint species-tree estimation methods based on likelihood; and, finally, (4) the application of visualization tools for sets of trees and phylogenetic networks. They focus specifically on these research objectives because they interact in particularly interesting ways and because they reflect areas in which substantial research is needed; however, research on these topics will likely result in unanticipated discoveries in fundamentally new areas. The award will also support postdoctoral and graduate training, the latter via an intensive, phylogeny methods boot camp for young developers. This training objective will be undertaken with the aim of helping to form the next generation of computational phylogenetic biologists and will target for participation graduate students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. Phylogenetic tools from this project will be hosted on the CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phytools/index.html<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RMBL recruits students digitally, through its website and the NSF website, as well as through active recruitment by faculty and alumni at colleges and universities throughout the US.  Students are selected based upon financial need, potential impact of the program on the student, scientific promise and demonstrated interest in doing a field project.  RMBL actively works to expand representation in the sciences by prioritizing selection of students of ethnicities that are underrepresented in the sciences. Students are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program is assessed through the REU common assessment tool, as well as data from the longitudinal tracking.

As research deconstruction requires no laboratory infrastructure, it offers a low-cost, scalable approach that may be accessible to a wide variety of institutions, including community colleges.  Engaging students in scientific inquiry is an important strategy for reducing attrition of students from STEM majors, a national problem that threatens the future of the U.S. as a global leader in science and technology.  Providing educators with sustainable options for inquiry-based instruction, particularly at 2-year colleges, may help to increase the number and diversity of future STEM professionals.<br/><br/>External assessment and STEM retention data from implementation over a 10-year period at suggest the approach is effective in teaching students the process of science and increasing persistence in STEM.  To determine the extent to which these educational benefits can be reproduced at a 2-year campus and identify adaptations necessary for implementation in a community college setting, the investigators will work with partner community colleges to develop a pilot research deconstruction course.  Formative assessment will be used to evaluate affective and cognitive learning gains and, in consultation with an advisory team of community college faculty, identify necessary adaptations for a second course offering.  These findings and those of network participants implementing research deconstruction at research universities will be shared at a workshop to identify best practices.  To increase awareness of the pedagogy, local STEM faculty will be invited to the workshop, and video recordings of the presentations will be posted on a website for distribution to the broader education community.  Outcomes from this incubator will inform future efforts as the network is expanded to include more 2- and 4-year colleges.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)."

The center's founding plan requires mutual engagement of social and natural scientists in a facilitated process that leads to joint refinement of synthesis projects and the framing of questions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. This plan is grounded in four key goals: the creation of new coalitions; learning at all levels; expansion and improvement of the synthesis process; and creation of a flexible, adaptive institution. These goals will be achieved through community-driven activities that encourage diverse methods of collaboration including distributed interactions, the use of social media to consolidate collective knowledge from a broad constituency, data visualization, and design charrettes. Through engagement of multiple disciplines in innovative activities, the center promises a fundamental reorganization in how synthesis is accomplished and put into practice. <br/>  <br/>The Center will advance environmental synthesis science by combining diverse perspectives - those from basic research, public policy, science translation, and education. Policy scholars from Resources for the Future, along with policy makers, natural resource managers, and scientists from governmental agencies, will be integral to all center activities. The center presents an unprecedented opportunity to build capacity and broaden participation by advocating synthesis as a process that includes learning at all levels. Students will be trained in the skills needed to carry out synthesis and engaged directly in the synthesis process, with particular focus on hearing- and physically-impaired students, inner-city urban students, non-traditional students, and ethnic minorities. A key aspect of the center's vision is to advance the process of synthesis itself. Through continual evaluation and assessment of center activities and products, and adjustments to center philosophy and management in response to this evaluation, the center will function as a laboratory to facilitate learning about and improving the process of synthesis."

This system will fill needs for rapid, accurate, in-situ measures of important greenhouse gas concentrations and fluxes. The instrument measures concentrations and soil efflux of water vapor, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and the especially potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. Based at Clemson University's Baruch Institute of Coastal Ecology and Forest Science, the system will be deployed in field experiments designed to elucidate the role of sea level rise on coastal wetland ecosystem functioning and potential for feedbacks to climate. It also will be deployed at agricultural research stations across South Carolina to augment research on air and water pollution, fertilizer loss, and sustainable agriculture. This system will allow researchers to generate datasets and science with greatly improved accuracy, applicability, and scalability. The system will be used in projects that include undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers across a diverse team of researchers including women, first-generation college graduates, and underrepresented minorities in science.  The instrument will also be used in new graduate classes that cover wetland ecology, coastal ecology, and biogeochemistry.<br/><br/>Methane and nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases that exert a significant radiative forcing on Earth's climate. Wetlands and agricultural systems are major sources globally, but the mechanisms driving their sources, sinks, and sensitivity to environmental drivers are poorly understood. This gap can be attributed largely to the difficulty in measuring these trace gases at the very low concentrations at which they occur in the environment and by barriers to sampling without artifacts. The acquisition of this soil gas flux measurement system will overcome these obstacles by providing excellent sensitivity and time resolution in a field deployable configuration. An array of multiplexed, automated soil flux chambers will allow for replicate measures of treatments in situ, thus enhancing statistical rigor and the strength of conclusions. Initial use of the system will be to augment ongoing, funded projects that assess the effects of saltwater intrusion on coastal forested wetlands, the rates and types of nitrogen losses from agricultural systems, the effects of restoring impounded wetlands and old rice fields on greenhouse gas emissions, and life cycle analysis of switchgrass production for biofuels.

The station contains 365-ha of primary and secondary forest and one of the most important botanical gardens in Central America. The station's physical location places it at the intersection of natural and human dynamics that are central to tropical environmental science. It is embedded in an agricultural landscape yet has exceptionally high levels of biodiversity due to the rugged topography, the surrounding remnant forest fragments, and its role as part of a biological corridor between two of the most critical conservation areas in Central America: La Amistad International Park and the Osa Peninsula. However, the current lack of adequate infrastructure is a strong limiting factor to ongoing and new lines of research. The Las Cruces planning session will address expansion of station infrastructure to meet current project needs and allow for the modernization and technological improvements that will make the station a hub for research and conservation. The importance of reliable data on a broader range of physical conditions and their temporal behavior is becoming ever more critical to understand the function and dynamics of natural systems. The Las Cruces planning session will assess the opportunities for expansion of environmental monitoring and instrumentation and evaluate associated needs for improved cyberinfrastructure. Finally, upgrades to station facilities will open new lines of research that can be integrated with education and research training opportunities for students. <br/><br/>Las Cruces Research Station currently supports a suite of ongoing projects addressing landscape-level question in biogeography, forest fragmentation, and ecological restoration. The Las Cruces planning session will focus on: (i) potential expansion in current research areas as well as new research directions, especially in environmental sciences, that best utilizes the Las Cruces-Las Alturas biogeophysical setting; (ii) new facilities, laboratory infrastructure, cyberinfrastructure, and equipment needed to support current and emerging areas of research; (iii) key environmental monitoring and instrumentation needed to support existing and emerging research questions; and (iv) integration of this research with education and research training for students. The planning grant will enable sixteen U.S. researchers and graduate students to travel to Las Cruces for a three-day workshop, with overnights in San Jose, Costa Rica, six hours from the station. The planning session will facilitate communication among established scientists as well as graduate and undergraduate students from a range of disciplines and enable new ideas and directions for research in tropical environmental sciences to emerge. Collaboration among these researchers and students at Las Cruces Research Station is expected to result in the development of new, regional multi-disciplinary projects. As such, the Las Cruces planning session will enhance opportunities for underrepresented groups by encouraging collaboration and planning for new education opportunities and hands-on field research projects."

This project builds on expertise available in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community to provide these benefits. The Provenance Aware Synthesis Architecture repository will ensure long-term availability of data and open data access through federations such as DataONE. This system will be expanded in several ways to accommodate a broader community of data providers and users. These enhancements include a scalable user identity management system, improved data documentation procedures to simplify data submission for non-technical users, and expand the data-quality assurance tools to accommodate a broader range of community practices. Training activities will be developed that range from the basics of metadata creation to the adoption of standardized best practices for specific types of data. The development of templates for describing a data lifecycle will accelerate the availability of data for synthesis. The project will leverage the collective experience of the LTER community to improve data management across a broad community through communication and collaboration. It will facilitate shared technology to develop more commonly usable and more efficient approaches to data curation workflows. Participants in training workshops will be trained in developing workflow technology, re-using existing workflows, and archiving and sharing their developments. Through these workshops, together with community-level centers of expertise, and individual-based skill exchanges, the project will increase the volume of data available along with data discoverability and reuse.

Animals face direct threats during migration ranging from severe nutritional stress to potential interactions with wind farms and other anthropogenic hazards. Migration links the geographic endpoints of an animal's life cycle, and patterns of migration determine where and when animals are dependent on habitats that may be threatened or experiencing change due to human activities. Pathways of migration represent potential transmission paths for diseases, parasites, and nutrients carried by migrants. Despite the long-recognized significance of migration, detailed information on migration patterns for most animals is remarkably limited. The field of migration research is poised for major advances due to the development of new technologies and the potential to combine different types of data providing complementary information on animal migration. The ORIGIN project will represent a collaboration between biologists, geochemists, and computer scientists to develop software and database resources allowing researchers to take advantage of one particularly powerful method of reconstructing migration patterns - the use of natural chemical signals preserved in the body tissues of migrants. In the course of this research the ORIGIN team will develop new statistical approaches that are widely useful to scientists and will provide novel interdisciplinary training to graduate students and research opportunities for undergraduates from STEM-underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The goal of the ORIGIN project is to develop data and analytical resources that facilitate major advances in understanding of ecological, evolutionary, physiological, and biogeochemical dimensions of animal migration by increasing the use and standardization of isotope-enabled migration research methods. ORIGIN will consist of two integrated platforms that together provide the data resources, analytical tools, and project support necessary to streamline the analysis of data from migratory animal samples. First, updates to the IsoMAP web-GIS platform will enhance its ability to provide timely, authoritative, and comprehensive map data products and models describing patterns of isotopic variation in the environment. Second, these products will be used by a new package developed for the R programming environment that will provide an accessible but flexible suite of tools supporting 1) analysis of isotopic and non-isotopic data to evaluate the migratory origin of individuals, including two distinct Bayesian approaches for integration of data from multiple makers, 2) planning of isotope-enabled migration research projects, and 3) generation of analytics for assessment of statistical assignment results.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Kojun Kanda is ""Reconstructing global beetle phylogeny one museum at a time: using high-throughput sequencing of museum specimens to resolve relationships between rare taxa."" The host institution for this fellowship is Northern Arizona University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Aaron Smith.  <br/><br/>This goal of this study is to elucidate the evolutionary history and species boundaries in the darkling beetle tribe Asidini (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), using molecular and morphological data from museum specimens. Many species of insects are described from relatively few specimens, thus hindering studies reliant upon DNA sequence data such as evolutionary analyses and identifying cryptic species. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and analysis techniques have opened the door to accessing molecular data in museum specimens, but these tools are not yet regularly applied to studies of the most diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, the insects. Because specimens of this group are extremely rare in collections, the Fellow is using the majority of the world's holdings of Asidini from African, European, North American and South American museums including the Ditsong Museum of South Africa, California Academy of Sciences, and National Museum of Natural History. In addition to elucidating the phylogeny of an important insect group, the Fellow is refining protocols to use molecular data from insect specimens preserved in collections and providing a framework for molecular-based taxonomic and evolutionary studies for rare groups that are reliant upon natural history collections.<br/><br/>The Fellow is being trained in techniques used to acquire DNA sequence data from small museum-preserved insects, such as extracting and sequencing highly degraded DNA, and utilizing bioinformatics techniques to maximize recovery of phylogenetically useful data. Broader impacts to the scientific community include developing protocols and pipelines to help synthesize different data types extracted from museum specimens, including morphology, biogeographic and seasonality information, and molecular sequence data. Additionally, the Fellow is training undergraduates in modern collection-based research techniques by mentoring them in research projects and through collection- and specimen-based courses. A public online portal is also being created to share results of the project with the broader public."

SEM is one of the principal methods for examination of detailed surface structure (micromorphology) of biological materials. This instrument is of fundamental importance to research and training at RSABG, the largest botanic garden dedicated to California native plants and an important research center for plant comparative biology. Specifically, RSABG will acquire a Hitachi SU3500S Variable Pressure SEM, together with specimen preparation equipment and SEM-image analysis software. Vastly improved SEM capabilities will support research by RSABG faculty, staff scientists and students to further our understanding of the evolution of plant diversity through integrating comparative morphological and anatomical research on plants with cutting-edge molecular methods and phylogenetic analysis. The enhanced view of meristems, surfaces of leaves and stems, floral structures, seeds and pollen grains enabled by SEM imaging expands our knowledge of plant form and function. Notably, for many plant groups, SEM photomicrographs of pollen grains are essential components of species descriptions. In addition, quality SEM micrographs are an important means of effective and exciting visual communication, both in scientific presentations and in formal and informal education. SEM imagery from the Hitachi SEM will enhance our work in plant conservation through enhancing our ability to observe reproduction in rare plants. It will also contribute to public and formal education by providing images that are both beautiful and information-packed to support programming for K-6 and college students, as well as other visitors to RSABG through use of such images in exhibits. The facility will also augment microscopy capabilities available to researchers at the Claremont Colleges.<br/><br/>The SU3500S Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope, the Cressington 108 Auto Sputter Coater with an MTM-20 high resolution thickness controller and MountainsMap Universal software represent significant improvements to and expansion of research infrastructure at RSABG. This integrated system will dramatically improve our conventional (i.e., high vacuum) SEM capabilities and also significantly expand our research tool chest by adding (1) higher resolution and magnification than currently achievable, (2) low vacuum capacity and a Peltier cooling stage for observing hydrated, living tissue and (3) sophisticated image analysis software. The low vacuum capabilities of the instrument will expand considerably the research questions that we can address while also ensuring that observations made are accurate. The image analysis software that is a vital part of the package will transform our analytical power to gather data from SEM images: to characterize, quantify and analyze 2D and 3D structure, and to integrate these morphometric data with comparative phylogenetic analyses to advance our knowledge of the patterns of plant evolution."

Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) has helped reveal new insights into the role of tiny connections between cells in the brain.  However, 3DEM has been limited in impact by the rate of data analysis.  This Neurotechnology Hub will improve the 3DEM instrumentation to collect information in greater detail, develop better algorithms to process the information, and link the workflows with high performance computing to greatly increase the rate of knowledge discovery. These innovations and capabilities will be shared with the scientific community through active training on the approach, and through open access to the new software and data. By way of this Neurotechnology Hub, 3DEM will become part of the national infrastructure for neuroscience research. To help address the grand scientific challenge of understanding the brain, this project will apply the improved 3DEM approach across several different mammalian species including humans to identify similarities and differences, and their relationship to behavior, learning, and memory.<br/><br/>This Neurotechnology Hub is motivated by challenges in understanding synapses, the tiny points of inter-neuronal communication. The variance in synapse dimensions, connectivity, and subcellular content across species is simply not known, yet required to determine whether model systems represent human brain functions. Current approaches are limited by resolution, inefficient data collection, and analysis bottlenecks. Addressing these challenges, the project will: (1) Develop simultaneous multi-detector and tilt-tomography on the scanning electron microscope operating in the transmission mode. Add-on hardware and software will improve axial resolution from 45 to 10 nm (or less), while maintaining in-plane resolution of 1-2 nm. (2) Integrate automated and interactive tools that speed and improve analysis of synapses in large data volumes. The enhanced resolution will increase data volume but reduce major image processing difficulties by producing more isotropic images. (3) Integrate the enhanced electron microscopy (EM) with high performance computing to increase throughput; to disseminate images, metadata, analyses, and software in a way that facilitates uptake into existing cell type and brain databases; and to provide a venue to develop 3DEM communities. (4) Apply the new technology to image hippocampus and comparable parts of cortex in mice, rats, and humans.

Important applications include designing drugs and therapeutic agents.  Experimental techniques for determining the interfaces between proteins are expensive and time consuming, so computational structural biologists seek to predict these mathematically. Current prediction methods use a limited number of features hand-crafted by an expert.  An alternate approach is to learn the important features directly from all of the data, using a method called deep neural networks.  This proposal explores a combined approach: use expert intuition for some features but add the power of unsupervised learning with deep neural networks to learn additional, novel features. The results will enrich the way protein structural features are understood in terms of their functional properties, whether those are catalytic sites, protein-binding sites or other sites important to the protein structure. Certainly in the prediction of protein structure itself machine learning scoring methods are showing great promise. Aspects of the research will be used in courses offered through a recently awarded NSF-NRT training grant, The training grant establishes an interdisciplinary program at the interfaces of biology, engineering, math/statistics and computer science.  The program prepares students for a variety of career paths.  Research and education experiences will provide students with valuable expertise in a computational area that is highly valued by top technology firms, such as Google and Facebook, which have research teams exploring the possibilities of deep neural networks.<br/><br/>This work proposes a paradigm shift in the field of protein interface prediction and scoring: from hand-crafted features and standard off-the-shelf classifiers to an approach that augments existing features with automatic learning of the features that characterize the 3-d structures of proteins, combined with the use of learning algorithms that are specifically designed for the characteristics of the problem.  The proposed approach has multiple novel aspects: the proposed learning approach leverages information contained in the entire protein data bank (PDB) to learn features that characterize protein structures at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. It introduces a novel neural network architecture and regularization terms that constrain the solution towards biologically relevant results.  The primary alternative to this machine learning-based interface prediction uses docking simulations; however, current docking energy functions are not accurate enough, so that a near-native solution is often not ranked high enough on the list of outcomes to be useful.  Extensions of the proposed architectures for interface prediction will be employed for re-scoring docking solutions to improve their predictive success. A workflow that integrates docking and machine learning-based interface prediction and scoring is proposed to explore the synergism between these tasks.

The tools will answer the question: what impact will a given (for example, 3°C) climate warming have on organisms and ecological communities?  They will enhance student and public understanding of the biological consequences of climate change and improve the capacity of researchers and managers to predict these biological consequences.  The project will develop and disseminate an interactive web application, Mapping Environmental Stress on Animals (MESA), for visualizing the predicted body temperatures of insects and areas of thermal stress; the incidence of extreme thermal stress events; indicators of development rate, and population growth rate for our focal butterfly and grasshopper species.  The core of MESA will be a biophysical model that budgets heat exchange between insects and the environment. This will address the current inaccessibility of biophysical models, which leads most analyses to approximate body temperatures as air temperatures despite numerous demonstrations that this assumption can lead to incorrect conclusions.  The predictions will be visualized in a Google Earth interface along with photos and vignettes of observed climate impacts on insects such as shifts in phenology.  Users will chose to explore focal grasshopper and butterfly species or choose the size, shape, and coloration of a generic ectotherm to model.  MESA will offer historic and real-time estimates and predictions for future climate change scenarios.  MESA will be prototyped for Colorado and subsequently extended in scope to North America.  This will involve developing high spatial and temporal resolution environmental data for both current and future climates to appropriately quantify how organisms respond to both environmental means and variability.  We will test MESA using historical abundance and distribution data on focal butterfly and grasshopper species.  <br/><br/>The project will develop educational and outreach activities so that students and the public can use the web application to understand how a given amount of warming translates into thermal stress on organisms.  The project will develop a variety of inquiry-based, hands-on education resources to provide high school and undergraduate students with experience visualizing and interpreting thermal stress.  Project personnel will partner with local education initiatives to develop the education modules and will ultimately contribute the modules to national climate change education initiatives.  The modules will follow best practices for broadening participation in science and project personnel will partner with initiatives aimed at recruiting students from underrepresented groups. Students will receive cross training in ecology and computational approaches.  The project will broadly disseminate MESA?s visualizations of thermal stress to agency scientists and through public presentations.  Interfacing with related initiatives such as a phenology visualization tool will leverage the project?s benefits to predicting and planning for the ecological impacts of climate change.

Nonetheless, genetic science is still a long way off from understanding how this exhaustive list of ""parts"" fits together. This project heralds a transformative shift in the basic mathematical approach to understanding how genes interact, by exploiting the fact that gene expression is a temporal and context dependent process.  For example, every person has the genetic coding to produce melatonin; however, its expression varies through the day (keying on genes in the circadian clock) and it is sensitive to environmental factors like light exposure. Thus the temporal sequence and context of expression are important. However, current approaches to understanding variability in expression have relied on non-temporal statistical frameworks based on correlation. They assume that if genes interact, they will always either be positively correlated (simultaneously expressed among all samples) or negatively correlated (expressed only when the other is not) regardless of context or the changing cellular environment. Though a convenient simplification, such correlative approaches are obviously incomplete, and are likely to overlook essential processes such as thresholding, regime shifts, and gene check-pointing that specifically arise from dynamic, context-dependent behavior. This project will investigate empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an emerging framework that explicitly accounts for both the context and temporal sequence of expression events. The work will be a mixture of proof-of-principle and application to a cell differentiation pathway in mice associated with breast cancers. Development of EDM will provide an important complement to current approaches, with the capability to dramatically increase the efficacy of bioinformatics and systems biology research, and to reveal important regulatory hubs of genes that are non-correlated and thus invisible to current approaches.<br/><br/>This project will investigate and further develop empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a conceptual framework to identify causal interactions among genes and produce mechanistic understanding that can be validated by prediction. As an approach that accommodates the reality of natural (non-engineered) nonlinear (context-dependent) interconnected systems, EDM is well-suited to leverage temporally-explicit genomic datasets that have only recently become feasible. In the first phase, the approach will be applied to construct gene interaction networks during the yeast (S. cerevisiae) cell cycle to explore how an explicitly nonlinear and dynamic approach can reveal information that is hidden to current analytical methods. Building on this, the second phase will seek to develop and implement an EDM approach (static cross-map) to single cell data that necessarily lack an explicit time sequence. The approach will be developed and tested on computational models of gene circuits, then applied to single cell data obtained from a stem-cell differentiation sequence in mice. Work will be validated by comparison to existing ontologies and by tailored experiments to be carried out by a collaborating lab at The Salk Institute.

To date, over 1,000 species have been discovered in this remarkable amber. Scientific study of Dominican amber began with an NSF-funded expedition by Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) entomologist Milton Sanderson, who visited the island in 1959 to study beetles. Having learned of rich amber deposits he set out to find them with the help of local guides and collected a large sample that he brought back to the INHS. The following year he published a short paper reporting his discovery, thereby kickstarting scientific study of this ancient ecosystem. Sanderson's collection is therefore, tremendously important both scientifically and historically, yet remains unstudied, still unsorted and unprocessed in the original five-gallon buckets in which it was collected. Years of substandard storage has taken its toll on the amber, which has undergone significant oxidation and is now incredibly fragile. This project will allow the collection to finally be screened for inclusions, conserved using state-of-the-art resin embedding techniques, curated, and digitized. This will unlock a wealth of important data concerning ancient biodiversity, ecology, and climate that is currently hidden and inaccessible within the collection.  In addition to making this data available to the scientific community and the public for the first time, it will also provide valuable experience to graduate and undergraduate students beginning their careers in science.<br/><br/>The Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) at the University of Illinois is home to the Milton Sanderson Dominican Amber Collection (MSDAC).  In addition to its historical importance as the first substantial collection of Dominican amber, the MSDAC is hugely significant scientifically.  It comprises a large (ca. 70 kg) bulk sample of amber that remains almost entirely unprocessed; i.e., it still resides in the five-gallon buckets in which it was collected and has yet to be screened for fossils.  Aside from its size, the unscreened nature of the collection means that it has not been subject to collector bias and no inclusions have been discarded, as typically happens in collections made commercially and sold to museums or private collectors.  As a result, the MSDAC presents a unique opportunity to study an unbiased collection that promises to deliver a more complete picture of the paleobiodiversity and paleoecology of the Early Miocene Dominican amber forest. Unfortunately, decades of substandard storage have resulted in substantial oxidation damage putting the collection at significant risk. This project will focus on the stabilization, conservation, curation and digitization of the MSDAC. A state-of-the-art vacuum resin embedding technique, in which specimens are embedded in a high-quality synthetic resin, will be used to stabilize the oxidized amber. Trimming and polishing of stabilized specimens will allow identification of inclusions and facilitate photomicrography of specimens for inclusion in an online database. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in every step of the process, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It enables experiments that would otherwise be physically impossible, allows for testing under rigorously controlled conditions, and is an essential technique for ensuring reproducibility in the scientific process. In protein evolution, simulation is the key to understanding processes that act on time scales that exceed a human life span. Twenty years of research have produced a rich repertoire of algorithms and software for simulating protein sequence evolution. However, current models do not capture the processes by which multidomain proteins evolve. Multidomain proteins are mosaics of sequence fragments that encode protein modules: structural or functional units called domains. Because of their modular nature, multidomain proteins play central roles in cellular communication with other cells and with the environment. In human health, multidomain families are implicated in tissue repair, apoptosis, inflammation response, and innate immunity. Since roughly 30% of bacterial proteins and 50% of vertebrate proteins contain two or more domains, the critical benefits of simulation currently cannot be exploited for at least a third of all proteins on this planet.<br/><br/>This project addresses this gap through the design and implementation of software for simulating multidomain evolution. This project advances research infrastructure through the development and distribution of the first evolutionary simulator for multidomain proteins. This project also contributes to building a broadly inclusive scientific work force through research experiences for undergraduates and classroom teaching. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited from women in Carnegie Mellon's undergraduate program and from groups that are underrepresented in STEM through educational activities at the University of Puerto Rico. Simulation is an essential technique in molecular evolution, where the processes of interest typically act on the time scales that are beyond the reach of human endeavor. Simulation is essential for comparison and validation of evolutionary algorithms and software, for evaluating competing hypotheses, and for assessing how a system will respond to perturbations. Despite the growth of sophisticated methodology for simulating the evolution of amino acid sequences, no simulators currently exist that model the process of domain insertion, duplication, and deletion by which multidomain protein families evolve. Although these processes have the potential to generate any combination of domains, only a tiny fraction of possible domain combinations are observed in nature, suggesting that domain order and co-occurrence are stringently constrained. The goal of this project is the development of algorithms and prototype software for multidomain simulation based on realistic models of these constraints. This simulator benefits from a novel combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo technology and data-driven estimates of event probabilities. The data-driven event module enables quick and easy redeployment of the simulator for use in different taxonomic and protein function contexts. Repeated cycles of empirical testing and simulator redesign will promote better understanding of nature's protein design principles, more precise models and methods, and more accurate evolutionary inferences. The resulting software will be available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/_durand/Lab/multidomain.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microbes evolve under the pressure of environmental stresses, such as climate change and pollution; these changes have global impact. For both microbes and their communities (or microbiomes), understanding the consequences of large-scale changes on microbes requires that we understand their starting point under normal conditions. In this project, normal baselines will be defined showing the functional abilities of microbes in a community and environment. Microbes will be grouped into similar functional classes, the 'distance' between two classes will include all of the differences in their functional abilities, which indicates their lifestyle preferences under existing conditions. In this way, a microbial class becomes a small set of shared functions, and is the basis for a novel way to infer microbial and microbiome diversity. The shared functions will serve as a guide to discovering new functional pathways or new members of known pathways, which can lead to broader impacts in a number of industrial applications.

Using this similarity metric, a new classification scheme will be built, defining microbial clades according to their functional capacities. This scheme will be reflective of heredity as well as other forms of genetic transfer and of environmental factors. This will also provide an opportunity to explore the influence of inheritance versus horizontal gene transfer in acquiring new functions. Based on the consistent co-occurrence of functions in microorganisms, common molecular pathways and minimal pathways required for life within specific environmental niches will be elucidated. The power of this approach is its ability to assign proteins to pathways that remain experimentally uncharacterized. Overlaying available annotations of microorganism habitat preferences (e.g. temperature, oxygen requirements, and pH), broadly explains metabolic end-points and unique environmental adaptations. The newly developed tools will be used to describe niche-specific microbiomes for precise analysis of the environmental effects, whether in natural processes or for synthetic function design and industrial process optimization. The specific goals of the project include: (i) develop a function-based organism similarity metric, facilitating a functional clade definition, (ii) identify core sets of functions most discriminative of clade assignment and, thus, most descriptive of environment requirements and (iii) enable fast and accurate metagenome diversity and functional ability analysis. All tools and other resources will be publicly accessible at www.bromberglab.org/services. Students will be included in formulating relevant scientific questions and trained in methods for answering them through the building, evaluating, and applying computational methods. Two postdocs will be trained to conduct this research and in educational methods for leading an associated course, the first bioinformatics methods design course at this institution. Undergraduate students will (i) acquire skills in quantitative biology for which (ii) impact will be measured for both understanding of bioinformatics and perception of research as a whole. The postdocs will assist in outreach activities at a New York City high school and at Genspace - New York City's community biolab."

CRMs play critical roles with respect to normal variation between individuals, birth defects, chronic diseases, and evolution. Despite the clear importance for many areas of biology, these sequences are not well-documented. The REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database helps fill this gap in CRM annotation by curating known CRMs and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for the important research organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). REDfly is the most detailed existing platform for regulatory element annotation for any animal. It's records include over 16,000 experimentally verified CRMs and 2000 TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the gene expression patterns they direct. REDfly is a well-used and valuable resource for the genomics, bioinformatics, and Drosophila communities and is an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research. It has contributed to numerous studies in multiple areas relating to non-Drosophila as well as Drosophila systems including CRM biology, CRM discovery, construction of regulatory network models, interpretation of genomic datasets, and CRM evolution. The current project will focus on continued curation and maintenance of the database so that it remains up to date and functions with maximum utility for its users. This will ensure that REDfly continues to be available as an important source of raw data for analysis, hypothesis generation, assessment and validation, and empirical research in molecular and developmental biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and evolution. The current project also has a valuable undergraduate education component. It will continue to be the focus of a University at Buffalo course ""Genome Annotation"", in which the students participate in annotating regulatory elements for entry into REDfly, thus making genuine contributions to the research community while learning the techniques of genome annotation and biocuration and the science of gene regulation. In a new effort, a REDfly unit will be introduced into a Developmental Biology course at Baruch College-CUNY, one of the nation's most diverse campuses. Students who excel in the class will be invited to Buffalo to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and serve as REDfly curators.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this Sustaining Award are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being discovered and reported in the literature, and to maintain the REDfly site in a manner that will maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will be kept up - to - date as new studies are published. Emphasis will remain on in vivo assays, but in vitro studies will be included where encountered and appropriate. (2) Education. The PI will continue to use REDfly as the basis for his ""Genome Annotation"" course. A REDfly unit will be introduced in an undergraduate course at Baruch College-CUNY, and bring up to two course alumni to Buffalo each summer to work on REDfly curation as a part of the University at Buffalo Medical School's Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (SURE) program. (3) Service. REDfly will continue to serve its user community with a high degree of responsiveness, including rapid response to queries, custom searches and downloads on request, error correction, and support for undergraduate courses. (4) General maintenance. REDfly will be maintained in peak operating condition through identification and correction of programming bugs, regular updates to genome annotations imported from FlyBase and other sources, active maintenance of links to outside resources, software and/or hardware updates, etc. These activities will ensure that REDfly data continue to be available as an important resource for the scientific community.

Gene transcriptional regulation refers to any process by which a cell regulates its genes expression. Properly regulated expression of genes is crucial for ensuring that biological processes are accurately carried out, for genes contributing to development, proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), aging, and differentiation. Gene expression begins when mRNA molecules start to be synthesized, at the point on the gene where they initiate. To understand the regulation of gene expression, it is essential to discover the transcription initiation mechanisms under various conditions, and how these varied mechanisms lead to different outcomes, or phenotypes. High throughput sequencing of complete RNA sets synthesized in cells has produced large datasets, but matching large-scale computational studies, to understand phenotype-relevant transcription initiation mechanisms are still at its early stage. This project will study transcription initiation and gene regulation, with the goal of generating computational algorithms that capture the rules and conditions for selection of the transcription initiation site on a gene; the algorithms will then be converted into software tools. These tools will be released as open-source and freely available software packages to the scientific community and interested public. The research will be communicated in ways expected to have a great impact on education at many levels: it will be incorporated into lectures, labs, and research opportunities geared towards graduate, undergraduate and K-12 education. The research will also be disseminated to the research community and the public to enhance scientific understanding, through freely distributed computational tools and various modes of web dissemination. In addition, mentoring and outreach efforts targeted towards women and girls will help attract more women into engaging in research experiences in interdisciplinary science. <br/><br/>Understanding the underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of gene transcription initiation is important to understand gene regulation. The project seeks to create a set of computational algorithms and statistical methods to discover the associations between transcription initiation and gene regulation mechanisms towards advancing our understanding of gene transcriptional regulation. The advanced graph theory-based algorithms and probabilistic models of gene transcription initiation and regulation through large-scale high-throughput transcriptomics, genomics and epigenomics data integration have the promise to unveil various transcription initiation mechanisms and their functional roles in gene transcriptional regulation and phenotype formulation. The research is expected to not only advance scientific understanding of global gene regulation and phenotype development, but also stimulate interest in developing and advancing efficient computational modeling and data integration methods in the informatics research field. The research information and products will be made available through the project website (http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/TransInitiation/)."

A commercial transportation company will pack and move the entire ULM fish collection to TUBRI.  The ULM specimens document the natural heritage of Louisiana and surrounding regions and can provide valuable insight into understanding critical environmental issues affecting the region and the nation, including documenting invasive species, changes affecting water resources, wetlands loss, and ocean acidification.<br/><br/>Roughly 13% of the jars of specimens in the ULM fish collection were donated to ULM by Louisiana Tech University in 1999, but were never cataloged in the ULM fish collection database.  Data for these lots will be entered into the ULM database, specimen counts will be added to the database for jars missing this information, and curatorial needs of jars (added alcohol, replacement lids) will be met. Once all this work is completed, curators of fish collections at Louisiana State University, Southeastern Louisiana University, Arkansas State University, the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science and University of Texas, Austin, will be sent data for specimens from their states and other geographic areas, and the curators will be asked to approve material destined to be sent to them.

The nonprofit Osa Conservation has been dedicated to protecting this unique ecosystem for over 14 years. With a new research facility and capabilities, the Osa Verde Biological Station (OVBS), which is owned and operated by Osa Conservation, will dramatically increase the number and type of researchers, while improving the quality and integration of research projects to advance scientific knowledge about the region's ecosystems and tropical habitat conservation. Clientele at the OVBS over the past ten years has included university and high school groups (largely from the US), international researchers, volunteer citizen scientists, and serious naturalists from across the globe. Station usage by education groups has increased steadily over the past 5 years and is expected to continue growing. The new lab will meet the needs of both the increasing number of US education groups and the high-level US researchers from a diversity of subdisciplines that will ultimately produce higher quality projects. By becoming a premier field station in Costa Rica, OVBS will not only advance scientific knowledge about tropical ecology and expand scientific literacy, but also expand collaboration between international researchers, education groups, stakeholders, and decision makers. Applied conservation impact from the OVBS strategic research agenda are vital to conserving this important biodiverse region in perpetuity. <br/><br/>Support from NSF will transform the ability of OVBS to successfully draw in a cadre of committed researchers and educators who will become career-long users for their investigation and teaching needs, all while contributing to the body of scientific knowledge that will inform conservation. With greater research capabilities for both scientists and education groups, OVBS will significantly further its five main research areas of: 1) Wildlife Population Monitoring; 2) Tropical Reforestation and restoration techniques; 3) Rewilding and enhancement techniques; 4) Ecological and behavioral studies; and 5) Ecosystem process and function studies. To advance this research agenda, funding from NSF will 1) create a dedicated laboratory building, with both a wet and dry lab; 2) improve electrical power and communications for the laboratory; and 3) purchase and install basic lab equipment that is expected of visiting researchers and student groups. A dedicated lab space will facilitate planning, storage, analysis and training space for innovative research, much of which uses modern technologies and scientific equipment that requires careful controlled storage. These additions will allow for better processing of region-wide remote sensing data, provide better management and storage facilities of the collected data, as well as offer space for regular training courses. The success of research-led conservation efforts at OVBS will become a model for how emerging scientists, established researchers and conservation practitioners can collaboratively bridge field and laboratory research to advance science-driven conservation outcomes.

The core component of PhenoNet is a set of PhenoBots; lightweight robots that are able to autonomously navigate between crop rows using GPS and local range sensors while employing advanced sensing technologies to phenotype crop plants. The PhenoBots can measure indicators such as stalk size, plant height, leaf angle and tassel/inflorescence properties over time. The robots will be optimized for maize research and can be easily adapted for other row crops. The network (PhenoNet) is a universal platform which enables comprehensive field-based research on genotype and environment interactions. The broader impacts of this project are threefold. First, PhenoNet will have an important impact on society as understanding genome X environment interactions will help address the need for sufficient food, feed, and fiber for the planet's growing population, which is vital in an ever-changing environment. PhenoNet will bring ""big data"" more deeply into agriculture by cementing connections between plant scientists and engineers in their efforts to reach this goal. Second, this project is synergistic with the NSF-NRT project, ""Predictive Phenomics of Plants"", recently awarded to Iowa State University. The research and engineering outlined in this Major Research Instrumentation project will provide an outstanding opportunity for students from engineering disciplines, computer science, statistics, and agronomy to collaborate and engage in state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research. This project will also advance the training of current engineers and plant scientists who are experienced with networking, robotics and agronomy. Third, this project will reach out to underrepresented groups by targeting minority-serving institutions for student recruitment and will work with the Society of Women Engineers and other similar groups in seeking women participants to help meet the NSF-NRT award's efforts to broaden participation. <br/><br/>The PhenoBots are an important and essential advancement in the fields of agriculture and technology because they more efficiently characterize tall plants over time to their maturity. Previous technology and platforms are either incapable of, or are greatly hindered by various constraints. The design improvements of the Phenobots enable the robots to be more robust, stable, lightweight, integrated and economical. This creates a pathway for transformative research as it enables in situ, non-invasive monitoring of the traits of tall crops, like maize, over time. PhenoNet will consist of a network of four PhenoBots, which will be deployed by plant scientists in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. The data generated from high throughput phenotyping will address whether it is possible to predict the phenotype of a given genotype in a specified environment."

This system is based on the Nobel-prize winning concept of the optical frequency comb and is hereby called an ""agro-comb"". The most critical agricultural challenge is to double crop production by 2050 to meet surging world food demand. To do so, plant, soil and environmental scientists need accurate data on the concentrations of multiple agriculturally significant gases at relevant time and spatial scales. Such data are indispensable for applications such as crop breeding, nutrient management, crop water use, and livestock gas emission monitoring. The agro-comb will support a collaborative group of interdisciplinary users from Kansas State University and throughout the United States and Canada. Broader impacts of this project include the training of young researchers in this highly interdisciplinary research area. Important societal outcomes also include potentially commercial technology which could widely influence precision agriculture management, breeding programs, and other areas. Project scientists will team up with existing University outreach programs to offer summer research opportunities to undergraduate students and hands-on activities for middle-school children, particularly girls. Furthermore, they will present related science to children throughout Kansas via a traveling lecture series, among other outreach activities.<br/><br/>The agro-comb is a mid-infrared laser system for the simultaneous measurement of multiple trace gas concentrations with high sensitivity over a 10 m path. The intellectual merit of the research is the sensitive detection of agriculturally relevant gases in the field, with the unprecedented combination of speed, spectral width, and sensitivity that dual-comb spectroscopy offers. The agro-comb's broadband but discrete nature will permit the high-resolution detection of carbon dioxide and water, including forms that incorporate deuterium, carbon-13, and oxygen-16 isotopes, with a single open-path instrument. Such simultaneous measurements, never before possible, are key to understanding the carbon and water cycles by improving knowledge of photosynthesis, soil respiration and evaporation, and plant transpiration. These measurements can be made over individual sub-plots of different crop varieties, to expand the ability to connect a plant's traits to its genetic composition. The agro-comb will also be used to detect important gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, and ammonia, which can be used to monitor gaseous losses of nitrogen from soils and methane emissions from feedlots."

The challenge lies in the high-dimensional gene variables and the complexity of gene regulation and interactions that collectively define particular phenotypes (also called traits). The project will develop innovative methods, tools and bioinformatics systems to decipher the plant G2P associations through integrative genome-scale biological network and genome-wide association analysis. A breakthrough in this work will lead to a systems-level understanding of how biological processes, pathways and complex traits in plants are hierarchically regulated. Advancing such fundamental knowledge will greatly benefit modern genome-assisted plant breeding by providing the underlying regulatory mechanisms and key regulators of agriculturally important traits.

Cutting-edge technologies will be developed to study G2P associations in plants, providing excellent opportunities for training undergraduates, graduates and postdocs in interdisciplinary fields such as computational biology, bioinformatics, plant genomics, and statistical genetics, at the three institutes. Underrepresented minorities and women will be especially targeted in the recruitment of the project. The research will form the basis of the proposed educational workshops centering on bioinformatics and statistical genetics. Creative and innovative hands-on outreach activities will be arranged through the three institutes? outreach programs with local K-12 schools to inspire young minds to become bioinformatics scientists. <br/><br/>Innovative methods will be developed to analyze genome-scale biological networks and genome-wide associations through a fully integrated bioinformatics platform, enabling the discovery of G2P associations in plants.

Complex phenotypes characterized by a variety of features are often associated with substantial phenotypic variation. Current statistical methods are ineffective to address this phenotypic heterogeneity, and hence lack of power to associate genetic variants with the phenotype. This project aims to design new algorithms that differentiate homogenous subtypes of a complex phenotype that are most informative in genetic analysis, and identify genetic variants that are associated with the subtypes but cannot be detected by the non-differentiated phenotype. The validity of the subtypes will be proved in multiple scales including the evidence from genomic structure and phenotypic features. The new algorithms will be validated in the areas of genetic selection for complex traits of agriculturally-important animals and plants. This project serves a vehicle to train graduate students in the multidisciplinary methods involving computer science and biology, and allow them to apply the methods in a variety of biological fields. A new course in the bioinformatics field will be developed for senior undergraduate students. High school educational materials will also be developed to educate high school students about how to mathematically model biological data so it solves biological problems.<br/><br/>This project will derive novel analytics based on quantitative genetics theory and machine learning theory to refine complex phenotypes for enhanced discovery of genotype-phenotype correlations. Using empirical and statistically rigorous methods, this project will derive composite traits, as functions of multiple phenotypic features, that are optimized with respect to narrow-sense heritability, and that map readily to specific genomic regions. Two statistical models for estimating narrow-sense heritability will be considered: one based on sample pedigrees, and the other directly uses the whole-genome markers. To identify multi-scale evidence of a subtype that is characterized by a composite trait, a new machine learning framework will be derived to jointly analyze genotypes and phenotypes. By testing the algorithms in the analysis of large-scale biological databases, the new algorithms will derive highly heritable composite traits for feed efficiency of dairy cattle and adaptive traits of soybean to improve their genetic selection. The algorithms developed in this project will also advance the machine learning field by defining and addressing new research problems, such as the joint model inference using data from multiple sources, probabilistic clustering based on matrix decomposition, and quadratic optimization for heritability estimation. This project will yield user-friendly software tools that can be broadly deployed to biological research areas that study genetics of complex phenotypes.

The increasing availability of experimentally elucidated metabolic pathways together with the availability of enzyme functional data have ignited research in metabolic engineering and metabolomics. Recently, metabolic engineering has facilitated the production of complex pharmaceutical molecules by combining and manipulating metabolic pathways from multiple organisms. Metabolomic studies have revealed underlying causes of complex diseases and have helped diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment regimens as these evolve toward more individualized protocols. These spectacular advances have mostly relied upon laborious manual processes that are infeasible as more and more metabolic data are generated. The ability of the algorithms that will developed herein to discover known pathways will be investigated thoroughly and will include wetlab experimentation with two model studies. The studies involve niacin and shikonin, two therapeutic agents. Computational and wetlab experimentation will be conducted in parallel, with the computation feeding the experiment and the experiment providing valuable feedback for the tuning of the parameters of the corresponding algorithms. A web server will be built to facilitate the use of our tools and to widely disseminate our work in the scientific community.    <br/><br/>The research is timely and directed toward an important area of broad scientific interest with implications extending to fields such as health and energy. The project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. Participation in this type of research will provide graduate students with interdisciplinary training in metabolic engineering, metabolomics, systems biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology, as well as in mathematical modeling, algorithms, and computer science. The project will provide training opportunities and mentoring for women and minority graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.

Founded in 1858, UIMNH is the oldest US university museum west of the Mississippi River, and it remains the only museum of its kind in the state.  Its holdings represent more than a century of biological collecting in Iowa, the Midwest, and around the world, and are of historical and ecological importance.  The ornithology collection is among the largest and best-documented, with approximately 13,880 bird and 17,220 egg and nest specimens, many from the Midwest before large-scale agriculture and urbanization drastically changed the landscape. This collection is an important and irreplaceable resource for modern scientific studies, including research on the effects of land-use and climate change, introduced and invasive species, and modern agricultural practices.  This upgrade will improve conditions, alleviate overcrowding, and generally secure and stabilize the collection, ensuring its continued availability while increasing access for scientists and students.  The project will provide training and development opportunities for several undergraduate students.  It will also include the development of public exhibit components on the use of museum collections in modern scientific research, to be displayed both at UIMNH and in the traveling UI Mobile Museum. <br/><br/> <br/>The project's major activity will be the installation of a compactor storage system and new cabinets in one room of Macbride Hall, the 1907 building housing UIMNH. Consolidating and rehousing the ornithology collection in this single area will allow more efficient use of space and taxonomic reorganization, and will greatly improve access by staff and visitors. This upgrade will bring the entire ornithology collection into an environmentally controlled room for the first time in its history.  As part of the upgrade and rehousing process, all specimens will be georeferenced.  Scientifically and historically important specimens will be photographed, increasing the amount of digital data available for the collection.  The bases of public exhibit cases that currently contain research specimens will be transformed into a combination of interactive exhibits for children and ""visible storage,"" introducing museum visitors to the research collections and their role in modern science.  In addition, a digital touchscreen module on collections-based research will be added to the UI Mobile Museum (http://discover.research.uiowa.edu/mobile-museum).  All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.

The challenge lies in the high-dimensional gene variables and the complexity of gene regulation and interactions that collectively define particular phenotypes (also called traits). The project will develop innovative methods, tools and bioinformatics systems to decipher the plant G2P associations through integrative genome-scale biological network and genome-wide association analysis. A breakthrough in this work will lead to a systems-level understanding of how biological processes, pathways and complex traits in plants are hierarchically regulated. Advancing such fundamental knowledge will greatly benefit modern genome-assisted plant breeding by providing the underlying regulatory mechanisms and key regulators of agriculturally important traits. This in turn will have great potential to be translated into new means of improving plant quality and production for agriculture, thus benefiting society as a whole. Cutting-edge technologies will be developed to study G2P associations in plants, providing excellent opportunities for training undergraduates, graduates and postdocs in interdisciplinary fields such as computational biology, bioinformatics, plant genomics, and statistical genetics, at the three institutes. Underrepresented minorities and women will be especially targeted in the recruitment of the project. The research will form the basis of the proposed educational workshops centering on bioinformatics and statistical genetics. Creative and innovative hands-on outreach activities will be arranged through the three institutes? outreach programs with local K-12 schools to inspire young minds to become bioinformatics scientists. <br/><br/>Innovative methods will be developed to analyze genome-scale biological networks and genome-wide associations through a fully integrated bioinformatics platform, enabling the discovery of G2P associations in plants. Specific aims of the project include 1) to develop novel top-down and bottom-up graphical Gaussian model (GGM) algorithms to reconstruct the hierarchical gene networks that control biological processes and pathways; 2) to develop models and algorithms that enable large-scale marker-trait association analysis with high precision using novel statistical genetics approaches; and 3) to develop a Graph-search-empowered integrative bioinformatics platform to facilitate the integration, deciphering and discovery of G2P associations. To validate our approaches and tools, public data from genome-wide plant 'omics' studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) will be integrated and analyzed, associating traits with SNP markers and fine-tuning the prediction of phenotype-associated hierarchical and/or pleiotropic regulators and functional networks.

Manter Laboratory of Parasitology (HWML) at the University of Nebraska is an international biological resource that supports research and education in ecology, biological diversity, and infectious disease.  Housing millions of specimens from all continents and oceans, the HWML is a hub for the study of parasites, and enables scientists to make biological predictions, such as how environmental change might affect parasite distributions, which can impact human health, agriculture, forestry and other societal interests.  This collection also serves as educational resources to make scientific research accessible to the public through virtual field trips and museum exhibitions.  This project aims to secure and make digitally available two recently acquired parasite collections, and to purchase a new freezer to house the HWML's frozen tissue collection of parasites from wild animals, the largest worldwide.  This award will enable the HWML to continue to serve as an international resource in parasitology and will also support research opportunities in the collections for undergraduate students and local science teachers, and the development of biodiversity teaching resources.<br/><br/>The HWML's mission is to conduct and support research in parasite systematics, taxonomy, and biodiversity; foster studies in parasite biodiversity; provide state-of-the-art laboratory facilities and resources for parasite genomic, genetic, and phylogenetic research; and promote long-term conservation and utilization of parasite specimens in the laboratory's care. This project will complete full integration of two recently acquired collections into the HWML's holdings: the Hopla flea collection, which contains more than 300 species of fleas worldwide, and the Gettinger collection, a collection of ectoparasites from Paraguay that includes host-parasite data from several thousand mammals. Funding will also allow the HWML to replace a currently failing freezer in the Parasite Genomic Research Facility, thus securing long-term storage for the largest frozen tissue collection of parasites from wild animals anywhere.  These collections will be digitized and made available via Arctos, an online database for biodiversity and natural history collections, and shared with iDigBio (iDigBio.org).  Researchers worldwide will be able to access and analyze new parasite data to gain insight into biological diversity, species rates, and general evolutionary processes.  Finally, funding will support research opportunities in the HWML for undergraduates and Nebraska teachers and the development of resources to support educators in teaching about biodiversity.  The expected outcome is that scientists will have improved capability to understand, anticipate, and respond to the outcomes of accelerating environmental change, and to leverage museum occurrence records to estimate geographic ranges of parasites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DNA sequencing costs and throughput have improved by orders of magnitudes over the last three decades, although many questions remain unsolved, especially because of the short sequence lengths currently available. Emerging ""third generation"" sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences, Moleculo, Oxford Nanopore, and other companies are poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. The sequence lengths with these technologies can reach up to tens of thousands of nucleotides, however few or no analysis packages are capable of dealing with these types of genetic sequence data. This project will overcome these limitations by developing several novel analysis algorithms specifically for long read single molecule sequencing and their associated complex error models. The outcomes will help answer biological questions of profound significance to all of society, such as: What were the genetic implications of the domestication of rice? What genes and regulatory elements give rise to the incredible regenerative properties of the flatworm? or, What can be understood from assembling reference genomes of sugarcane and pineapple towards breeding more robust plant crops and biofuels?<br/><br/>Specific objectives of the research include working towards assembling entire plant and animal chromosomes into complete, haplotype-phased sequences; identifying fusion genes and complex alternative splicing patterns responsible for diseases or adaptability; and searching for structural variations associated with improved crop yield or human diseases such as cancer or autism. Even if some future technology is capable of directly reading entire transcripts or entire genomes, this research will remain necessary to examine the higher level relationships across populations of genomes or in measuring the dynamics of gene expression and splicing.<br/><br/>This project will tightly integrate research and education, promoting opportunities at high school through postdoctoral levels with the development of new course materials, hands-on research opportunities, and one-on-one mentoring experiences. This effort will specifically target the intersection of computer science and biology, promoting interdisciplinary education, and ensuring the next generation of scientists are ready for the complexities of quantitative and digital biology. To engage the widest possible audience, Dr Schatz  will also develop novel online teaching materials made available through a yearly bioinformatics contest. The first round of the contest reached nearly 1000 students around the world and at all levels of education, engaging students far beyond our physical limits.

The fellow is being mentored by the following sponsoring scientists: Simon Levin (Princeton University), Stacy Philpott (University of California Santa Cruz), and Brenda Lin (CSIRO- Australia). Urban agriculture provides food security, biodiversity, greenspace and educational opportunities to underrepresented groups in science, yet urban landscapes are in constant flux, with parcels frequently transitioning between vacant lots, urban gardens and developed land. This research explores past and future patterns of land-use change in urban areas, the role of socio-economic and ecological factors in driving change, and how land-use change influences biodiversity and ecosystem function. The fellow is participating in multidisciplinary collaborations that will advance her work at the intersection of theoretical, landscape and urban ecology. The project addresses why transitions to urban agriculture are more permanent in some cases than others, and results will be shared with community members who are seeking land-tenure for urban gardens in gentrifying neighborhoods. <br/><br/>The fellow is receiving training in socio-ecological theory through collaborations with the sponsoring scientists, and is developing a spatially-explicit dynamic model of land-use transitions as a function of the net socio-ecological costs associated with the direction and frequency of transitions between land-use states. The model is also being fit with socio-ecological data from urban gardens, future land-use changes are being predicted, and results are compared to past patterns observed for large, urban counties of California using historical aerial imagery. Historical land-use change is being categorized into dynamic types ranging from critical to smooth, and transition type regressed against data on pest and natural enemy biodiversity in urban gardens to understand its impact on biological control. Broader impacts and broadening participation efforts target youth from working-class families that use urban agriculture for food subsistence and are directly influenced by the land-use change resulting from gentrification of their neighborhoods. These individuals are participating in workshops focused on the socio-ecological drivers and consequences of land-use transitions for biological control services in their own neighborhoods.

The goal of the project is to develop a FAST P3D-STED microscope (fast acquisition, photoactivation, 3-dimensional enhanced resolution STED microscope).  Historically, light microscopy has been limited in its resolution by the Diffraction Barrier - a fundamental physical limit due to the property of photons of spreading out when they pass by an edge, such as the aperture in a microscope. In the past decade, several methods have emerged that can ""break"" the diffraction barrier, causing a revolution in the field of biological imaging and opening a major window of opportunity for studies that heretofore have been impossible. STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, invented by Stefan Hell, is one such super-resolution technique, allowing fluorescence imaging at resolutions of tens of nanometers. With continuing improvements in the technology, STED is now able to be utilized with a wide range of fluorescent dyes and genetically encoded fluorophores and has advantages for fast, live cell, and in vivo imaging. The investigators will further push the current capabilities of STED microscopy by developing a new STED microscope to allow high speed, sub-diffraction limit imaging combined with photoactivation capabilities. This microscope will allow researchers to not only observe small objects with sub-diffraction resolution, but also enable control of dynamic processes and observation in real time.<br/>The projects enabled by the instrument include studies of the dynamic organization of protein complexes in synapses upon control of neural plasticity, studies of the molecular-level mechanisms of odor transduction by direct stimulation of the transduction pathway, and methods for writing/reading bits at sub-diffraction dimensions in high density data storage materials. The potential societal impacts of this research include improved treatment of neurological disorders and advances in information handling and storage. The FAST P3D STED microscope will be housed in the Advanced Light Microscopy Core (ALMC) facility at the University of Colorado Denver, a successful shared user facility that has personnel and resources to train new users and operate and maintain the instrument.  Researchers, postdoctoral trainees, and students from a variety of science and engineering departments at the University of Colorado Denver, University of Colorado Boulder and other universities will be able to utilize the microscope for their research. Outreach to new users will be accomplished through seminars put on by the ALMC and research presentations at scientific meetings.  The investigators are particularly committed to promoting student training and advancing participation of under-represented minorities in science as evidenced by their involvement in the Building Research Achievement in Neuroscience (BRAiN) program, a summer program designed to help meet the challenge to reduce the Neuroscience research participation gap by preparing diverse undergraduates in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Region for successful entry to Neuroscience Ph.D. programs.  The capability of the STED microscope to see the inner workings of cells at unprecedented resolution captures the imagination of these future scientists."

NGS technologies have revolutionized the biological sciences and until now have, for the most part, been sheltered from undergraduate research and teaching institutions. Acquisition of the MiSeq will immediately improve the teaching infrastructure of all involved institutions. The MiSeq system will in effect impact ethnically diverse students both in the classroom and in field/laboratory -based research programs. The student body at MSU is growing at an astonishingly fast rate (9%/year). With this increase in student body size, the number of MSU research faculty is likewise increasing. The MiSeq will be incorporated into well-established biology classes and ultimately a new NGS elective class will be formulated targeting undergraduates early on in their careers. These classes will effectively train students in laboratory-based research projects where they will learn experimental design, effective use of NGS, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of the DNA data sets in scientific paper format. These classes will have the added benefit of training students wishing to enter into the biotechnology workforce further strengthening the economy. The NGS certification workshops will help advance the careers of participants or give attendees an advantage when applying for jobs in biotechnology or even graduate school. The annual NGS public talks will help to educate the community at large in regards to what is possible in the age of NGS hopefully inspiring the next generation of future scientists. Upcoming scientists in surrounding high schools will also gain inspiration through the Weston Scholars Program (high school student science mentoring).<br/><br/>The MiSeq will support the ever-expanding DNA based research projects being investigated by the faculty, students, and collaborators at all involved institutions. These projects are both multi/inter-disciplinary covering various sub-disciplines within biology, medicine, chemistry, and ecology. In the immediate future, these projects include: 1) Examine the evolutionary loss of functional teeth genes across vertebrate animals; 2) Determine the diet of gelatinous animals such as jellyfish; 3) Identify jellyfish venom genes with potential applications to the treatment of human ailments; 4) Further investigate gene regulation in maize (corn), an agriculturally important crop; 5) Investigate the genetic variation and uniqueness among wildlife pathogens implicated in amphibian declines and mass mortality events worldwide; 6) Characterize the biodiversity of microbes in multiple soil types (e.g. organic soils, contaminated soils); 7) Characterize macroinvertebrate biodiversity in New Jersey streams; 8) Characterize the microorganisms making up harmful algal blooms in order to better manage these blooms and protect drinking and recreational waters; 9) Further explore causative agents of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms by looking at the metal stress response; 10) Further develop parallel computing software to generate phylogenetic trees; 11) Identify molecular changes that could be targeted for treatment when the parasite responsible for lymphatic filarialsis (elephantiasis) undergoes stress."

Using collections of neurons, from 100 or fewer in small invertebrates to hundreds of millions in humans, animals behave in ways that allow survival and reproduction in demanding and often hostile environments. A major hurdle to revealing the principles by which diverse species achieve these goals is being able to monitor the structure and function with high resolution throughout the brain - a necessity because behavior emerges from broad interactions of neurons across brains, even in the simplest organisms. A team of investigators will push optical imaging to this goal through the development of a NeuroNex Neurotechnology Hub at Cornell University. Experts from physics, engineering and biology will work together to develop, demonstrate the utility of, and disseminate to other neuroscientists a suite of imaging tools that will overcome current technology barriers in studying how brains work. Furthermore, the Hub will provide a unique opportunity to educate the next generation of neuroscience researchers to work in interdisciplinary teams that combine the neuroscience, technology development, and big data analysis expertise required to make progress in understanding the brain. Graduate student trainees will also receive instruction in science communication and mentoring in career planning. Opportunities for undergraduate researchers will be provided and the PIs and other project members will become actively engaged in outreach to local-area schools, the broad public, and policymakers.<br/><br/>Large scale, noninvasive recording of neural activity in awake and behaving animals is essential to understand the function of the nervous system. This NeuroNex Neurotechnology Hub will develop and disseminate innovative neurotechnologies for noninvasive recording of neural activity across a large depth and volume, at multiple places in the central and peripheral nervous system, and with high spatial and temporal resolution. The newly developed optical imaging technologies will be employed in behaving animal models across multiple species in different phyla, including mammals, teleost fish, flies, and birds, and will be demonstrated by attacking important neuroscience questions in fruit fly, zebrafish, and mice. We will create a new lab, the Laboratory for Innovative Neurotechnology at Cornell (LINC), which will be shared by the Hub PIs and serve as the physical embodiment of the hub, and close the loop between technology development and biological questions. LINC will serve as a hub for dissemination by hosting, connecting, and training researchers and developers across multiple disciplines from both academia and industry. The dissemination of these new technologies will catalyze studies of how brains produce behavior in species across a broad range of sizes throughout animal phylogeny.

These parameters will be able to tell us about potential selection differences among geographical locations. This new mathematically rigorous framework has the promise to supersede current ad hoc and inadequate summary statistics. Potential applications of this framework include improving interventions for diseases (e.g. individualized responses for HIV patients), and improving our understanding of which gene regions are responsible for long-term survival in harsh environments. The framework will be publicly available in standalone computer software that can be run on small computers or large computing clusters. This research draws from multiple science and technology disciplines (biology, computational science, and statistics) and thus will provide a great basis on which to mentor undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and foster their interest towards a field that desperately needs more training opportunities. <br/><br/>The building blocks for this framework are rooted in coalescence theory, a branch of theoretical population genetics discussing the shapes of genealogies of individuals, and Bayesian statistics evaluating different scenarios and integrating over possible solutions using Markov chain Monte Carlo technology. The data will be genomic sequences which are known to contain technical errors; to successfully differentiate among gene regions that are under selection for particular environments, these errors must be taken into account, but currently are not. Additionally, samples from different geographical locations (for example different patients, different islands, or different habitats) can be grouped in different ways, which requires that the framework be capable of delivering optimality criteria that help to order different scenarios.

In lower-division courses, students study the shapes and functions of selected proteins and nucleic acids. However, deep understanding of structure-function relationships requires visualizing the structure, mapping information from various biological data resources (e.g., polymer sequence, interactions, mutations, variations) onto the structure, and applying biology and/or chemistry knowledge to synthesize explanations of function. Unfortunately, these activities are not common in undergraduate biology curricula. Collaboration between biology, chemistry, and biochemistry educators to adapt molecular visualization approaches currently being used in chemistry can benefit biology education. To that end, the aim of this project is to establish a network of interested faculty that will create case studies, an effective active-learning technique, to teach the relationship between molecular structure and function. The cases will enable students to visualize and analyze challenging real-world problems in atomic detail and apply their biology and/or chemistry knowledge to develop solutions. These molecular visualizations will provide a platform for integrating knowledge from different sub-disciplines of biology, such as biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology to form the foundation for practicing interdisciplinary, team science across STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This RCN-UBE project will establish a new network, Molecular CaseNet, to develop case studies at the interface of biology and chemistry. Objectives of the incubator phase of this project are to 1) bring together an interdisciplinary team of seven scientists and researchers to develop an exemplar for case-study design and determine format requirements for future case studies; 2) create two model case studies focused on specific biological processes/events and discussed at a molecular level; and 3) present the cases in community workshops and professional society meetings to recruit new members to the network and gather feedback on usability, clarity, and relevance of the case studies. Piloting the newly developed case studies with selected student groups will shed light on the relevance of these case studies in learning biology, chemistry, and biochemistry. By using the planned case studies, students with varied levels of expertise and disciplinary training will have the opportunity to understand molecular structure-function relationships and practice the scientific process to address real-world problems. In turn, this practice will help prepare the next generation of workers in STEM fields to creatively apply interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lastly, this project positions the ABRC to be a leader in local, national and international outreach and education, providing opportunities to inspire and train future generations of plant scientists.  <br/><br/>There are three specific goals of this project.  The first is to continue to provide cutting-edge resources to the global Arabidopsis community at an accessible cost.  This will be accomplished by increasing revenue through new services offered and by decreasing expenses through improved efficiency.  The ABRC also aims to increase the number of users through a second goal, which is to expand the utility of the ABRC collection by diversifying beyond Arabidopsis.  As data on other plants, including crops, are genome-enabled, they will require resource repositories.  To that end, the infrastructure of the ABRC will be leveraged to support plant biology more broadly than in the past.  The third goal is to lead local and global efforts to educate the public about plant biology.  The ABRC will also engage a broader plant science community in outreach efforts, increase awareness of plants among the general public by creating interactive activities and provide a more user-friendly online source of information for non-specialists.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Global change has produced key challenges to ecosystems today. These are challenges that the fossil record, which preserves biological responses to major disturbances over thousands to millions of years, is well-equipped to explain. This project focuses on two disturbances that impacted ecosystems approximately 10,000 years ago: the end of the last Ice Age, and the extinction of very large mammals (megafauna). These two events gave rise to abnormal present-day communities in which the largest predators tend to be medium- to small-sized mesocarnivores, like coyotes and bobcats. In the face of continuing global change and the removal of large carnivores like grey wolves, mesocarnivores before and after the dual disturbances present a natural laboratory for tracking how mammal communities respond to large-scale ecological and environmental perturbation. Set at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California, this project embodies a double meaning for ""community paleoecology"": involving the diverse human communities of modern LA in studying the diverse carnivore communities of prehistoric LA. Using the paleontology of charismatic mesocarnivores as a ""gateway science"" by which to introduce the scientific method, the Fellow will: (1) train student interns from community colleges and UC Merced to identify and describe fossil species; and (2) crowdsource collection of paleoecological data by museum visitors, adding to a dynamic museum experience.<br/><br/>To investigate living mesocarnivores in the aftermath of climatic change and megafaunal extinction, the Fellow is integrating radiocarbon dating, systematic taxonomy, geometric morphometrics, and stable isotope analysis of mesocarnivores and their prey from California ecosystems preserved over the past 50,000 years. The Fellow aims to: (1) build a robust temporal framework, ranging from pre-Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene post-extinction, on which to scaffold ecological inferences; (2) quantify changes in mesocarnivore community structure and ecomorphology; and (3) weigh the relative importance of climate versus extinctions in shifting mesocarnivore feeding ecology. By integrating paleontology and community ecology, this research will obtain deep historical insight into modern ecosystem function. Additionally, this project enables the Fellow to: (1) refine skills in mentoring and managing a research team; (2) develop collections-management and curation experience through identifying and cataloging specimens; and (3) strengthen outreach by innovating strategies for collections-based citizen science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The improvements implemented in this project take full advantage of this opportunity, facilitating cutting-edge behavioral and ecological 'omics experiments at the University of California's Gump South Pacific Research Station. The new Coral Reef Ecological Omics Lab (CREOL) implements plans drawn up with previous NSF support to develop a Coral Reef Genomic Observatory at the Gump Station. The CREOL facility will expand and improve the research station's existing marine lab and mesocosm facilities, providing necessary equipment for sample processing and temporary storage of specimens, prior to analyses at laboratories in California and beyond. This research enhances society's ability to understand and sustain coral reef ecosystems and the services they provide. Coral reefs are hotspots for biological diversity and are sources of great societal significance and economic value. Local and global processes, often associated with human activities, increasingly threaten the continued health of these exceptional natural systems. New research on population dynamics, ecosystem processes, biodiversity and resilience is critical to successful management, conservation, and restoration of coral reefs. <br/><br/>The new Coral Reef Ecological Omics Lab expands and extends the types of scientific study carried out at the University of California's Gump South Pacific Research Station (www.moorea.berkeley.edu), increasing the research station's capacity to support genomics and other 'omics-based research. While the new facility primarily serves researchers and students studying marine ecosystems, notably those associated with NSF's Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, it also supports studies in terrestrial and freshwater environments. The new facility has two key components: first increased wet lab capacity to support a suite of new mesocosms, and second, an upgraded molecular laboratory to handle the concomitant increase in biosamples and the need to efficiently process and ship those samples to home institutions for a variety of 'omics analyses. These improvements enable the application of genomics and related new technologies in process-oriented research and long-term studies. The project develops an approach that stabilizes biosamples at the field station, maximizing the quality of contextual information and metadata management. Biosamples are transported to core facilities based at home institutions for the actual omics analyses, while maintaining provenance information and the integrity of the data value chain through advanced biological informatics software, such as the Genomic Observatories Metadatabase (GEOME).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field station will serve a variety of research, teaching, and outreach missions of the university.  The ORFS has already provided an excellent venue for experiential learning.  Students have conducted research projects as part of 7 classes taught at the field station, and for independent research credit.  Missouri S&T has recently implemented an experiential learning requirement for all undergraduates, and data from field station classes can be used in assessing learning outcomes of the requirement.  The Mill Creek watershed also provides a great setting for novel research.  Sites along the stream have varying hydroperiods that can serve as a natural experiment for examining the effects of droughts from climate change on such streams.  Several animal taxa in the watershed are endangered or of concern, while other taxa are of recreational interest, such as trout, turkey, and deer.  Conservation and restoration programs for these and other taxa can be evaluated for their effectiveness as a guide for wider implementation.  The ORFS will serve to introduce students, local residents, and a diverse constituency to the value of Ozark ecosystems and field research.  Outreach opportunities with local K-12 schools, community groups, and others are envisioned.  Several outreach events have already taken place at the field station and the surrounding area.  A large BioBlitz occurred in the watershed recently, involving over 80 scientists and citizens in a large-scale inventory of biota along with a trash cleanup and festival.<br/><br/>The planning effort will include three goals:  1) Establish an advisory board of on-campus faculty and staff, local stakeholders and collaborators from government agencies, and representatives from other field stations in Missouri and around the country.  This advisory board will hold meetings at the ORFS, and the ORFS leaders will visit other field stations.  2) Expand the capabilities and opportunities at the field station in the next few years.  This goal will focus on the growth of the research, teaching, and outreach programs for users from Missouri S&T, other campuses, government agencies, and local communities.  In addition to university personnel, several key groups, such as Missouri Stream Teams and Master Naturalists, will benefit from activities and access to the station.  Also, the Newburg Children?s Museum and the Kaleidoscope Discovery Center, two local science museums, can use the field station for educational activities.  3) Adopt a 5-year strategic plan based on feedback from the advisory board.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research aims to investigate how animals use chemical signals to select mates for reproduction. It is known that animals use a variety of olfactory signals to navigate the natural world, however, how these signals are translated by the olfactory system to generate behavioral responses (e.g. mate selection) are not well understood. With Heliconius butterflies as the model system, this project seeks to identify specific smell receptor genes in butterfly antennae that are involved in the recognition of potential mates. Utilizing genetic and behavioral methods, this research will attempt to link olfactory genes and signals to mate selection behavior. During this appointment, the fellow will: (a) be trained in emerging and novel genetic techniques, (b) establish a K-12 science outreach program for local schools, and (c) help develop a new Functional Genomics course for undergraduates. <br/><br/>Insects are dependent on olfactory cues to complete fundamental biological processes such as foraging, oviposition, and mate choice. While extensive experimental evidence supports the importance of chemical cues in these processes, the mechanisms linking detection of odor cues to complex behavioral responses remain largely unknown. This research will bridge this gap by integrating analyses of chemosensory receptor genes and patterns of mate choice in Heliconius butterflies. The project will link genes and behavior by describing the genetic architecture of chemosensation in two behaviorally distinct, incipient species pairs and relating olfactory receptors to pre-mating isolation and mate choice. The specific objectives of the project are to: (1) identify the genetic architecture of chemosensation in Heliconius using gene expression data, (2) develop and validate knock-out mutants for candidate olfactory receptor genes using gene editing methods and olfactory bioassays, and (3) use knock-out mutants to test the role of candidate genes in mate choice with behavioral trials. As part of this appointment, the fellow will: (a) receive training in new gene editing (CRISPR/cas9) and electroantennography techniques, (b) establish an outreach program where undergraduates will teach hands-on science lessons in local K-12 classrooms, and (c) help develop a new undergraduate Functional Genomics course that will serve as an introduction to novel genomic methods and provide hands-on experience with classic techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The collection includes specimens collected during the first around the world voyage of Captain James Cook, as well as specimens collected by famed American scientist George Washington Carver. This project will assist with repatriation of 25,000 recently returned specimens and provide long-term collection security.  The project will provide curatorial support for reorganization and damage assessment of the collection, as well as internship opportunities for students interested in herbarium/curatorial/museum sciences.  In addition, societal benefits include workshops, exhibits, and improved digital data access for scientists, educators, students, and members of the general public to this important resource.<br/><br/>This project seeks to perform critical improvements for the Arthur Fungarium (PUR), which after an 18 year lapse in curatorial activity, is now being revitalized through reinvestments by the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology at Purdue University. The Arthur Fungarium is unique as a global resource, and this project will help to return it to its former status as the premier institution in the world for the study of rust fungi (Pucciniales) and their host plants. Not only are the data and specimens at PUR of importance for the study of rust fungi, but they are doubly valuable in that they also preserve material and data for all host specimens (across the breadth of vascular plants), further broadening the use and impact of this collection. This project will address an urgent need for reorganization of the collections within the Arthur, both in keeping with new taxonomic principles, but especially to safeguard and accommodate ca. 25,000 recently repatriated specimens.  Specific goals include performing a curatorial upgrade, including repairs and reorganization of the collections; safeguarding, databasing, and reintegrating the repatriated material; complete barcoding and databasing of the entire holdings of PUR (including capture of host data); and increasing public and scientific awareness of the Arthur Fungarium collection. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public."

Indeed, almost every facet of our lives - from the food we eat to the medicine we take, the houses we live in to the natural scenery we admire - has a connection to the biodiversity present on Earth. All species must be named and cataloged in order for humans to understand the world around us. The scientific field of taxonomy, responsible for identifying and describing species, has incurred a reduction in its specialist workforce in recent decades; this is unfortunate because the need for taxonomy has never been greater as human activities result in unprecedented decline in the diversity of life. This project will help to reduce the burden placed on current and future taxonomists to identify and catalog biodiversity by introducing a set of open-source, web-based tools for identifying species from images and for measuring imaged specimens for comparative studies. These software tools will be made freely available through the publicly-funded CyVerse web platform. In addition, a system for identifying dragonflies and damselflies called ODOMATIC will be implemented on an existing web presence, OdonataCentral, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to accurately identify these insects from images of their wings. A series of free workshops will be offered in diverse urban communities in New Jersey and Alabama to increase the diversity of OdonataCentral?s user base, encourage participation in the STEM fields, and generally increase appreciation and understanding of the natural world. A series of Google Hangout events will encourage international user-ship for ODOMATIC from World Dragonfly Association members in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition, undergraduate students from Rutgers University-Newark will be recruited to help in designing and training ODOMATIC, giving them valuable experience in research, programming and taxonomy.<br/> <br/>This work will help to reduce the taxonomic impediment - an urgent need for more taxonomic products, like species descriptions and specimen identifications, from fewer taxonomist workers - by addressing the time-consuming, but necessary, task that is species identification. Objectives of this project include release of a newly-developed system for automatically identifying Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) from images of their wings, which uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize and classify species.  An interface will be deployed making species identification using this system accessible through the OdonataCentral website (odonatacentral.org).  In addition, stand-alone tools will be developed for automatically describing and placing geometric morphometric landmarks on specimens in biological imagery for use in morphology-based comparative studies.  The successful completion of these objectives will benefit the odonatological community by providing dragonfly and damselfly identification.  More broadly, the tools created here will allow biologists studying other groups of organisms to rapidly extract morphological data from images of their specimens."

The collection has doubled in size in 15 years as a result of an active field program, and rescue and curation of valuable relinquished collections. The FLMNH-IZ is a major research node for studies on mollusks and tropical marine invertebrates. It serves the third largest collection of specimen-data on non-insect invertebrates in the world and is used broadly by the research community. The collection averages 35-40 visitors, 75-80 loans, and is the basis of 40-50 publications a year. The project will also allow the curation of three high-quality relinquished collections. The Harry Lee collection is perhaps the most important private shell collection in the US and includes specimens of 12,000 identified species.  The Maturo and McKinney Bryozoa collections are among the largest in the country of the poorly known but highly diverse ""moss animals"".  The NOAA-NCRMP collection is an alcohol-fixed, wet collection of reef invertebrates holding several thousand species taken from 26 islands across the tropical Pacific over the past decade, including from several remote, uninhabited, and virtually unknown islands.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The Fellow studies marine invertebrates of the class Anthozoa, including reef-building corals and sea anemones, which are in imminent danger of extinction due to climate change. Anthozoans harbor photosynthetic algae within their body tissues and rely on the exchange of nutrients with these 'symbionts' for survival. As the acidity of seawater continues to increase (a phenomenon called ocean acidification) the fate of this essential relationship becomes increasingly uncertain. A better understanding of this biological association (or symbiosis) at the cellular level will help scientists create more sophisticated, and species-specific, conservation strategies. This proposal will develop cutting-edge cell biology techniques to study Anthozoan symbiosis and understand its susceptibility to ocean acidification. The research will use the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida; an organism that has demonstrated excellent potential for both cell biology research as well as science education. The Fellow will use Aiptasia to directly engage high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in climate change research.<br/><br/>Anthozoans communicate with their symbiotic algae through pH-dependent mechanisms. The master regulator of pH homeostasis in corals is the enzyme soluble Adenylyl Cyclase (sAC). However, the role of sAC-dependent signaling in symbiosis remains poorly defined. A recent technical breakthrough demonstrates that DNA and protein expression can be manipulated in Aiptasia pallida embryos. The Fellow will exploit this technical advance to investigate how sAC dynamically regulates pH homeostasis and symbiosis in Aiptasia. Specifically, this research will: 1. Perform the first in vitro characterization of Anthozoan sAC. 2. Use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology to silence sAC gene expression and measure whether it is both necessary and sufficient for pH homeostasis and symbiosis. 3. Use FRET biosensor technology to measure the temporal and spatial dynamics of sAC signaling in live Aiptasia cells. This fellowship will provide new training for the Fellow in the fields of marine biology, symbiosis and microscopy. Data will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. Broadening participation activities will include: research activities with freshman from a minority-serving public high school, summer research internships for high school minority women, and active recruitment of minority undergraduates to laboratory research positions. Educational materials will be shared through an open-access website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes have been shown to be responsible for morphological, physiological, and behavioral differences, and to contribute to the diversity observed in nature. Advances in sequencing technology are making new genome data available at faster rates than ever before. As the number of species with sequenced genomes grows, so will the number of researchers wanting to take advantage of these valuable resources. They will come from a wide range of biological fields, and have an equally wide range of experience with computational tools. CAFE (Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution) is a software package that allows researchers to better understand rates of gene gain and loss.  This project will result in a version of CAFE that adds to the national infrastructure by enabling new biological discoveries to the benefit of scientists working in many fields. CAFE will be a useful tool in science education, and will also improve and accelerate biological research that can be expected to have multiple societal benefits, including understanding the genetic basis for important biological phenotypes. A vigorous outreach and information dissemination plan will ensure that researchers and faculty engaged in research education are aware of CAFE and able to use it effectively, and will promote the development of a technology-savvy 21st century biology research community.<br/><br/>Studies of gene families are essential to a number of research areas, including gene regulation, human disease, and evolutionary genomics. CAFE enables these and other studies into cutting-edge areas by providing a likelihood method for analyzing gene gain and loss over a phylogeny. This method has been shown to work well with the error-prone genome assemblies currently available for most organisms, as well as when analyzing dozens of genomes at a time. This project will extend these capabilities to hundreds or thousands of genomes. To accomplish this goal, several of the maximum likelihood methodologies implemented by CAFE will be re-designed. These changes will include allowing rate variation among gene families, optimizing likelihood calculations on trees, and improving specification of several probability distributions used by these calculations.

Proteins are large molecules with thousands of atoms and perform most cellular functions. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, and these chains fold into specific structures. In general, proteins must alter their shape in order to perform their biological function. For example, Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen, changes shape in order for oxygen to bind. The internal vibrations of the protein structure that enable this change in shape are critical for understanding protein function. Recently a method has been devised to measure protein internal vibrations, called crystal anisotropic terahertz microscopy (CATM). The instrumentation and protocol development in this project makes CATM accessible to non-specialists, and enables broad application of the technique. The development of this instrument leads to the interdisciplinary education of two graduate students and two undergraduates. Integrated with the instrument development are educational and outreach activities that include an undergraduate seminar course and a week-long summer program for 7-12th grade inner city students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to produce a compact turn-key spectroscopic system for the routine characterization of intramolecular vibrations of proteins. The technique called crystal anisotropic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (CATM) uniquely measures these motions. Auto-CATM  provides non-experts with the ability to quickly and easily categorize and classify biomacromolecules. The mini-system from Zomega Terahertz Corp. is the starting platform for the final instrument. A proof-of-concept database, and molecular modeling and data visualization software toolbox facilitate the development this new instrument. This instrument provides insights into how intramolecular vibrations are impacted by frequently modified parameters such as binding state and temperature. The technology developed for Auto-CATM also enable new rapid measurements for both bulk and micron scale materials and thus impact solid state physics and materials science."

Genetic association studies measure sequence differences across an entire genome in order to identify what variants cause the occurrence and variability of traits like height and disease susceptibility. The goal of this project is to develop methods to precisely locate gene regulatory variants, that now are only known to be somewhere in a large region, and use them to understand how traits vary in a population. The methods developed in this research aim to combine a number of types of information, like gene expression levels for cells, measurement of traits in many individuals, and comparisons with traits in other species, in order to identify causal regulatory variants. The project's curriculum development activities will contribute to STEM education by creating and sharing a hands-on workshop on genome bioinformatics in the research area. By integrating research and educational activities students will (i) gain science literacy in the areas of genetics and bioinformatics;  (ii) show how well hands-on methods work in genetics education; and (iii) use already performed genetic association studies to gain new knowledge in biology and in biomedicine.<br/><br/>This research will create and evaluate an integrative machine-learning model for identifying regulatory variants within human intergenic GWAS regions. The model's inputs will include the reference genome, the local DNA 3-D shape, phylogenetic conservation, and transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements. The model's output will be predicted regulatory variants with significance scores. The model will be benchmarked against published methods using ground-truth regulatory variants. The machine-learning model's variant predictions will be incorporated into an open-source, web-based software tool for integrative post-analysis of GWAS data. Compatibility with a cloud-computing framework will position the tool for maximum impact. Through educational activities that are integrated with the project's research activities, Dr. Ramsey will create, evaluate, and disseminate a Genome Bioinformatics Workshop unit for high school educators and students. Participants will learn to use the tool to analyze and explore human GWAS-identified regions for a model trait (height); through this they would be expected to gain a better understanding of the potential of the field of personal genomics. The workshop's materials will be developed within an interdisciplinary workshop incubator consisting of pairs of STEM-underrepresented CS and biology undergraduate summer students.

The ability to conduct science directly in the ocean environment will be a unique national capability that will transform our understanding of the ocean and can potentially enable prediction of adverse impacts on industries such as fishing and coastal tourism. The project will advance the study of marine biology by extending previous laboratory research into more realistic experiments in the field. Importantly, the technology developed during this project will be made available free-of-charge to other U.S. researchers through a loan program developed and tested under prior NSF support. A small business will collaborate with the researchers toward low-cost manufacturing of the technology. The project will support a diverse workforce through the hiring and training of a full-time graduate student and summer students recruited through a program of targeted research opportunities for underrepresented students. These researchers will conduct laboratory and field work at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, exposing them to front-line field research.<br/>Knowledge of aquatic animal ecology depends upon accurate measurement of individual organisms for critical processes such as feeding, behavior, and associated fluid motions. Imaging of these interactions has yielded important advances in the understanding of these processes, but has depended primarily upon the controlled conditions of the laboratory. Laboratory conditions allow advanced optical configurations to provide high spatial and temporal resolution moving images within highly controlled conditions. However, these same controlled and defined conditions may also inadvertently create artificial environments that affect the outcome of natural process measurements. The goal of this research is to enable in situ measurements that combine novel daytime particle image velocimetry (PIV); high-resolution, collimated brightfield imaging, and three-dimensional image holography. This new technology will enable (1) direct quantification of complex processes, such as feeding and swimming in turbulent flows under variable lighting conditions, (2) detailed field measurements of animals that are important in the environment but comparatively intractable for controlled laboratory studies, and (3) field confirmation of laboratory data on processes such as predator-prey interactions."

Knowing the nature and level of cyst nematode infestation in a field will help the farmer monitor the effectiveness of and plan for better pest management strategies, thereby improving soybean productivity. The instrument technology will be disseminated through extension talks to Iowa farmers and agribusiness personnel, online newsletters, videos on educational websites, and demonstrations at scientific and farmer conferences. Outreach will be conducted to stakeholders in the seed industry and universities to convince them to test the new instrument and provide feedback.

The only definite way to accurately identify SCN infestations and predict future crop damage in fields is by extracting and counting the number of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs in the soil. Current nematode extraction procedures and instruments are very old and labor intensive, and it is challenging to automate methods of soil processing and analysis. This project is to build a modern, automated instrument to perform all the mechanical functions involved in current nematode extraction procedures. Also, a smartphone-based microscope with custom software will be realized for the counting of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs.

This collection is currently at risk due to lack of curation, poor storage conditions, and imminent removal to offsite storage.  The project will unite two scientifically significant Midwest US collections and facilitate achievement of two major goals: (1) secure the collection in a dedicated storage facility with appropriate climate controlled conditions, and (2) curate and disseminate the collection to the scientific and broader community for research and education.  Paleontology collections excite the imagination of public audiences and inspire the next generation of scientists.  Cincinnati has a long history of paleontological research and education beginning in the mid-1800s.  This tradition will continue under this project by training undergraduate and graduate students in curatorial skills through student internships.

Furthermore, the instrument will enable the development of new teaching modules for other undergraduate biology classes where the need to procure data for many students in a short time frame precludes the use of existing instruments. This instrument will also have a large impact on underrepresented students involved in the Science Career Explorations programs, YMCA campus Y program for inner-city school children, and ENDURE program for underrepresented students entering neuroscience graduate school.<br/><br/>The field of live cell imaging has recently enabled researchers to resolve physiological and molecular events in cells deep within tissues with micron- and millisecond-resolution. The new multiphoton system will provide deep, fast and super-resolution imaging technology for the first time to users in the departments of Biology, Physics, and Engineering at Washington University and from area institutions. Initial research uses for the new system will include work on cortical microtubules in plant cells; analysis of biosensors in root cells and pollen dynamics.  Other researchers working with animal systems will study neuronal cell populations, tendon fascicles, and a range of other topics. Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both training and outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without preserving historic baseline data and continuing to monitor these sites, the long term effects of climate change and disturbed environment cannot be understood. Faculty, graduate students, STEM teachers, governmental agencies and Idyllwild community leaders, collaborate to provide classroom instruction and communication with nonscientists and the public. The goal is to share with the general public an increased understanding of ecological science, including its findings, applications and pursuit of new discoveries. The proposed strategic plan will guide integration of research, teaching and outreach while preserving the unique natural resources and scientific legacy of the James and Oasis de los Osos. <br/>  <br/>This planning activity will develop a 5 year plan for the James San Jacinto Mountains and Oasis de los Osos Reserves, two of 39 Reserves in the University of California Natural Reserve system. The strategic plan will devise steps to increase research, training and educational outreach activities while minimizing the impact of those activities on the Reserves. The overarching goal is to maximize understanding and stewardship of the unique desert-to-mountain ecotone through scientific research and education of teachers, students and the general public. Recent improvements in reserve facilities and changes in personnel and use patterns at the James and Oasis de los Osos Reserves require new vision and strategic plan on order to address the needs of current and future stakeholders. These circumstances have created a need to seek external expertise to help identify additional infrastructural improvements necessary to support the increased overnight capacity; suggest programmatic directions that will take advantage of the new facilities and will complement and enhance existing academic programs and databases; and define appropriate development of Oasis de los Osos to allow increased use without compromising the environment."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The Fellow will characterize the navigation and diving abilities of northern elephant seal pups. Three months after birth these young animals begin their first migration, learning to navigate and forage without any parental instruction. Despite exhibiting the farthest independent migration of any mammal, it is unknown how these seals find their way, or their way home, in a seemingly featureless ocean. In the next 100 years, increases in sea surface temperature and decreases in primary productivity are expected in the North Pacific Ocean. These changes are expected to affect northern elephant seals by shifting their critical foraging habitat northward by 1,000km and deeper in the water column. Thus, it is important to determine whether elephant seal navigation and diving are genetically passed on from mother to daughter and if so, how that might limit their adaptive capacities to predicted climate change. <br/><br/>The Fellow will work with sponsoring scientist Dr. Daniel Costa from the University of California Santa Cruz to analyze existing and newly-collected tracking and diving data from mother elephant seals and their female pups. Using a novel simulation model, the Fellow will predict the impacts of climate change on a predator with top-down ecosystem control. In these ways, the Fellow will be trained in cutting-edge biologging and computational techniques and will obtain professional development opportunities in science communication. Animal navigation is an intriguing field that provides an ideal basis for teaching students key concepts in behavior, ecology, and evolution. By incorporating results into high school biology learning modules, the Fellow will gain valuable teaching skills. Research findings will also be communicated with docents and visitors at the A?o Nuevo State Park research site in collaboration with the State Park PORTS distance learning program. Finally, the Fellow will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work of the TABER (Technology for Animal Biology and Environmental Research) group at Cornell is like a real-life project team for engineering students. In the course of this project, the principal investigator and professional engineers will interact with at least a dozen engineering students, and they will interact with biologists and professional engineers in designing and producing devices that will be applied immediately to answer real-world questions about wildlife biology and conservation. This will give students a distinctive chance to have their design efforts make a difference outside Cornell. Because of the structure of the dissemination plan, the roll out of each new design is part of the research of collaborating scientists around the world, and this use has broader impacts in both basic and applied biology and ecology and ""word of mouth"" circulation among potential users and collaborators world-wide.  A graduate student will be funded to make environmental sensors available to a very wide audience by producing multi-purpose boards to be distributed on Seeed Studio, along with instructional materials on sensor design and construction techniques. News of the project's progress will be passed whenever possible through a network of highly effective communication colleagues in the Colleges of Engineering and Agriculture and Life Sciences and the Education and Multimedia groups at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.<br/><br/>Through the development of a General-purpose Programmable Tag (GPT) and a Digital Turnstile Tag (DTT), this project will extend the limits of how small extremely long-lived tags can be.  The GPT functions much like traditional beeper tags, with limited abilities to telemeter data, but small size (ca. 0.4 g) and a lifespan longer than that of most birds. Proposed improvements in tag design and antenna placement should dramatically decrease problems for birds wearing the tags, and the proposed information infrastructure that will follow the tags from programming to deployment should make the tag id data highly functional and reliable for all users. This tag has the potential to revolutionize the real-time monitoring of bird migration and the study of dispersal. The proposed DTT would decline to as little as 1 g in mass, and, though it will be optimized to collect solar geolocation data at first, the same platform could be used for an extremely broad array of sensing applications in an open-ended Lab-on-a-Bird platform. In its geolocation function, the DTT would leverage all the progress that has been made recently with geolocation loggers and extend dramatically the range of species to which the technology can be applied by removing the requirement for repeat capture for data recovery in a very small package."

The result of research in the middle and latter half of the Twentieth Century, these collections are irreplaceable, and illustrate anatomical features of wild, horticultural and crop plants as well as extinct fossil plants, from algae to pine trees to orchids.  In addition to documenting the original work of eminent plant scientists, the collection is a source of further investigation, rechecking of published information, and new studies.  Each slide required an extensive and labor-intensive process, from procurement of plant material (often from remote tropical regions), detailed preparation, embedding and sectioning, staining for optical clarity, and permanently mounting on glass slides.  Because of their great scientific value and connection to the history of plant anatomy and paleobotany, the collections are priceless and unique.  By stabilizing and preserving the slides, this project will save a valuable and irreplaceable resource for the scientific community.  The project will also image and database the slides and make these data available through the web to the general public and scientific community.  This public resource will allow college and high school teachers of biology, plant sciences, and forestry to access high-quality anatomical slides for demonstration without needing to purchase or prepare materials themselves.  All images and data will also be made available to an even broader community through sharing of data with national and international portals.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to inventory, stabilize and protect the CUPAC and CUPC-S collections and associated notebooks, and to image and digitize ca. 75,000 slides.

Many of the CUPAC slides are vouchered with herbarium specimens and all of the CUPC-S materials are vouchered with fossil specimens housed at Cornell. The collections include an exceptional representation of herbarium-vouchered palm (Arecaceae) material from Bailey, Moore and Uhl, important publication vouchers for Bierhorst and Eames, contributed slides from Carlquist, Esau and Maheshwari, and pivotal early plant fossil preparations by Banks.  The project will include barcoding, linkage to data from associated notebooks, linkage to Cornell herbarium and fossil databases, and digital imaging with high-resolution light microscopy using a 32-megapixel system.  All slides will be rehoused in new cabinets and damaged mounts will be repaired where possible.  The online database will allow advanced search by organ/tissue/feature, taxonomic identity, scientist/researcher, locality and publication.  In addition, online measurement tools will provide a means of utilizing the system for remote analysis by scientists, and direct use in plant anatomy and paleontology instruction at all levels, including college and K-12.

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The Fellow's research will focus on better understanding how the loss of an important and complex trait 'limbs' occurs in a group of Australian lizards that are adapted to sandy environments. This work will provide the most thorough study of limb morphology patterns across this large group of species using dozens of existing museum specimens. The research will also leverage developmental data and genetic information to begin to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause changes in limb shape. The Fellow will gather most of these data during an extended visit to the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, Australia and Museum fur Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. The Fellow will also gain experience mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. Public and educational outreach will also be pursued through the production of teaching lessons for high school and college students that convey fundamental biological concepts in genetics, development, and evolution.<br/><br/>The evolution of limb loss is an important adaptive transition among animals. How such complex traits evolve, and how and why they are evolutionarily plastic in some lineages, remain fundamental questions in biology. Limb reduction or loss has also occurred numerous times in tetrapods, most frequently among lineages of squamate reptiles. This raises the question of whether adaptive traits are constrained and canalized in vertebrates, leading to convergent phenotypic and molecular patterns across limbless taxa. This project will address these important evolutionary questions by studying limb reduction and loss within a genus of Australian lizards (Lerista) by testing hypotheses about the genetic underpinnings of limb morphology and patterns of morphological, genetic, and developmental evolutionary convergence. The Fellow will use an integrative approach combining morphological, developmental, and genomic data to (1) discern the number of independent morphotype series present in Lerista, (2) characterize the anatomical and molecular signatures associated with pentadactyl limb development within this genus, (3) identify the putative molecular bases of limb reduction within this clade, and (4) resolve the degree of morphological and molecular convergence mediating parallel limb evolution. The Fellow will be trained in gathering morphological and developmental data, will significantly extend his genomics knowledge and skillset, and will be provided opportunities to mentor and educate younger scientists and students in the life sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last decade has seen a revolution in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). With increasing frequency, single particle analysis (SPA) is providing cryo-EM maps at resolutions on par with X-ray crystallography, resulting in atomic models for a growing number of macromolecular assemblies - ribosomes, transcription complexes, proteasomes, viruses, integral membrane proteins and CRISPR/Cas targeting complexes - all directly from cryo-EM data. Cryoelectron tomography (CET) can now provide 3D images of cellular structures at 2-5 nm resolution, and in favorable cases to sub-nanometer resolution. The new multi-user 200 kV cryo-electron microscope  will serve the regional cellular and molecular life sciences community in Montana and the surrounding states. The new system will immediately benefit investigators in at least 5 different departments on two different campuses within the Montana University System (UM and MSU), as well as investigators at regional institutions in a five-state area. In addition, the system will have a significant impact on undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral education, allowing emerging scientists in the Northern Rockies to develop expertise with modern cryo-EM techniques. Finally, it will greatly enhance K-12 teacher education and outreach programs by MSUs Thermal Biology Institute, the Center for Biofilm Engineering, the Chemistry and Biochemistry REU program, and outreach to Montana's Tribal Colleges through MSU's MAP and Bridges to Baccalaureate Programs.<br/> <br/>Recent technical advances in cryo-EM allow the structures of macromolecular complexes to be modeled at the atomic level by SPA, and observation of these structures within the native cellular environment with CET. Combined, SPA and CET provide profound biological insight into the biochemical activities and mechanisms of cellular machinery. Toward this end, investigators across the Northern Rockies have initiated cryo-EM studies of CRISPR/Cas targeting complexes, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, archaeal viruses in the ""3rd domain"" of life, new world hemorrhagic viruses, and iron transport in mammals and pathogenic bacteria. The new 200 kV cryo-EM in the Northern Rockies region will enable groundbreaking investigations of macromolecular and cellular structures at ultrahigh resolution.  Data and analyses from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and used in both educational and public outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At present, college STEM educators rarely have formal training in teaching. As such, many teach the way they were taught using a passive, lecture method that leads to low retention and success rates for students who enter college declaring STEM majors, especially those from under-represented groups. The resulting STEM workforce is therefore unable to meet the current demand for those professionals and does not represent the diversity of the society it serves. Over the past decade many initiatives have emerged to address this issue and have made some progress in spreading awareness and some solutions. While STEM education is changing, the pace is slower than the shifting societal demands. This new network will allow established initiatives to share effective strategies and to join forces testing new strategies to increase the rate of progress in STEM education reform and increase the success and retention of all students in STEM majors.<br/> <br/>To meet the needs of the future workforce, we need to retain a larger and more diverse population of STEM undergraduates. A barrier to increasing retention, specifically increasing participation by under-represented groups, is the continued predominance of a transmission model of post-secondary STEM education which has become a marked issue of social justice. To speed adoption of evidence-based practices in post-secondary life sciences education, the goal of this proposal is to build connections between prominent education transformation efforts, starting in the life sciences, to foster interactions that increase the efficacy of each initiative. Using a three-phased Networked Improvement Communities format, a combination of four in-person and multiple virtual meetings will be used to improve knowledge and awareness, foster communication and facilitate coordinated action to identify and implement common solutions to move the needle on common challenges. Ten prominent life sciences initiatives serving thousands of educators and impacting hundreds of thousands of students will build relationships, analyze common challenges, identify steps for change, and subsequently test changes to collect and share data. The last phase will focus on building capacity to scale efforts based upon a deeper understanding of organizational change strategies. This project will contribute to increasing and diversifying the STEM workforce by growing a network to enhance the impact of the initiatives involved whose common mission is to increase adoption of evidence-based teaching in post-secondary STEM education, and improving the impact of a broader community of reform efforts by increasing our knowledge of effective organizational change strategies.  <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All of these new features are expected to increase statistical power to detect true associations.  The broader impacts of this project will include: enhanced computational infrastructure for conducting mixed model association mapping via the continued release of open-source software; multi-disciplinary synergy from research, collaborations and conferences that will bring together plant, livestock, model organism and human geneticists; and increased participation of underrepresented groups via the HSPH Summer Program in Quantitative Sciences.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This study of goldback ferns (Pentagramma; Pteridaceae) investigates the evolutionary and ecological implications of polyploidy (whole genome duplication) and hybridization (genome merging) in nature. Hybridization and polyploidy exert long-term effects on the evolution of lineages across the tree of life. However, only recently have we had the tools to address the impacts of these processes on evolution. This research addresses long-standing questions about evolution, such as the relative contribution of genome duplication versus genome merging in the ecological and evolutionary success of polyploids, and how genome and cell size vary across the landscape. This work will enhance the usefulness of museum specimens through novel, cost-effective, and high-throughput approaches that can be applied to other systems.<br/> <br/>Conceptualizing polyploid formation as taking place at various positions along a polyploid spectrum?measured by polyploid subgenome divergence?provides a framework in which to test the ecological and genetic determinants of polyploid success. In order to delineate diploid and polyploid species and address geographic, ecological, and phenotypic effects of subgenome divergence in Pentagramma, the fellow will: 1) assess ploidy levels and genome size specimens using a combination of chromosome counts and flow cytometry; 2) infer phylogenetic relationships among diploids and polyploids using chloroplast and nuclear markers; 3) measure genetic distance between polyploid subgenomes; 4) compare geographic range and niche breadth between and among diploids and polyploids; 5) measure spore size, exudate quantity, and chemotype; and 6) assess correlations between subgenome divergence and spatial variables, and among phenotypic traits and spatial variables. These data will allow for a test of the hypothesis that polyploids are most successful when formed between progenitors with intermediate levels of divergence. The use of museum specimens as a source of material for ecologically relevant data is highly important for studies of fern evolution and ecology. This approach will retrieve genomic data from old and degraded samples and can serve as a proof of concept for other studies relying on biological collections of similar samples. In order to promote the sharing of tools and research results, the fellow will lead workshops and seminars at the University of California, Berkeley Botanical Garden, California Academy of Sciences, and regional universities.

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Spencer Galen is ""Testing the Oscillation Hypothesis of Symbiont Diversification using Parasites Isolated from Host Tissue Collections"" The host institution for the fellowship are the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (ANSDU) and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jason Weckstein.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to identify the factors that influence the diversification and distribution of symbiotic organisms (organisms that live in close association with a host), a group that is thought to comprise the majority of species on Earth. Symbionts play critically important roles in the function of ecological communities worldwide, though the traits and general rules that have produced modern symbiont diversity are still poorly understood. This project will gain insight into the patterns and processes that have resulted in the incredible diversity of modern symbionts by studying an expansive collection of avian malaria parasites, a symbiont group that is closely related to the deadly human malaria parasites. Specifically, this research will examine how variation in the number of host species that a parasite can infect, known as ""host breadth"", influences a parasite's potential to diversify or colonize new geographic regions. By analyzing the host breadth of malaria parasites that have been isolated from a large collection of avian tissues sampled across North and South America, this research will improve our understanding of how parasites and symbionts more broadly have come to be so exceptionally diverse and have attained their current distributions. In addition, studying the causes of parasite diversification and distributions will lead to a better understanding of when and where novel disease-causing parasite species originate, a problem of major importance in today's rapidly changing world. Training objectives include sequence capture probe design and implementation, phylogenomic analysis, phylogenetic comparative analysis, and methods used in parasite specimen acquisition, accession, and curation. Broader impacts include outreach importance of symbionts to educational camps at the ANSDU and the mentoring of high school and undergraduate students through the Students Tackling Advanced Research (STAR) Scholars in Natural Sciences programs. <br/><br/>The Fellow will use the oscillation hypothesis of symbiont diversification as a framework to test the effect of host breadth on parasite geographic range evolution and diversification. This research will utilize malaria parasites isolated from a geographically and taxonomically expansive collection of avian tissues located at the ANSDU and the Field Museum of Natural History. Malaria parasite genetic data will be collected using a novel exon capture probe design to estimate a robust phylogeny for the group and thousands of avian tissue samples will be tested for malaria infection to estimate parasite host breadth and geographic range size metrics. Data from this project will be analyzed using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for associations between host breadth evolution, geographic range shifts, and malaria diversification. To promote the use of and increase accessibility of project outcomes, all products from this research will be made available on public repositories (GenBank, Dryad, ParaSite, MalAvi). In addition, specimens involved in this research will be vouchered in public research institutions, and the research will be published in open-access journals.<br/><br/>Keywords: Diversification, Host breadth, Malaria parasites, Oscillation Hypothesis, Phylogenomics, Sequence Capture<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cognition arises from the activity within complex brain circuits.  These brain circuits are laid out according to a species' genetic blueprint.  Past and current successes in uncovering the biological basis of cognition include the discovery of areas in the human brain supporting specific cognitive functions, the determination of the roles that specific cell types play in the behavior of animals like the mouse, and the increasingly detailed understanding of the impact specific genes and their alterations can have on cognitive functions in health and disease.  The goal of this interdisciplinary project, conducted at The Rockefeller University, is to directly determine the genetic specificity of brain circuit elements that are critically important for high-level cognitive function.  This project will be significant by 1) elucidating the complexity of biological organization from the level of genes, through cell types, brain areas, and neural circuits to behavior, 2) developing new technology that will allow researchers to dissect brain circuits underlying cognition with the precision and specificity of model organisms, and 3) improving the understanding of how genetic alterations impact cognition.  The interdisciplinary project at the interface of cognitive neuroscience, neural systems, and neurotechnology, is expected to have broader impacts on society by providing insights into some of the deepest questions about the human mind and by offering unique educational and outreach opportunities to improve public understanding of the organization and function of the brain.<br/><br/>The project will investigate the genetic specificity of a multi-node brain circuit that supports cognitive function.  The circuit will be localized with functional and structural magnetic brain imaging.  Genetic expression patterns of projection neurons within multiple circuit nodes will then be determined using cutting edge molecular techniques.  The functions of the projection neurons linking the nodes will then be determined through advanced and custom-designed optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques.  The same optogenetic approach will then be used for causal interrogation of projection neurons in cognitive and emotional behaviors.  Combining the gene expression and functional data, predictions for how specific polymorphisms in human genes may alter cognitive-emotional abilities will be generated. These predictions will be tested through functional brain imaging and behavioral testing of genotyped subjects.  Together, these investigations will provide deep insights into the brain circuits and genetic underpinnings that make possible the cognitive functions of the human mind."

This project will further our knowledge of how the diverse life cycles seen throughout organisms are generated and maintained.  The echinoid echinoderms (sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea biscuits) display a wide variety of life cycles with some species producing offspring that leave their mother as juveniles, while other species produce offspring which spend over a year as a larva before developing into a juvenile. These developmental differences have important impacts on the connection and persistence of populations.  This project will use biological collections to investigate how the life cycles of echinoderms have changed throughout the fossil record, how quickly developmental changes can arise, and how those life cycles affect broader biological patterns such as species ranges and rates of extinction. As part of this project, the fellow will partner with the education department at California Academy of Sciences to engage elementary school students.  The fellow will add information about marine life cycles to classroom kits for local teachers to use in their schools.  She will also participate in the Academy's distance learning program ""Talk to a Scientist"" which schools across the US can teleconference into. This project will contribute to undergraduate training, as the fellow will mentor REU students.  Additionally this project will contribute to the digitization of museum archives. <br/><br/>For this project, the fellow will create a phylogeny of the echinoderm genus Clypeaster (composed of the sea biscuits) using both genetic and morphological data.  She will measure morphological features of extant and extinct species to determine the egg size and larval type of each species.  By combining a phylogeny with these developmental data, the fellow will analyze how developmental patterns have evolved throughout the history of this group, how stable developmental type is, and how quickly changes in developmental type can arise. The genus Clypeaster provides an exceptional and rare opportunity to test many core Evo-Devo theories due to the extensive literature on the development of extant species, its remarkably complete fossil record, and the ability to determine developmental traits from fossilized adults.  The phylogeny and morphological database created for this project will serve as a resource for other scientists.  Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared at scientific meetings."

To date most research on the performance of plants under different environmental conditions has been conducted with a limited number of differences, such as a single environmental stress versus control (unstressed) conditions. The Enviratron will permit researchers to incrementally alter multiple critical variables to better simulate changing conditions that will be faced in the future. The Enviratron will be an important research and training tool for students in the plant sciences, particularly for underrepresented minorities who will participate in the project through the George Washington Carver Summer Research Internship Program. It will provide them with the experience of simulating different environmental conditions or different climates of the world and the opportunity to study and improve the performance of plants under those conditions. It will also inspire engineering students to learn how to work hand in hand with plant scientists. The Enviratron will also be a demonstration centerpiece open to farmers and other visitors to promote appreciation and a better understanding of agricultural research.<br/><br/>Understanding how organisms in the biosphere can adapt to climate change is one of the grand scientific challenges of these times. This project creates a phenomics platform that will enable researchers to non-destructively monitor the performance of plants throughout their lifecycle under variable environmental conditions. The Enviratron represents a revolutionary new design in plant phenomics facilities. It consists of an array of plant growth chambers to create different environmental conditions. Unlike commercial plant phenomics systems, plants will not be conveyed out of the growth chambers to monitor their growth performance, rather a rover with a robotically controlled arm will periodically visit each chamber to image and analyze the plants. In addition to more standard visible light, fluorescence, near infrared and infrared imaging, sensors on the rover will be capable of imaging and conducting analyses not available on commercial systems such as hyperspectral and holographic imaging and Raman spectroscopy. The robot-assisted sensing approach will enable precise location-specific data acquisition, resulting in improved sampling strategies and data quality. The Enviratron will be used for research as well as graduate and undergraduate student training and will be located in a facility where it can be used to educate the public about climate change research."

The oVert TCN is creating high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) data for internal anatomy across the diversity of vertebrate animals.  Using computed tomography (CT) scanners at institutional collections across the US, more than 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens will be scanned and made available online for open public use.  This PEN complements the oVert TCN program by including vertebrate animals too large to be preserved in fluid or scanned by conventional CT scanners.  The oMEGA PEN will use portable surface scanners to provide high-resolution scans of skeletons of large vertebrate animals curated at Harvard, Berkeley, and California Academy of Sciences.  The addition of large vertebrates, including whales and elephants, provides an important segment of the animal world to open access collections for researchers and educators.  The process of creating this 3D resource will provide training for undergraduate students, and on-site workshops for collections staff.  Skeletal models will support TCN activities in creating K-12 STEM lesson plans and 3D-printable resources for the classroom.  <br/><br/>The digitized skeletons acquired in this PEN will help fill a major gap in the original TCN and support its research theme on the evolution of vertebrate morphological diversity.  By virtue of their large size, vertebrates exceeding 250 kg define upper boundaries of size-dependent anatomical form and function, and therefore push the limits on development and physiology.  These skeletal data will provide new opportunities to evaluate gigantism and the tendency of animal lineages toward ever-larger body size.  Combined with the other oVert 3D specimens, the TCN's digital collection distributed through MorphoSource and iDigBio will inspire new research questions and provide the raw materials to test hypotheses in a broad range of biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Forrestel<br/><br/>Proposal Number: 1612237<br/><br/>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Elisabeth Forrestel is ""Linking phenology and functional traits to climate responses of diverse winegrapes"" The host institutions for this fellowship are Harvard University and INRA Montpellier (France), and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Elizabeth Wolkovich and Thierry Lacombe.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how altered temperature and precipitation together affect the coordination of plant functional traits and their associated ecosystem services. The Fellow is exploring this question by studying the coordination of plant phenology and a suite of plant functional traits related to water use and drought tolerance in winegrapes (Vitis vinifera L.). Understanding how plants respond to multiple environmental drivers is a fundamental goal of both plant physiological and functional ecology. To date, however, research has focused on a limited set of trait responses to single environmental variables, severely limiting our understanding of how altered temperature and precipitation together will affect the coordination of plant functional traits. In particular, phenology, i.e., the timing of recurring life history events, is rarely incorporated into studies of plant function. This is despite the fact that a change in phenology is the most widely observed response of plants to climate change. The Fellow is using the world's two largest living collections of winegrapes at the French National Institute of Agriculture (INRA Domaine de Vassal) in Southern France and the USDA National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Tree Fruit, Nut Crops and Grapes in Winters, California. The winegrapes in these collections vary over two months in ripening time and also exhibit a wide range of functional diversity. The Fellow is transcribing phenological records, and measuring physiological and functional traits on a diverse set of varieties in these collections to test for the coordination between plant functional strategies and phenological shifts in response to climate. The Fellow is also using these data to build biologically realistic phenological models and make the first robust predictions of climate change effects on wine growing regions.<br/><br/>The Fellow is gaining expertise in climate and phenological modeling, and integrating perspectives from ecological and agricultural sciences into her research repertoire. She is also establishing important international and interdisciplinary collaborations. The Fellow's research is yielding results that are highly relevant to the future of an economically and culturally important crop, and all data generated including phenological models and projections are being made publicly available. The Fellow is also mentoring undergraduates, and is actively engaging the community with her research. In collaboration with botanists and chefs, the Fellow is offering public seminars and dinner series focused on the evolutionary and cultural history of food, which includes her work on winegrapes. In conjunction with the series, the Fellow is developing teaching modules for high school and undergraduate students, in which students keep journals on the evolutionary history of what the foods they eat, in order to explore and appreciate plant diversity."

Genotypes are used to predict the phenotype in breeding programs, for traits like flowering time, seed weight or oil yield. Marker genotypes for such traits are currently determined in targeted sequencing experiments, termed genotype-by-sequencing (GBS). GBS has drastically reduced the cost of detecting genetic variants and determining the genotypes of individuals, thus making high-throughput genotyping more accessible within the fields of agriculture and ecology.  However, marker genotypes determined using GBS are frequently incorrect because, due to random chance, some alleles do not get sequenced in some individuals.  Polyploidy further complicates the issue of genotype ambiguity because genotypes can no longer simply be classified as homozygous or heterozygous, but instead are defined by the number of copies of each allele that they possess.  This project aims to develop methodology and software for quantifying uncertainty in DNA marker genotypes determined by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), particularly in polyploid species, and for incorporating that uncertainty into analyses that relate genotype to phenotype. Given that many economically-important crops are polyploid, genotyping improvements that result from this project will be especially beneficial for securing the world's supply of food, fuel, and fiber through marker-assisted plant breeding.  This project will result in increased sensitivity for identifying marker alleles that are associated with phenotypic differences, as well as improved prediction of phenotypes from GBS data.  More broadly, it will promote a paradigm shift in the field, treating genotypes as probability distributions rather than values that are known with certainty.  Additionally, YouTube videos teaching linear algebra as well as computer programming in Python and R will be created during the course of this project, making these concepts more accessible for students in the biological sciences.<br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to (1) create an algorithm that estimates genotype probabilities in diploids and polyploids as accurately as possible from GBS data and (2) create genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) methodologies that fully utilize genotype probabilities.  An iterative algorithm will be developed that will generate a probability distribution of each individual being each possible genotype at a given locus.  The algorithm will use read depth at each of two or more alleles and will model multiple biological and technical parameters, including allele frequencies, population structure, inbreeding, linkage disequilibrium, inheritance mode, differential amplification, and sample contamination.  The algorithm will be implemented in a publicly-available R package that will integrate with existing GBS bioinformatics pipelines and will output multiple formats suitable for downstream analysis.  New GWAS and GS methods will be developed that model both additive and dominance effects while utilizing genotype probability distributions, and will build upon existing software for GWAS and GS.  Diploid and tetraploid populations of the bioenergy grass Miscanthus will be used for validating and improving the new methodologies.  GBS and phenotyping have already been performed or are underway on these populations.  Software produced as a result of this project will be hosted at https://github.com/lvclark/polyRAD and https://github.com/lvclark/GAPITdom ."

Eight percent of the human genome derives from retroviruses; these viral sequences differentiate the human genome from that of other primates. Within microbial communities, including those living in association with animal hosts, viruses are the most numerically abundant microorganisms, outnumbering all cellular microbes by 10 to 1,000 fold.  These natural viral communities are genetically diverse, containing a vast number of novel and unknown genes.  In the oceans, viral breakdown of microbial cells contributes to the chemical transformation of carbon and nutrient elements.  Ultimately, these transformations impact the productivity of marine ecosystems as well as regional and global climate.  While understanding of extant viral diversity and the role of viruses within natural systems is still rudimentary, there is evidence that viruses play critically important roles in the biology, ecology, and evolution of life on earth. <br/><br/>This project will enhance a newly developed computational tool, the Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenome Exploration (VIROME) to better facilitate the coming wave of discoveries surrounding the role of viruses in natural systems.  In particular, we will pursue three specific developmental goals: 1) leverage sources of long-length DNA sequence data to improve the quality of the information output from the VIROME bioinformatics pipeline; 2) utilize the VIROME gene classification scheme to develop a sustainable database of unknown viral genes, i.e., viral genetic dark matter; and 3) advance the sustainability of the VIROME resource through virtualization of its underlying computational workflow.<br/><br/>Given that viruses impact life on earth over evolutionary time and global scales, further development of VIROME will benefit researchers in the life sciences, engineering, and geosciences.  The project?s impact will be enhanced by directly training graduate and undergraduate students and by conducting twice yearly workshops on the use of VIROME for the analysis of viral metagenome sequence data.  The project will also advance public understanding of the emerging scientific consensus surrounding the nuanced and critical impacts of viruses on cellular life by hosting an informational booth at Ag Day, a public outreach event reaching thousands of residents in the quad state vicinity of the University of Delaware, Newark campus (DE, MD, PA, & NJ).  Lastly, the team will reach out to K-12 students by hosting an annual ?Get to know viruses? STEM program at the Delaware Biotechnology Institute for groups of Cub Scouts and Girl Scouts in the Newark, Delaware area."

A portable device for protein analysis virtually impacts all fields of biology and also the biomedical sciences. Protein analysis of environmental samples typically requires collecting and storing samples and returning weeks to months later in labs to begin analyzing the data. The proposed instrument will instead allow for point-of-use on the field analysis of biological samples. The result of this research will be an instrument that is handheld and generalizable to the needs of individual biological laboratories. This disruptive tool will be valuable for basic biology, as well as clinical, biotechnological, and agricultural research. This tool will also have greater societal benefits including improving agricultural practices and deeper insights into environmental biology, which is necessary for protecting the environment. This is multidisciplinary work that combines engineering, nanofabrication, chemistry, physics, and biology and provides a great opportunity to educate and train graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.  One of the important educational outcomes of the proposed research includes building teaching modules that will be incorporated into a massive open online course (MOOC) in biosensor and bioinstrumentation development. Collaborations will be developed with the Rutgers Office for Diversity and Academic Success in the Sciences to attract under-represented students to the study of STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The proposed sample-to-answer portable protein analyzer to be developed will utilize 1) on-chip microfluidic sample preparation, 2) decoupled digital protein detection for quantification of low abundance proteins 3) nanoelectronic barcoding of beads for enabling multiplexing capability, and 4) on-chip magnet based fluidic peristaltic pumping for maintaining an ultra-compact footprint. Nanoelectronic barcoding works by fabricating tunable nano-capacitors on the microparticle surface, effectively modulating the frequency dependent dielectric properties of the particles allowing one bead barcode to be distinguished from another, potentially on the scale of 100-fold multiplexing. By using electronic based solutions for all of the key modules of the proposed instrument, the cost and size of the readout instrumentation can be significantly reduced, thus truly enabling on-the-field analysis. The devices will be validated in the field with environmental samples, benchmarking for detection limit, accuracy, and assay time for a panel of photosynthesis proteins from the green alga Picochlorum. The results will be shared with the engineering and experimental biology communities via presentations at professional meetings and submission to peer-reviewed journals. The research value of the instrument will be broadly disseminated through partnerships with the Rutgers BioMAPS Institute for Quantitative Biology and the Rutgers Center for Integrated Proteomic Research. To prepare for commercialization of the technology and broad distribution, there will be close collaboration with the Rutgers Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies and the Rutgers Office of Technology Commercialization."

These powerful instruments are widely used in many fields of basic research for identification and rapid isolation of living cells on the basis of size/shape and the color of their fluorescence after incubation with specific dyes.  Four major faculty users and seven minor faculty users in three different departments on campus will benefit from the use of this state-of-the-art instrument in their research, which permits experiments that are not currently possible. The FACS will be widely used by undergraduate and graduate students directly as part of their research training.  Additionally, students in several courses on campus will receive hands-on training on sample preparation, data collection and analysis, which provides them with important laboratory skills. Underrepresented minority students in other campus programs will be actively recruited to participate in these research activities. These unique opportunities support the institution's goal for students to engage in high-quality, high-impact educational experiences.<br/><br/>The FACS accommodates particles of many sizes ranging from bacteria to very large cells. Multiple lasers allow for simultaneous detection of numerous different parameters and mixtures of cells can be rapidly isolated to greater than 99% purity.  This instrument will enable interdisciplinary research on white blood cells and immune function in reptiles, aging and the immune system in mice, disease ecology in bumblebees, host-parasite interactions in insects, separation and study of avian blood cells, analysis of Leishmania parasites, study of neuron function in the insect brain, and studies on pollen production in plants. Acquisition of this instrument will also help recruit and retain talented faculty, including women.  The results of these diverse studies can have wide-ranging impact from disease ecology to conservation efforts to understanding basic cell functions and will have a significant impact on research productivity at Illinois State University."

Collaboratively, these two groups will develop common learning standards about the concepts underlying an experiment and the nature of representations students should apply in reasoning about experiments and visualizing data.  They also will evaluate existing assessments and create and validate new assessments based on the standards to reveal areas of student difficulties, leading to new instructional and mentoring approaches targeting those areas.<br/><br/>While an increasing number of studies focus on helping students decipher the experimental research process in general, most assessment tools only indirectly measure what undergraduates learn from performing biology experiments. The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses the need to develop assessments that directly measure what students learn about biology research to strengthen their research skills. It is envisaged that these assessments will have both summative and formative applications as activities for promoting learning about experimental research competencies.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project lie in the fact that faculty involved in the project come from a variety of biology sub-disciplines at different career levels and from a wide range of institutions, providing an opportunity for liberal arts colleges and master's-degree-granting institutions, in particular, to provide input to the development of assessments that can positively impact their students.

The genome of this yeast was sequenced 20 years ago, yet nearly 10% of the genes have no assigned function; these genes are called orphan genes. Determining the function of the complete set of genes in this simple model organism will meaningfully contribute to the understanding of how cells function. The goal of the Yeast Orphan Gene Project is to organize a consortium of undergraduate student researchers and faculty to coordinate resources and design experimental strategies to assign functions to orphan genes in yeast.<br/><br/>Based on analysis of available bioinformatics data sets, students will design and execute experiments for defining gene function. The network will facilitate collaboration between students at different institutions so that students can share strategies and technique solutions while developing experience in on-line collaborations. Scientifically, the project will contribute to a more detailed understanding of the biology of yeast and the structure of the yeast genome. Ultimately, the yeast orphan gene project aims to use the process of determining orphan gene function as a tool to teach undergraduate students key concepts in bioinformatics, genomics, molecular biology, and genetics and impart valuable experience in scientific collaboration and leadership. The network will provide tools for faculty to expand research experience for undergraduates and incorporate research experiences into undergraduate courses. It will also be a mechanism to distribute a tested model of an authentic course-based research experience to a diverse set of institutions by providing workshop and assessment support. Through sharing of resources, the network will develop a model for online course modules to be shared among institutions.

Modern phylogenetic analyses involve obtaining DNA sequence data from a set of organisms, and using model-based methods to infer a binary tree that reflects how closely the organisms are related to one another. This tree represents the evolutionary history of the organisms going back to their most recent common ancestor and is, in essence, a subset of the overall tree of life. In addition to providing a basic understanding of the evolution of life, these phylogenetic relationships are very important in understanding the evolutionary dynamics, timing, and spread of many disease-causing organisms, such as viruses (e.g., hiv, flu, and Ebola). The most effective phylogenetic inferences involve statistical methods, either maximum likelihood or Bayesian analysis. Both of these methods share the same computational bottleneck, which is the calculation of the likelihood of proposed trees. These likelihood calculations are extremely computationally intensive, and hence accurate phylogenetic analyses become a bottleneck in many studies of the tree of life. Therefore, accelerating phylogenetic analyses is critical to produce timely results that can inform public health and disease containment actions, as well as to understand fundamental problems in evolutionary biology more broadly. This project increases the performance and capabilities of software that will in crease the speed of analyses, and thus decrease the time to scientific results.<br/><br/>The Broad-platform Evolutionary Analysis General Likelihood Evaluator (BEAGLE) library and Application Programming Interface (API) is a high-performance likelihood-calculation platform for evolutionary models. It defines a uniform API and includes a collection of efficient implementations for calculating a variety of likelihood-based models on different hardware devices, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and multicore cpus. The project provides new thinking to the problem of computing the likelihood function in evolutionary analyses through configuring concurrent communication by moving computation that previously required multiple BEAGLE instances into a single instance. Operating under a single beagle instance allows better coordination of concurrent communication, by, for example, reducing memory transfers as well as by load-balancing the computation across potentially heterogeneous devices. The emphasis on concurrency originates from a deep understanding of the specific characteristics of the computational problem - computing the likelihood function - and how it is used for analyses within the domain sciences - phylogenetics and population genetics, and recognizing the opportunities presented by trends in processor design for increasing concurrency. The overarching theme comprises the following recurring sub-themes: i) reformulation - identifying and decomposing computation into practical independent operations; ii) minimization - reducing operations, such as memory transfers and execution overhead; and iii) control - configuring flow and communication to maximize concurrency, including across devices. The research project reformulates the library and its api, and focuses on consolidating more capabilities into a single library instance through the following research initiatives: 1. exploiting additional concurrency within a library instance, thus improving concurrent communication by reformulation and minimization; 2. developing the library to fully leverage multi-device systems, thus improving concurrent communication by controlling load-balancing; 3. exploring numerical precision and scaling in parallel computing context; and 4. extending the capabilities of the library with new models for statistical phylogenetics and population genetics."

This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public.

For biological specimens, information digitized include names of species, localities and dates of collection, digital photographs, sound, video, and 3-D models created from a variety of sources. This community digitization effort is supported by ADBC through Thematic Collections Networks (TCNs), groups of institutions that digitize specimens to address a major research topic such as the relationship between agricultural crops and insects or the impacts of invasive species on natural ecosystems. iDigBio assists in coordinating activities of the TCNs by facilitating development of standards and workflows for digitization of specimens and related information, providing cyberinfrastructure resources to enable long-term preservation of digital data, promoting novel and traditional uses of collections data in research and outreach, and working with the collections community to plan for the long-term sustainability of the national program and the resources that program has produced. The availability of digitized information about specimens greatly enhances the ability to conduct research on biological diversity and to address some of the most fundamental questions in biology. <br/><br/>In the past five years, the national effort to digitize information in the nation's biodiversity collections has been successfully catalyzed by funding from NSF and advanced by activities of iDigBio. Collaborations with data providers and users have been developed, goals and priorities defined, and best practices related to digitization identified. Cyberinfrastructure resources, including a national search portal, have been provided. These community-driven activities have led to improved digitization practices, increased involvement in digitization and training, and adoption of instruments and informatics tools that improve the efficiency and scalability of digitization and research workflows in all types of biodiversity collections. iDigBio works with staff in more than 450 collections in 270 institutions distributed in all 50 states. Communication among stakeholders to increase access to collections data has been established through workshops, webinars, and the use of social media. iDigBio has sponsored attendance of more than 2,200 participants from 511 institutions to over 65 workshops and symposia that targeted digitization. iDigBio has ingested more than 670 record sets containing 48 million records and 13 million images. All data ingested are indexed so that queries and other types of index-based access are supported. Searches for data can be done through a Web-based graphical interface or through programmatic APIs. Search and analytical tools enable users to mine diverse data such as taxonomy, location, images, traits, and vocalizations. Funding for another five years, will allow iDigBio to continue its successful strategies with an increasing emphasis on data improvement and use in research and outreach. This national resource created by the ADBC program is increasingly recognized as an essential resource for information on biodiversity and digitization. As the scientific and societal benefits of validated collections data are realized, digitization will become a common and sustained practice in natural history collections."

Population genomics (the study of diversity in the genomic DNA of populations instead of individuals) has important applications in agriculture, anthropology, conservation, medicine, and several other fields of biology. Recent technology advances have greatly lowered the cost of DNA sequencing so large amounts of data are available. At the same time statisticians have developed new methods for analyzing large collections of genome-sized data. Combining the data with the new analysis approaches can let scientists answer fundamental questions about the biology of species that have never before been accessible. However, most population genomics studies fail to take advantage of the latest population genomics statistical methods. This is because the genomic data requires a lot of processing to prepare it for the analysis steps, and these operations are not easy to learn. Lack of bioinformatics knowledge has led to erroneous conclusions, irreproducible results, incomplete analyses, and slow turnaround time of population genomics projects. This project aims to provide software that can handle those tasks in a consistent and correct way and allow direct access to the statistical tools, to bring about new insights in population biology. <br/><br/>This project will address the largest impediments to model-based population genomics by building a user-friendly and intuitive pipeline platform, the ""Pop-gen Pipeline Platform"" (PPP). This platform will help researchers avoid the problems inherent in re-inventing data processing scripts to feed data into their population genomics analyses, and considerably reduce time and effort. PPP will include tested scripts and pipelines for data preparation, and in addition the tools needed to build evolutionary models, carry out analyses of data, and create visualization of results via the Ruffus Computation Pipeline Library in Python. PPP will also be developed as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) under the popular and robust Galaxy Project (www.galaxyproject.org) for bioinformatics analyses. An online server deploying Galaxy/PPP will be developed and maintained at Temple University, Philadelphia (www.dev3.cst.temple.edu) for users to interactively submit jobs on a first-come-first-served basis. Online forums will be established for support, and to collect suggestions regarding what is desired for further development under PPP. Tutorials and videos about example applications of the PPP will be added to the Galaxy Project Wikipedia training channels. Additionally, a significant part of this work will involve educating Temple University seniors, Philadelphia area high school teachers, and their students about the power of bioinformatics in modern biology through summer workshops. Information about PPP, and associated developments can be accessed at https://bio.cst.temple.edu/~hey/software/software.htm."

Cannon (Iowa State University)<br/> <br/>Legumes play a central role in food security and nearly every cropping system worldwide. Among cultivated plants, legumes such as beans, peas and lentils are unique in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen which is converted into a soluble organic form that can be taken up by plants through symbiosis with a soil bacterium. Approximately 33% of all nutritional nitrogen comes from legumes which are the most important source of protein in most developing countries. Genomic resources have been or are being developed for many legume crops, but the fragmented nature of these data resources limits the ability of researchers to leverage information generated in one species to infer function or identify candidate genes in another species. The overarching goal of this project is to address this deficiency by developing software and methods for a ""Legume Federation"" (LF) of diverse, independently funded and geographically separated genomic data portals (GDPs). The LF will facilitate utilization of genomic, genetic and phenotypic information across a wide range of legume species that will allow researchers and breeders to take full advantage of the data that are currently available at the GDPs. The project will provide research training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds at different educational levels. In the context of outreach, the project will pro-actively engage the community of legume data providers through presentations and workshops at national and international meetings as well as through a central web portal that will provide information describing project goals, methods of implementation and progress reports to the community. <br/> <br/>The pace of data collection across crop and model plants has increased dramatically. Most crop species have both a data management problem and great opportunities to access genetic ""big data"". The objectives of this project are to develop a federation model for legume databases, to facilitate data exchange across a wide range of legume species to enable cross-species translational genomics, and to adapt an existing set of open-source tools for biological information management that will provide a framework for project-oriented data management enabling both long-term integration and widespread use. The specific goals are to: <br/> <br/>1). Adopt and port the data currently managed in each of the custom frameworks into a set of well-integrated, open source model organism database tools;<br/>2). Define data formats, metadata standards, data exchange and Web service protocols to facilitate communications between species-centric databases at various levels; <br/>3). Utilize orthology, synteny, and mappings of other significant features to integrate genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data across legume species, to enable identification of common molecular bases for important traits and enable traversal across database projects;<br/>4). Improve the capacity of organism database projects to collect and manage complex phenotype data using ontologies, controlled vocabularies and well-defined protocols and schemas; and, <br/>5). Facilitate productive data exchange by implementing a common, open, virtualized Data Repository for data exchange across sites and for stable, long-term archiving of data sets, standardized metadata, and robust methods for archiving, searching, and accessing data sets from federated GDPs.<br/> <br/>It is anticipated that the LF will provide a model for a well-accepted open-source technology stack that can be adopted by other research communities that have limited resources or technical expertise. All data will be freely available to the general public through the project web site and through the associated GDPs that include but are not limited to MedicagoGenome (http://medicagogenome.org), SoyBase (http://soybase.org), PeanutBase (http://peanutbase.org), and the Legume Information System (http://legumeinfo.org)."

No such centralized repository currently exists, although biologists have been collecting data on the rates with which individuals survive, grow, and reproduce for many decades, and from tens of thousands of populations around the world. These fundamental biological data can inform a range of scientific research within and outside of the field of biology, including understanding why certain populations go extinct or become invasive, and predicting how species may respond to anthropogenic pressures and global change. By developing a single, standardized platform for storing and analyzing these demographic data, this project will yield an important resource for a range of users. For example, researchers will be able to directly contribute their datasets into the repository, as well as to link these demographic data with other databases (e.g. on species distributions, genetic sequences, climate projections) to conduct large-scale comparative studies. Teachers and students will be able to explore variations in life cycles and carry out basic analyses by following the exercises and tutorials that will accompany the database. Finally, managers of threatened species can use these demographic data to better understand the needs of their populations and compare the impacts of different management strategies (e.g., increasing breeding compared to increasing offspring survival). <br/><br/>The demographic rates of survival, growth, and reproduction are the basic units for measuring how populations change in size and structure through time and space. As such, these demographic data serve as key resources for a range of biological research, from understanding the evolution of life histories to predicting species responses to global change. Moreover, demographic studies tend to follow a standardized protocol for data collection and presentation in the form of matrix population models (MPMs). This standardization provides a rare opportunity to conduct large-scale comparative analyses across the tree of life. The scientific literature currently contains MPMs for >1,500 plant species and >2,000 animal species worldwide, often with several populations for each species. The distinctive data structure and standardized analyses for MPMs necessitate a uniform, centralized repository to maximize the utility of these valuable data. This project aims to develop an open-access repository of MPMs, which will allow researchers to leverage decades of demographic monitoring to conduct comparative analyses at global, regional, and local scales. The proposed work involves developing a robust relational database management system for MPMs, building upon existing efforts by an international team of demographic experts and data users on the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. The team will create a publicly accessible interface to facilitate data usage and enable researchers to directly contribute their MPM datasets through a standardized data entry portal. Additionally, the project's senior personnel will develop tutorials and teaching materials, and conduct a series of workshops to engage current and potential users of the repository including researchers, educators, and conservation managers.

Recent research citing the collection exemplifies how new and unpredicted scientific paradigms, environmental issues, and technological advances require the existence of extensive and accessible historical scientific collections. Genetics, molecular phylogenetics, museomics, biomechanics, global change, emerging diseases, and invasive species are research areas for which specimens from this collection have recently been used. Based on recommendations from recent assessments that identified a number of urgent challenges affecting the collection and its related data, Carnegie Museum of Natural History has developed an extensive plan to preserve and increase access to the collection, ensuring that this important resource is sustained and able to support research for generations to come. <br/><br/>Ranking tenth among US collections of its kind, the Herpetology Collection at Carnegie Museum of Natural History spans more than 100 years of scientific collecting in 170 countries. It includes 148 holotypes and 2,007 paratypes (specimens of special scientific and historic significance used in the original species descriptions), specimens of six extinct and 78 critically endangered species, and one of the world's largest turtle collections. Through this award, Carnegie Museum of Natural History will: a) optimize storage space to improve curation and access and mitigate preservation risks due to overcrowding and suboptimal containers; b) digitize vouchered archival data related to specific specimens, providing vital context for the collection; c) accession and catalog ca. 12,000 specimens, georeference locality data, and make data and images of holotypes and paratypes digitally accessible; d) update taxonomy throughout the Section and reorganize the collection accordingly; e) enhance the public's appreciation of the value of collections and research by developing new collections-based programs and exhibits. Ensuring the long-term preservation and availability of the Section's specimens and related data is key for supporting future research efforts. Likewise, digitizing important archival records will expand the relevance of the collection for studies in ecology, systematics, conservation, and the history of natural history collections. Updating taxonomy and georeferencing additional records will enhance the precision of biodiversity data, improving usefulness to the global research community. In addition, collaborative planning will lead to the implementation of new educational programming and two new museum exhibits designed to enhance the public's appreciation of the value of collections for research and increase understanding of the collection's importance in the public's day-to-day life.

These leading-edge I/H methods integrate information from different sources to determine the structures of complex biomolecular assemblies, analogous to assembling the pieces of a puzzle to build a three-dimensional object. Some of the landmark structures determined using I/H methods include the nuclear pore complex that enables the transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane and the proteasomal lid sub-complex that regulates the degradation of damaged, malfunctioning or toxic proteins in the cell. There is currently no repository capable of archiving these I/H structures so that they are available for downstream scientific and biomedical applications. The current project builds a comprehensive software pipeline to support the validation, curation and dissemination of I/H models so that they are freely available to the broader community. The outcomes of this project will make key structures of biological assemblies accessible to researchers, educators and students around the world. This project will impact scientists who use structural biology data for their research as well as students and educators who study the role of structure in biology. This research will directly and significantly enhance the field of biology and medicine and extend its impact on the broader community through education and outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project extends a previously developed prototype system (PDB-Dev) by building the complete data pipeline for the curation, validation and delivery of I/H models. This will be achieved through the creation of an automated deposition system to support a broad range of I/H models; development of annotation and validation pipelines for processing I/H models by leveraging existing protocols and tools; development of new tools for visualizing multi-scale model representations and model uncertainly; creation of a service architecture to manage data exchange among federated resources capable of supporting evolutionary improvements of I/H models and associated experimental data; and development of a delivery platform to support data set discovery and to provide web services for searching, reporting, and data download. Since I/H methods integrate information from several experimental and computational techniques, this project also prototypes a new centralized software environment that facilitates automated communication and exchange of data among a federation of structural biology model and data repositories contributing to I/H modeling. These developments will lead to a robust system capable to archiving and disseminating I/H models to the public in a standard form.

The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. <br/><br/>It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project. The progress of the AFP-SIG and CAFA will be available from http://BioFunctionPrediction.org"

Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. <br/><br/>The specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

Biological functions are carried out through the myriad interactions of biological molecules, such as when proteins bind to other proteins to modulate their activity or to nucleic acids to regulate genes. DNA sequencing has led to an explosive growth in data reporting genomic sequences and their variations, and gene expression through transcript profiling; the data streams from high-throughput technologies for protein and metabolite profiling are quickly catching up. This has led to ever-expanding repositories that archive, organize and share the resulting data: by also connecting experimental conditions to the molecular profiles, researchers come to understand which molecular interactions occur and, from these, deduce many of the biological functions in living cells. Extraction of meaningful biological insights from these data sets is challenging in two ways: the data sets are very large so they require computational methods for basic handling, and each type of data differs from the others in many ways (type of noise, source of error, completeness, etc.) so they may require different statistical modeling to standardize them correctly prior to merging them. Carried out correctly, the resulting high-dimensional data sets are suitable for a variety of predictive analytics that reveal functional modules in the molecular interactomes. Results from this project will be made available through webservers and open source software. The integrated research and educational activities include interdisciplinary bioinformatics curriculum development, outreach to high school students and research opportunities for students in underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Comprehensively understanding various functional aspects of a gene or a protein, such as involvement in a particular biological process, physical/genetic interactions, or disease association, is critical for both biology and translational medicine research. Since exhaustively characterizing genes or proteins through biological experiments is often intractable, systems-level integration of knowledge and computational hypothesis generation have garnered great interest in the field as an effective way to guide experiments. In this project, we will develop a novel computational framework for data integration and dimensionality reduction of heterogeneous network and functional genomic data to obtain informative data representations in a low-dimensional vector space. To utilize both molecular networks and evolutionary information, we will apply the proposed dimensionality reduction techniques to effectively integrate sequence data and network data across multiple species for predicting gene function.  Our approaches will enable large-scale, integrated, cross-species, genome-scale gene function annotation. Through this integration, our methods can also infer functional homology or analogy between genes, which share weak sequence similarity but relevant biological functions, from different species.

Often a difference in chromosome copy number, which causes a difference in gene dose for those chromosomes, results in a corresponding effect on gene expression, termed a ""dosage effect"". However, in many organisms, special ""dosage compensation"" mechanisms have evolved to mitigate these dosage effects arising from differences in chromosome copies, such as between males and females on the sex-chromosomes. There is increasing interest in understanding which organisms employ dosage compensation mechanisms, and why. Recent advances in genome-wide assays of gene expression have greatly expanded which taxa can be assayed for dosage compensation, but analytical approaches for such data are varied, inconsistently applied, and typically do not make full use of the information available in the data. The methods and software developed from this project, called ""doseR"",  will provide a cohesive and comprehensive solution to each of these issues. As such, the ""doseR"" project fills a major gap that currently exists in analytical methods for genomic investigations of dosage compensation. Furthermore, beyond dosage compensation analysis, this methodology can be generalized to identify broad shifts in gene expression between groups of genes that arise under different biological conditions. Thus, development and deployment of doseR will bridge the gap between biological intuition and bioinformatic inference, not only for dosage compensation, but also for many still as yet unforeseen lines of inquiry. This project also creates several training opportunities for undergraduate students, including intensive bioinformatic training workshops and direct participation in research activities.<br/><br/><br/>This research aims to develop and make broadly available a novel linear-modeling statistical methodology for analyzing sex-chromosome dosage compensation using genome-wide RNA-seq expression data. The statistical approaches currently employed for such analyses are far from ideal given the nature of the data and the desired set of inferences. Currently, biological replicates are averaged into a single measurement per gene and heavily normalized. Then particular effects of gene expression on the sex-chromosome relative to autosomes are evaluated using absolute expression while gene dosage effects are assessed using expression ratios, in both cases using non-parametric statistical tests. A more statistically robust approach is to employ linear mixed-effects modeling of gene expression. This provides a unified statistical framework to assess magnitude and significance of both chromosome-specific and dosage effects on gene expression. Moreover, it is applied directly to the sequencing read counts for each gene and incorporates scaling factors such as sequencing depth and transcript length into the models describing the data, as is done in most analyses of differential expression. As such, extensive normalization is avoided and statistical replicates are readily incorporated into the analysis. These methods will be implemented in a new software package, named ""doseR"", written in the R statistical programming language and distributed as part of the Bioconductor suite of bioinformatic software tools. Performance of the new statistical model and its software implementation relative to previous methods of assessing dosage compensation will be evaluated through extensive simulations of RNA-sequencing data. Application to specific empirical data sets relevant to dosage compensation will also be examined and evaluated. While the immediate motivation for software development is dosage compensation analysis, the proposed methodology can be employed in any analytical scenario requiring the detection of directional shifts in expression for multiple, specific subsets of genes. It therefore provides a tool with broad utility in systems biology research. Status and results of this project can be found at https://walterslab.github.io/doseR/."

Hundreds of biological museums across the U.S. hold the research products from innumerable biotic surveys and inventories, namely millions of curated specimens of animals and plants. Those unique vouchers document the identity and distribution of species across the planet, as well as document geographical patterns of biological diversity. Research based on biological collections not only generates scientific knowledge of species and their distributions, it also employs specimen data in computational models for predicting the biological impacts of climate change. Specimen data are also used for informing national and regional conservation priorities, and in environmental education and professional training. The primary goal of the Specify Project is to provide software to mobilize all of the taxonomic, geographic and ecological information associated with museum specimens to internet-based information portals for public access, policy and research. Specify is used by 284 U.S. research collections to digitize, manage and publish specimen holdings data. The software platform also facilitates the tracking of museum specimen transactions and legal compliance for the acquisition and curation of new collections from earth?s remaining wild places. Specify modernizes and extends the impact of the investment made by biological researchers, leveraging the truly monumental, three-century investment in biological survey and inventory. Specify Project software accomplishes this by facilitating the publication of data previously sequestered in museum cabinets with software support to computerize the information and to bring it to freely-accessible, open access, web information portals. <br/><br/>During the course of this effort, the Specify Software Project will derive and implement a business model to financially support its core software engineering and technical support activities. Through community consensus-gathering activities, we will obtain advice from university administrators, museum and research directors from biological collections institutions around the country in order to identify a revenue model to sustain the technical support activities of the Specify Software Project. We will interview representatives of U.S. research institutions currently using Specify to assess the likelihood of their participation in various fee-based and consortium membership-based options for ongoing Specify support and software updates. In consultation with business advisors we will synthesize the findings of those community activities and propose a revenue structure for financial support of the Specify Project. We will undertake 'sustaining development' (maintenance and completion) of software for the Specify 7 data management platform. The Specify Project will continue to provide technical help desk support services, including outreach and training for U.S. research collections institutions using and adopting Specify for biological specimen data processing.

Time series algorithms have proven to be a powerful computational strategy for understanding transcriptional regulation from gene expression data by using the ordering of events to help identify regulatory interactions. However, there are limits to the quality and types of interactions that can be inferred from bulk gene expression data, which are averaged over many different cells and do not reflect protein post-translational modifications. Single-cell RNA-seq measures gene expression in individual cells, capturing diverse cellular states and fine-grained progression through biological processes. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data reveal the rapid and widespread changes in protein phosphorylation that occur over time during cellular signaling responses. These two types of data have great potential for discovering condition-specific transcriptional regulatory and signaling mechanisms. This project will design novel time series algorithms to improve the prediction of transcriptional and signaling network interactions. These methods will be developed as open source software so that the computational approaches can be adopted in a wide variety of biological systems. Time series data analysis will also be incorporated into local public outreach programs and new training workshops designed to teach computational thinking to biology students.<br/><br/>Biological processes are dynamic, and single-cell gene expression data can provide noisy snapshots of temporal behaviors. Existing computational techniques can estimate each cell's progression through a temporal process from single-cell data, producing cell-specific pseudo-times. These pseudo-time series data are imprecise and irregularly-spaced but contain far more time points than a traditional time series experiment. This project will use causality analysis techniques that require a large number of time points to infer causal gene-gene regulatory relationships. Kernel methods will adapt the causality algorithms to accommodate the heterogeneity of single-cell data and combinatorial nature of transcriptional regulation. To study cellular signaling, computational analysis of time series phosphorylation changes will determine not only which proteins are active in a signaling response but also the temporal intervals in which they are involved. The project will assess both non-stationary Gaussian processes and hidden Markov models for modeling temporal changes in protein phosphorylation. A novel signaling pathway reconstruction algorithm will then flexibly integrate many types of data-derived constraints (for example, early responders cannot be activated by late responders, protein-protein interaction network connectivity relationships, etc.) using statistical relational learning techniques for probabilistic reasoning.

To correctly turn on and off the needed sets of genes requires coordinated action by several hundred regulatory molecules.  The regulators interact with the genome and with each other: understanding how this happens is one of the most important questions biological researchers are trying to answer. This project will use chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, which measures where a particular regulator is located on the genome: this may be zero, one or a few hundred positions out of the billions possible in a genome. Regulators often act together and one may change the action of another, so another part of the proposed work is to discover sites where regulators are co-localized. However, co-localization alone does not show whether regulators interact directly, or indirectly through an intermediate. The overall goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that identifies direct and indirect interactions among regulators, using thousands of ChIP-seq datasets. This framework will develop novel statistical and machine learning techniques to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The techniques that are developed will be applied to answer the following fundamental questions: How do hundreds of regulators interact with each other to regulate the genome? How do these regulator interactions differ across cell types? How do these interactions differ across different species (human, mouse, fly and worm)? The implementation of the new methods will be made publicly available to help many other scientists to study how the human genome works. This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has significant emphasis on interdisciplinary education, through project courses and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Identifying the interactions among chromatin regulators, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is of paramount importance to understand genome regulation. To infer this network of interactions, this research will compare multiple chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets, each measuring genome-wide localization of a chromatin regulator. Co-localization may indicate that two regulators interact directly or indirectly through transitive interactions. To identify direct interactions, the proposal aims to develop novel network inference methods to infer conditional dependence relationships (i.e., correlation not explained via any other variables in the network) among a large number of ChIP-seq datasets. While network inference has become a commonly used analysis tool for other types of data, such as gene expression data, the immense size of the ChIP-seq data sets and the strong redundancies present in the data limit the use of existing network inference methods. To resolve these challenges, this research proposes a novel machine learning (ML) framework to enable network inference from large collections of ChIP-seq data: 1) efficient ML methods to infer the chromatin network based on the entire ENCODE ChIP-seq data that contain redundancies; 2) new ML methods to jointly infer the context-specific chromatin networks and the associated genomic contexts by incorporating other types of genomic data; and 3) new ML methods to learn a conserved chromatin network across species and predict chromatin factor interactions even if the factors are not measured in the species of study.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. There are over 3000 species of catfish, making up roughly one in twenty species of vertebrates. Catfishes are able to lock their fin spines outwards, providing a defense mechanism against predators, and this has been hypothesized to be a key innovation that allowed catfishes to escape predation and radiate. Furthermore, it was recently discovered that in roughly half of all catfishes, these fin spines also deliver venom, and catfishes comprise almost all venomous freshwater vertebrates. Venom has been poorly studied for fishes, including catfishes.  Understanding catfish diversity, evolution and co-evolution of traits (spines and venom) and the role that such adaptations play in species diversification has broad relevance for all vertebrate biology.  <br/><br/>This research project will integrate various types of data, including a new catfish Tree of Life inferred based on phylogenomic data, venom transcriptomic data, computed tomography (CT) scans and photographic data that will derive from biological collections and efforts from the All Catfishes Species Inventory. These data will be integrated using comparative phylogenetics methods to test for shifts in the rates of diversification across catfish phylogeny that were associated with defensive traits and their evolution. The fellow will gain training in generation and analysis of next-generation genomic, transcriptomic, phenomic, and phylogenomic data types. In addition, the fellow will instruct undergraduate level classes and mentor students in research.

The PDB is a key research resource that is essential for our understanding of living systems. It serves a broad community of experimental, structural, and computational scientists, and educators at all levels.  PDB access is provided through primary web and ftp sites (www.pdb.org, ftp.pdb.org) or via multiple mirror sites distributed worldwide.  The PDB will be managed by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology (RCSB), consisting of a partnership between Rutgers, the University of California San Diego and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography to provide a single, searchable archive of accurate and well-annotated data on experimentally determined macromolecular structure.  Systems developed by RCSB are currently being used for data processing, archiving, distribution and query, as well as maintenance of the physical archive. In addition to continued operation of the primary data archiving, ingestion, and dissemination functions, the project will implement several enhancements to the infrastructure associated with the two main operational functions of the archive: data ingestion and processing, and data dissemination. Improvements include provision of a robust, high-throughput pipeline to manage ongoing increases in the volume and complexity of data submitted to PDB, development of query, analysis, visualization, and reporting tools to enhance access to PDB data, and develop a range of education and outreach activities that support the use of PDB data by teachers and students at all educational stages. The result of this effort will be a significant improvement in the utility and value of the Protein Data Bank for both specialists and non-specialists alike. <br/><br/>Mechanisms for increasing the broader impacts of this work include the following:  a series of workshops and meeting sessions, active participation in scientific meetings, a regular newsletter, the on-going use of a help desk to increase the access and utility of PDB for the specialist and non-specialist research community, and use of focus groups to insure maximum usability of PDB data. Participation in graduate and undergraduate coursework design and implementation and in structured research opportunities is being used to increase the impact of PDB on university-level education.  Participation in teacher training workshops and a collaborative effort to launch a teacher development program provide opportunities to bring PDB resources to the K/12 environment.  The general public is being made aware of PDB efforts through a traveling art exhibit and through frequent news releases and informational programs.  Online-based activities like the ?Structural View of Biology? and ?Molecule of the Month? will reach audiences nationally and globally. New activities to be introduced under the current award include increased outreach to under-represented communities and the development of annual theme topics to provide a focus for national integration of education activities involving structural biology. Collectively, these efforts will extend the benefits of PDB resources and activities to the broadest possible community."

Approaches that jointly analyze and interpret multi-omic data provide new understanding of the molecular interplay between genes, proteins and metabolites.  For example, proteogenomics integrates DNA or RNA sequence data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data to identify novel protein variants expressed under different conditions; metaproteomics integrates metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data to identify proteins expressed by microbial communities; metabologenomics integrates genomic and proteomic data with metabolomic profiling data, connecting genotypes to function. To enable new discoveries mined from multi-omic data, the raw data must first be analyzed with specialized, domain specific software.  Unfortunately, the requirement to master and integrate different software for large-scale data analysis discourages many researchers who may otherwise use and benefit from multi-omic approaches in their work.  The goal of this project is to provide a solution to this problem by developing a unified, web-based analytical hub for multi-omic data accessible to bench scientists.  Broader Impact activities will include promotion and dissemination of these software tools to the greater research community and training of undergraduates in bioinformatics via internship projects.<br/><br/>This project will leverage the web-based, user-friendly and research enabling Galaxy bioinformatics workbench.  In addition to proteogenomics and metaproteomics, novel Galaxy extensions will be built to enable data analysis for metabolomics, a field in desperate need of a unified resource to consolidate its many useful but scattered software tools.  Combined with new interactive visualization tools, data exchange features, and deployment in scalable and accessible cloud-based resources, Galaxy's functionality will be significantly enhanced to empower more researchers in multi-omic data analysis.  The project has these Specific Aims: 1) Enhance the Galaxy environment with new interactive visualization tools and data exchange functionalities necessary for effective multi-omic data analysis; 2) Extend the Galaxy environment to analyze and process diverse metabolomics data and support workflows for metabolic activity profiling; 3) Extend the Galaxy environment for integrative genomic-proteomic data analysis supporting proteogenomic and metaproteomic applications; 4) Ensure Broader Impact by promoting usage of Galaxy for multi-omics by the research community and providing undergraduate training opportunities in computational systems biology via a local area institutional network.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Accurately documenting the impacts human activities have on natural populations is a pressing goal in biology. However, in many cases we are limited to studies of present-day populations that exist well after human transformation of the landscape. This presents a major challenge for understanding how different human activities impact populations. Museum collections house long term series of specimens that often span historical, human-induced changes. Recent DNA sequencing advances enable access to genomic data from these specimens, providing an invaluable resource for directly connecting population responses to specific human activities. This project leverages a large series of historic specimens for tidal marsh Savannah Sparrows collected along the California coast over the last 130 years. The fellow will collect morphological and genomic data from these specimens to characterize population responses to salt pond development and urbanization in the San Francisco Bay area.<br/><br/> The fellow will develop a sequence capture array to generate genomic material from Savannah Sparrow specimens collected from multiple localities along the California coast and six time points between the 1880s and the present. Morphological data will also be collected from these specimens. These data will be connected with spatial and temporal data on climate and landscape transformation to understand (1) temporal variation in allele frequencies at loci locally adapted to salinity and temperature variation; (2) the impact of tidal marsh habitat loss to changing patterns of population size and gene flow among tidal marsh populations; and (3) the link between changing demography and selective pressures with divergence in adaptive phenotypic traits. The fellow will receive training in extracting and processing degraded DNA from museum specimens, designing sequence capture arrays, and using the bioinformatic pipelines required to process and analyze this data. Data will be linked to specimens in the museum database Arctos, which will then be used to design undergraduate educational modules that highlight the power of museum resources for biological inference. Undergraduate students at UC Berkeley will be recruited to work on this project. Finally, throughout the San Francisco Bay area there is enormous effort currently underway to restore tidal wetlands. The results from this work will inform management strategies about how much habitat is needed to maintain population sizes and population connectivity at historic levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similar types of vascular networks are essential for the flow of resources in nearly all multicellular organisms, including plants (xylem networks), insects (tracheal networks), and mammals. Understanding which evolutionary principles and environmental factors drive the structure of vascular networks, and what constrains the flow through them, could help lead to a better understanding of organismic structure and function with implications for systems as diverse as forests, food webs, and even tumors. This research project will supply the data needed to directly test existing models and to develop new, more realistic models. Outputs will be new software for extracting vascular data from images (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT)), a large database for vascular measurements in plants and animals, identification of branching patterns common to specific taxa or tissues, and new theory. Measurements will include vessel radii, lengths, branching ratios, and branching angles. Existing models are contradicted by some preliminary results, including asymmetric branching (two daughter vessels of different sizes and different flow) and deviations from self-similarity (similar branching patterns recurring across scales). New models will be constructed to incorporate these findings and used to predict connections between the geometry of and flow through vascular networks. A key prediction of models will be scaling exponents that describe how the number of capillaries changes with network volume. In an attempt to enable quick translation of branching geometry into predictions for flow rate, techniques will be adapted to classify vascular networks according to a suite of these characteristic scaling exponents.<br/><br/>Closely integrated with these research objectives are three educational goals: 1) teach students how to use image recognition software to extract data from images across biological fields, including museum collections and labs, 2) teach students how to translate empirical results into equations and test specific, mechanistic hypotheses, and 3) motivate data sharing with the public and scientific community via websites for large, comprehensive databases that will accelerate scientific research and community outreach. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers will all be trained during this research. Notably, summer research experiences for three high school students will be provided for each year of the project. A critical aspect of this training is in teaching students how to combine theory and empirical data and how to disseminate research findings through publications, websites, curricular materials, and talks at professional meetings as well as outreach. The PI has experience educating and training students at all levels and will actively recruit students from under-represented groups to engage in informatics research. Publications, databases, code, and curricular materials will all be made available through websites. Together, this work will provide an example of how computer vision techniques can be used to extract data from biological images around the world."

Developing and managing successful crop practices is a goal that is fundamentally tied to our national food security. By applying novel computational visual analytical methods, this project seeks to identify and unravel the complex web of interactions linking genotypes, environments and phenotypes. These methods will first need to be designed and developed into usable software applications that can handle large volumes of crop phenomics data. High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.<br/><br/><br/>This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools.

High-throughput sensing technologies collect large volumes of field data for many plant traits, such as flowering time, related to crop development and production. The maize cultivars used here come from multiple genotypes that have been grown under a variety of environmental conditions, in order to give the widest range of conditions for understanding the interactions. The resulting data sets are growing quickly, both in size and complexity, but the analytical tools needed to extract knowledge and catalyze scientific discoveries have significantly lagged behind. The methodologies to be developed in this project represent a systematic attempt at bridging this rapidly widening divide. The project is inherently interdisciplinary, involving close research partnerships among computer scientists, plant scientists, and mathematicians. The research outcomes will be tightly integrated with education using a multipronged approach that includes, among others, postdoctoral and student training (graduates and undergraduates), curriculum development for a new campus-wide interdisciplinary undergraduate degree in Data Analytics, conference tutorials for training phenomics data practitioners, and contribution to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (particularly women) in STEM fields through the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.<br/><br/><br/>This project will lead to the design and development of a new, scalable, visual analytics platform suitable for hypothesis extraction and refinement from complex phenomics data sets. Focus on hypothesis extraction is critical in the context of phenomics data sets because much of the high-throughput sensing data being generated in crop fields are generated in the absence of specifically formulated hypotheses. Extracting plausible hypotheses from the data represents an important but tedious task. To this end, this project will apply and develop new capabilities using emerging advanced algorithmic principles, particularly from the branch of mathematics called algebraic topology that studies shapes and structure of complex data. The research objectives are three-fold. First, the project will employ and extend emerging algorithmic techniques from algebraic topology to decode the structure of large, complex phenomics data. Second, an interactive visual analytic platform will be developed to facilitate knowledge discovery using the extracted topological structures. Lastly, the quality and validity of a new visual analytic platform designed by this team will be tested using real-world maize data sets as well as simulated inputs as testbeds. The developed framework will encode functions for scientists to delineate hypotheses of three kinds: i) genetic characterization of single complex traits; ii) genetic characterization of multiple traits that share potentially pleiotropic effects; and iii) decoding and detailed characterization of genotype-by-environmental interactions, in particular, through a collaborative pilot study of maize flowering and growth traits. The expected significance of the proposed work is that biologists will be able to extract different types of testable hypotheses from plant phenomics data sets by employing a new class of visual analytic tools, and thus obtain a deeper understanding of the interactions among genotypes, environments and phenotypes. The project is potentially transformative in two ways: i) it will introduce advanced mathematical and computational principles into mainstream phenomic data analysis; and ii) it will usher in a new era where biologists spearhead data-driven hypothesis extraction and discovery with the aid of interactive, informative, and intuitive tools. The project will have a direct impact on the state of software in phenomics for fundamental data-driven discovery. To facilitate broader community adoption, the project will integrate the tools into the CyVerse Institute, and to a community phenomics software outlet. It will also lead to the development of automated scientific workflows. Project website: http://tdaphenomics.eecs.wsu.edu/"

As genome sequencing can help characterizing this diversity and has recently become routine, most microbial scientists have been overwhelmed by the amount of available data. For many researchers, a complete and thorough analysis of the available genome data is not necessary. Instead, these users would be better served with straightforward methods that can identify their unknown DNA/RNA sequence(s), and be able to discriminate between well-understood taxa and those that are potentially novel. Tools that can help direct researchers to the most ""interesting"" genomes and genes among thousands of candidates will be important. Furthermore, metagenomics, which is the sequencing of environmental DNA, allows the genetic characterization of the majority of these prokaryotes that have resisted cultivation in the laboratory. However, current tools to analyze metagenomic data are clearly lagging behind the development of sequencing technologies (and data processing tools), and are typically limited to genome assembly and gene annotation. This is a major limitation for better understanding, studying and communicating about the biodiversity of uncultivated microorganisms that run the life-sustaining biogeochemical cycles on the planet, form critical associations with their plant and animal hosts, or produce products of biotechnological value.

Following the successful development of mass spectrometry (MS) technologies, that have enabled the identification and quantification of many thousands of proteins in hundreds of species, the high throughput tandem mass spectrometry approach has become the method of choice for the overwhelming majority of large scale proteomics studies. Data acquisition has proceeding at faster and faster rates, and, combined with the reliability of large scale repositories (e.g., PRIDE, MassIVE, etc) and with journal publication guidelines for quality and annotation, the result has been public availability of hundreds of terabytes of well documented proteomics MS data. The total volume of proteomics data is currently doubling about every 1.5 years. There is tremendous potential for untapped discoveries lying in these 9000+ public datasets. Unfortunately the drive for sharing of raw data has not been accompanied by  corresponding efforts to provide protein identification and abundance data, that are required for initial verification by MS experts and subsequent re-use by scientists who are not MS experts. As it stands today, less than 0.1% of all public non-human proteomics MS data only report identifications at the most minimal standards that show acceptable statistical controls; essentially no datasets report quantitative results. The ProteoCarta platform created through this award will address this problem by i) systematically reanalyzing public datasets using advanced computational mass spectrometry workflows and ii) organizing the results in a structured database so that results will be accessible through intuitive query interfaces.<br/><br/><br/>Building on computational MS platforms that have already processed over 10 billion spectra in 700,000 jobs from thousands of users in 122 countries, this proposal aims to address this community-scale challenge with a new ProteoCarta resource equipped to systematically reprocess proteomics MS big data from hundreds of species and designed to integrate all results into an open knowledge base that indexes repository-scale global proteomics data.  ProteoCarta will significantly scale state of the art algorithms to enable analysis of hundreds of terabytes of data and will extend and integrate new spectral network algorithms for large scale discovery of protein variations within and across samples and species, including MS detection of sequence variants as well as discovery of unexpected or novel post-translational modifications. In addition to releasing all data and analysis results in standard open formats, ProteoCarta results will be directly attached to reanalyzed public datasets, to be stored at MassIVE, whereby hundreds of scientists will be automatically notified of the updates and directly encouraged to actively explore the new results on their own data.

The presence and concentrations of these molecules serve as features when determining a diagnostic pattern for specific states of development or disease. The approach to biomarker identification taken in this research attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (protein levels occurring in the condition). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for the condition. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data sets and therefore low success in such markers becoming important in applications such as diagnostics in clinical practice. We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving fundamental problems with the current approach by using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data, and follow this up with a systematic experimental validation system in model organisms.  The disease model we are using is for Alzheimer's disease (AD), an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD, and their building blocks are Amyloid-alpha and tau proteins, respectively. These proteins can be measured accurately from human brain tissues, as can global gene expression values. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles, or any protective or pathological responses to these toxic peptides.  <br/><br/>Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data indicate three fundamental problems with this approach. <br/>First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. <br/>To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data by 1) selecting interpretable features, 2) making interpretable predictions, and 3) validating and refining predictions through interventional experiments. This approach has the following aims:<br/>1. Develop NEBULA (network-based unsupervised feature learning) framework to learn interpretable features that will likely provide meaningful phenotype explanations from publicly available multi-omic data sets. <br/>2. Develop a unified framework, called SHAP (Shapley additive explanation), to interpret the predictions of complex models by estimating the importance of each feature to a particular prediction.<br/>3. Validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments using high-throughput assays of gene knockdown on powerful nematode models of proteotoxicity.    <br/>For further information see the project website at: http://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/projects/im3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ideally new experiments include some replication, fill in gaps and produce new knowledge, but this balance is hard to achieve when existing data sets are in different locations or organized in very different ways.  Thus to achieve the goal, two aims are proposed: 1) develop methods for creating cohesive biological datasets from public experiments such that they are suitable for training computational models; 2) develop methods that indicate what experimental conditions should be used to collect new datasets so that are the most likely to yield important information about the study organism's biological properties, like structure and behavior. Achieving this goal will enable an understanding of important rules of life for organisms more efficiently and economically, by focusing on the experiments that give us the most value for the funds spent.<br/><br/>This exploratory project will focus on data arising from genome-wide transcriptional profiling methods (e.g. microarrays, RNA-Seq), building a computational foundation for later expansion. First, optimal data processing techniques for creating integrated compendia will be assessed, in order to select the best method for building training datasets for machine learning methods. Second, data-driven computational models will be trained on the data compendia and evaluated for success in describing and microbial behavior. Third, given the normalized compendia (in the transcriptomics data space) an optimal experimental design methodology will be prototyped, to recommend the best set of experiments to perform to yield the complete set of data needed to fit and test the biological model. The experimental design methodology will be benchmarked using synthetic data, and then evaluated by exploring the effect of design- recommended combinations of antibiotics and antiseptics (10 in all) on microbial behavior. This will be compared to the outcomes of experiments designed by methods currently used. Success metrics will focus on how quickly the required information in the experimental space is gathered and what level of uncertainty in a model remains after each experiment is completed."

Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. <br/><br/>The specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org."

Metabolomics is the study of the chemical signatures of the small molecules, like sugars, that are the products of biological processes. Metabolite fingerprints reveal a great deal about the recent activities occurring in biological samples. Knowing how organisms respond to their surroundings gives important leads to understanding events in fields like plant biology and agriculture, environmental and water quality studies, and human health research into nutrition or diseases. The chemical fingerprints are generated using two different technologies, called nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The results can be very complex and difficult to merge. This means the challenges for data analysis are also high, and include requirements to develop new approaches, like multivariate statistical methods. This proposal aims to produce software tools that will extract the most possible information from the data, including data format conversion, preprocessing, validation, significance testing, visualization, and metabolite identification at defined levels of confidence. The MVAPACK toolkit will enable important, currently unavailable data processing functions in the form of freely available and open source software modules, with an impact on data quality, sharing, information content resulting in deeper biological insights from studies that include metabolite profiling.  <br/><br/><br/> <br/> During the award period, this research project will further enhance the MVAPACK metabolomics toolkit by including additional and urgently needed capabilities. Such improvements will include adding features to load and process liquid chromatography (LC)-MS, gas chromatography(GC)-MS and multidimensional datasets; to expand capabilities to integrate multiple datasets for chemometrics; and to automate metabolite identification, which is one of the more challenging and time-consuming aspects of metabolomics. This work will employ, among other approaches, graph theory, covariance NMR, back-scaled pseudospectral loadings, and a combined NMR and MS approach to facilitate the accurate and rapid assignment of metabolites from complex biological samples. Overall, these efforts will lead to an improved MVAPACK software package (http://bionmr.unl.edu/mvapack.php) for the metabolomics scientific community that will enhance the information content, utility, and ease of processing and combining various types of NMR and MS datasets."

Housing more than 500,000 specimens, the combined collections at A-State represent an important record of regional biodiversity from the Interior Highlands, Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and Crowley's Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States. These collections are threatened by overcrowding, resulting in inefficient and limited use, and specimen degradation in some cases. This project unifies the eight collections at A-State into common spaces with new shelving, cabinetry, and a singular database under the newly formed Arkansas Center for Biodiversity Collections (ACBC). Improved access to the ACBC will increase opportunities to engage students in understanding the importance and utility of natural history collections, as well as enhance research opportunities for A-State students and the broader scientific community. Additionally, students of the A-State Natural History Collections Curation Club (NHC3) will work with curators to develop natural history displays and K-12 class field trip tours including biodiversity and specimen workshops to educate the underserved student populations in the region. Through active undergraduate and graduate student involvement, the ACBC will link research-grade natural history collections to the general public, particularly K-12 students.<br/><br/>The ACBC mission is to provide a unified, accessible specimen repository and research center for the State of Arkansas, including the Interior Highlands, Upper Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and Crowley's Ridge ecoregions. This geographical region is a major center of endemism for numerous taxonomic groups in eastern North America, and one that has seen drastic landscape modifications over the past 100 years. A large proportion of the collections at A-State cover these unique and diverse ecosystems and represent long-term records that pre-date or document biota during habitat transforming activities or disease spread (e.g., white-nose syndrome in bats) in the region. These collections, therefore, serve as base-line data points for ongoing and future changing conditions. Additionally, this project will preserve and curate voucher specimens and make available important data to the scientific community for small- and large-scale research (e.g., ecological, taxonomic, biogeographic, or applied global change research). Specific project goals are to: 1) alleviate overcrowding and increase room for growth through installation of high-density storage systems and new cabinetry; 2) secure collections through improved storage media and labeling; 3) complete the digitization of specimen data and provide public access to all collection data; and 4) develop a significant outreach program by providing collections-based workshops and tours of ACBC displays and collections. Development of a website for the ACBC (acbc.astate.edu) will highlight collection activities and the current Specify web portal (specify.astate.edu) will be expanded to include ASUMZ specimen data in addition to updated herbarium specimen data. Finally, the complete ACBC database will be interfaced with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and other publicly accessible data portals (i.e., VertNet, SERNEC, and GBIF)."

The late Cretaceous was a time of warmer, ""greenhouse"" climates and higher sea levels than those of today, and environments may have been similar to those predicted for the middle of the next century under some scenarios of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.  The data made available through this TCN offer an opportunity to answer a variety of questions dealing with the impact of climatic and sea level change on marine communities, and may provide critical information for predicting future outcomes for modern marine biodiversity. This project will digitize collection data from the SNM and make them accessible to the scientific community, industry, K-16 educators and students, and the public via a variety of web portals.  Additional societal impacts of the project are made through a collaboration with the Education Department at the SNM, which will develop a field- and lab-based teacher workshop and web resources, and produce curricula that focus on biotic and environmental change over time, including sea level change, continental drift and other geological phenomena.  The project also contributes to training of university students in modern digitization techniques and the generation of biodiversity data from museum collections, with up to five students participating annually.<br/><br/>The Invertebrate Paleontology Collection at the SNM will digitize data for about 13,000 specimens from 450 localities at the northern and southern ends of the seaway, and thereby expand both the paleogeographic and paleoenvironmental reach of the project.  Of particular importance are localities from the far northern margin of the seaway in Alaska and northwestern Canada that extend geographic coverage of the project by at least 4,000 km.  They will allow the geographic ranges of species to be assessed fully, and will also provide insight into latitudinal variability in paleocommunity composition. The SNM?s holdings also include about 7,500 specimens from 240 localities in southern Oklahoma.  They record paleocommunities in coastal regions of the seaway that lie shoreward of localities in Texas that will be contributed by other partners in the project. These data ""fill in"" the more proximal end of a shallow marine environmental gradient near the southern margin of the seaway, thereby expanding the scope of the project into onshore environments.  Data will be aggregated by the TCN and shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org)."

This collection of over 450,000 specimens of freshwater fishes from throughout the State, provides an unparalleled record of the occurrence, distribution, and ecology of these species in the Tennessee and Mobile River basins, will be transferred to the University of Alabama Ichthyological Collection (UAIC).  The transfer will secure the collection at UAIC and ensure the long-term care of these valuable specimens, as well as providing increased access to the specimens and associated ecological data through the UAIC web portal (specifyweb.as.ua.edu) and those of project partners (GBIF, FishNet2, VertNet, and iDigBio).  The intensive sampling effort that resulted in the GSA collection makes it of particular importance to the research community including its use in student training and research. <br/><br/>This project transfers ownership of the GSA fish collection into UAIC, providing immediate curatorial intervention to a very large collection of freshwater fishes and associated ecological data that would otherwise be lost to the scientific community.  Addition of these specimens into UAIC augments and supplements the material currently in UAIC in both the number of specimens and the value of the associated collection and ecological data to the research community.  The GSA collection represents intensive sampling throughout Alabama and surrounding drainages and potentially informs systematics, biogeography, taxonomy, life-history, and ecological studies.  The environmental data associated with a large portion of the specimens provide time-series information usable by conservation biologists, ecologists and land managers to document human impacts and environmental changes across freshwater aquatic ecosystems in Alabama.  The GSA collection also greatly increases UAIC's holdings of threatened and endangered species endemic to Alabama, and facilitates future research on these taxa by providing electronic access to these valuable specimens.  By uniting these collections and providing access to associated field data through several biodiversity information portals an invaluable resource documenting freshwater fish biodiversity in Alabama and the southeastern United States is made available for training and research."

The accurate annotation of protein function is key to understanding life, but experimentally determining what each protein does is costly and difficult, and cannot scale up to accommodate the vast amount of sequence data already available. Therefore discovering protein protein function by computational, rather than experimental means, is of primary importance. Genomic sequence data are available from thousands of species,  and those are coupled with massive high-throughput experimental data. Together, these data have created new opportunities as well as challenges for computational function prediction. As a result, many computational annotation methods have been developed by research groups worldwide, but their accuracy and applicability need to be improved upon. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG) is to bring together computational biologists, experimental biologists and biocurators who are dealing with the important problem of predicting protein function, to share ideas, and create collaborations. To improve computational function prediction methods, the Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) was established as an ongoing experiment. CAFA was designed to provide a large-scale assessment of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function. By challenging dozens of research groups worldwide to develop and provide their best software for function prediction, the researchers involved in the AFP-SIG will improve the ability of biologists to understand life at the molecular level. The AFP-SIG researchers will also generate experimental data from fruit-flies, fungi and bacteria to be used as benchmarks to test the software participating in CAFA, and a deeper understanding of these model organisms. <br/><br/>It is now possible to collect data that comprehensively profile many different states of complex biological systems. Using these data it should be possible to understand and explain the underlying systems, but significant challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is that, as researchers collect more data from many different organisms in many different systems, they discover more and different genes. Assigning functions to these newly discovered genes represents a key step towards interpretation of high-throughput data. This leads to a critical need to assess the quality of the function prediction methods that researchers have developed in recent years. The mission of the Automated Function Prediction Special Interest Group (AFP-SIG), founded in 2005, is to bring together bioinformaticians and biologists who are addressing this key challenge of gene function prediction. In addition to sharing ideas and creating collaboration, AFP-SIG has created CAFA: the Critical Assessment of (protein) Function Annotation. CAFA is a community-driven challenge to assess the performance of protein function prediction software, and it has been carried out twice since 2010.  The investigators will provide the following outcomes: (1) robust open-source software to be used in function prediction and assessment of function prediction methods, incorporated into the high-profile annotation pipelines of UniProt-GOA; (2) expansion of the AFP community by engaging bioinformaticians, biocurators and experimentalists, thereby improving the quality and relevance of function prediction methods; (3) large-scale experimental screens in Drosophila, Candida and Pseudomonas for novel associations of targeted functional terms with genes; (4) an expanded CAFA event, incorporating both the curated annotations from the literature and our own experimental screens, in the last two years of the project.

These systems also sustain biodiversity and provide support for basic ecological processes as well as important economic and recreational activities. Nevertheless, freshwater systems are heavily impacted by human actions that are having significant detrimental effects on water quality, increasing water temperatures, altering seasonal river and stream flows, and subsequently impacting freshwater biodiversity. Projected changes in air temperature and precipitation in the coming century are expected to further impact water resources and the biodiversity dependent on these systems, yet basic data describing variation in streamflow and water temperature across North America are not available. This project will address this issue by generating the ""HydroClim"" dataset, which will provide monthly streamflow and water temperature predictions for stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada from 1950-2099. This work will produce the first dataset on freshwater resources in North America of this scope and resolution. These data will provide a vast array of benefits to the public in terms of greater understanding of water resources in the coming century as well as numerous training opportunities directed at developing a large and interactive group of scientists focusing on the conservation of water resources and freshwater biodiversity in the United States and Canada. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and distribute ""HydroClim"", a data set characterizing contemporary and future streamflows and water temperatures in individual stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada. These data will be generated on high-performance computing systems using multiple Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic models linked with a water temperature model. The SWAT hydrologic and water temperature models will be generated using contemporary air temperature and precipitation data as well as future climate data from multiple Global Climate Model scenarios to produce monthly estimates of streamflow volume and water temperature for the years 1950-2099. These data will also be integrated with FishNet 2 (www.fishnet2.net), an established data portal that provides scientists, government agencies, resource managers, and the general public free and open access to occurrences of over 4.1 million species lots of freshwater fishes, globally, and over 2 million lots for the United States and Canada, thus allowing for the characterization of the habitat requirements of freshwater species in this region. Results from these efforts will also allow for examination of the sensitivity of streams throughout the United States and Canada to changes in climate, thus providing a greater understanding of the factors regulating water resources as well as the distribution of freshwater biodiversity both now and in the coming century. The HydroClim data and results of this project will be available online at www.hydroclim.org."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

Historically, increasingly powerful X-ray sources led to great leaps in the ability to obtain information about structures of biomolecules, which is critically related to the molecules' biological function. The first X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) came online in 2009 at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, granting researchers the unprecedented ability to see the detailed atomic arrangements in, and movements of, biological molecules in their natural state (i.e. warm and wet). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), a novel extension of crystallography making use of the extreme flux and ultra-short duration of XFEL pulses, has produced new insights into fundamentally important processes such as photosynthesis, helping to understand how plants and bacteria convert sunlight into energy and create the oxygen we breathe, making life possible on earth, as well as improving human health by aiding pharmaceutical drug design, for example guiding improvements in pain killers and blood pressure regulators. However, XFEL experiments with biological targets typically require very large volumes of data and thus a correspondingly large volume of scarce, precious protein, to obtain high-resolution molecular structures. Furthermore, XFEL facilities typically host only one or two experiments simultaneously, and only two XFELs presently serve the global user community, while more will be coming online in 2017. The number of biological targets that can be studied and the rate of discoveries can be dramatically increased through the development of innovative, advanced algorithms that reduce the number of necessary measurements and extract more information from the samples by fully exploiting the information content that is unique to XFEL diffraction, and by extending XFEL use to uncrystallized targets. <br/><br/>This project has three main objectives: (a) explore algorithms for improving data accuracy in XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography through modeling and optimization (beyond the Monte Carlo approach for data merging), (b) explore and develop novel phasing methods which exploit the full spatial coherence of the XFEL for 2D and 3D nanocrystals, and (c) develop structure-determination methods that can be applied to samples that cannot be crystallized, through XFEL fast solution scattering (FSS). FSS can provide dynamic structural information from ""snapshot"" diffraction from particles that can be studied dynamically in solution, broadening the range of samples suitable for XFELs. Further development of this approach to include statistical intensity correlations that are unique to XFEL measurements can potentially displace the need for crystal growth altogether. These new algorithms, which will be freely available to the scientific community, will increase accessibility and applicability of the revolutionary capabilities of XFELs for biological imaging by significantly decreasing the amount of sample, data and experimental time (and therefore overall costs) necessary to obtain high-resolution structures. Thus the project will contribute directly to improved understanding of the fundamental biomolecular mechanisms by providing time-resolved images of molecular machines at work.

While the advent of MPS methods has allowed microbial ecologists to ask meaningful questions with ever-greater precision, it brings significant challenges to individual small laboratories struggling to manage megabytes or even gigabytes of data. This project will sustain the web service VAMPS (Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures, http://vamps.mbl.edu), which removes the need for individual research groups to make the considerable investment in computational infrastructure and bioinformatic support otherwise necessary to process, analyze, and interpret MPS data for microbial ecology. VAMPS is a free, open-source database-driven website that allows researchers using MPS data to analyze the diversity of microbial communities and the relationships between communities, to explore these analyses in an intuitive visual context, and to download analyses and images for publication. Any web-capable device can be used to upload, process, explore, and extract data and results from VAMPS, and the VAMPS development team is available to assist in all aspects of data processing and analysis. VAMPS encourages researchers to share sequence and metadata, and fosters collaboration between researchers of disparate biomes who recognize common patterns in shared data. VAMPS currently hosts more than 200 projects encompassing more than 5000 datasets and over 250 million sequence tags, is used by nearly 1000 investigators from around the world, and has supported at least 15 NSF-funded projects. VAMPS provides unique educational opportunities through its combination of data from a variety of environments, its integration of sequence cluster-based and taxonomy-based analytical and visualization tools, and the instruction provided by project developers.<br/><br/>VAMPS is designed for visualization, exploration, and analysis of amplicon tag data in a comparative context. Sequence data and associated metadata can be uploaded directly by users or by sending data to the VAMPS project team; MPS reads can be automatically quality filtered and assigned to both taxonomic structures and to taxonomic-independent clusters. These can then be linked to metadata and compared using a wide variety of analytical and visualization tools. Each result is extensively hyperlinked to other analysis and visualization options, promoting data exploration and leading to a greater understanding of data relationships. A major strength of VAMPS is that researchers can compare not only datasets within their own projects but can compare these with datasets from projects such as NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research projects, the International Census of Marine Microbes, the Human Microbiome Project, and hundreds of other individual projects. The project will support: 1) Active releases of QIIME, OTU clustering methods, oligotyping, and other methods as authors release new versions. 2) A VAMPS administrator to support users in uploading and trimming data and the use of the many VAMPS visualization and analysis tools, exporting data for other analytical methods and images for publication, and facilitating collaborations and adding new portals. 3) Incorporation of new publicly available data. Projects of particular interest include the Earth Microbiome Project, the American Gut Project, and Terra Oceans that have or will have data that would benefit the research community if made available through VAMPS. 4) Adapting analysis capabilities to other appropriate genes as requested by the community. 5) Hardware and software maintenance and data storage.

Established in 1988 and operated by the University of New Mexico's Sevilleta Field Station (SevFS; http://sevfs.unm.edu/), SevMET is a spatially-distributed network of meteorological stations that spans multiple dryland ecosystems representative of the southwestern US. Climate governs many aspects of dryland ecosystems. Thus, a network of spatially representative, high resolution, comprehensive meteorological stations is essential to supporting drylands research. SevFS provides logistical support to a variety of researchers and educators, ranging from K-12 students and teachers to undergraduate and graduate students to senior scientists from around the world. Improvements to SevMET will promote understanding of dryland ecosystems by providing important supporting data needed for research projects conducted in the SevNWR, such as the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research program. All data will be made freely available via the SevFS website, as well as through the New Mexico Climate Center and MesoWest, both of which provide climate and weather data to the general public. <br/><br/>Dryland ecosystems occupy ~45% of the terrestrial land surface and account for ~40% of global net primary production. Ecosystem processes in drylands are strongly regulated by climatic drivers that are highly variable in space and time, both within and among years. Therefore, accurate measurement of weather and climate is fundamental to understanding how dryland ecosystems respond to seasonal and annual changes in rainfall and temperature. The enhanced and expanded SevMET will consist of fifteen comprehensive weather stations distributed across the SevNWR. These data will serve as important variables for long-term observational and experimental studies to help explain how and why dryland ecosystems differ in space and change over time. Ongoing and new research in the SevNWR will be significantly improved by these enhancements that will more accurately quantify climate variability in these ecologically important dryland ecosystems. These improvements will also strengthen existing training and educational opportunities supported by SevFS, including the Sevilleta Research Experience for Undergraduates Program, which has a strong record of training minority undergraduate students. Also, enhancing research infrastructure will benefit the Methods in Environmental Data Acquisition summer course, which attracts an international cohort of technicians, students, post-doctoral fellows, and early career faculty, through a unique field-based training opportunity in the design, deployment, and maintenance of environmental sensor networks. Finally, weather data generated by these meteorological stations will also be used to develop classroom exercises for K-12 students and teachers associated with the Schoolyard Long-term Ecological Research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An understanding of animal movement can inform a wide range of biological topics including population and community ecology, animal physiology, disease spread, gene flow, and wildlife management and conservation. Historically, a lack of movement data limited progress, but advances in tracking technology have facilitated the collection of high-quality movement data for an ever-growing number of species. Now, the key bottleneck is the dearth of good statistical tools for extracting information from these accumulating data sources. This research addresses this gap by combining movement-modeling techniques from physics with statistical methods for non-independent data from geostatistics. These next-generation analytical tools will allow biologists to tackle the four key analysis categories in movement ecology: 1) modeling movement paths, 2) estimating kinematic quantities such as velocity and distance travelled, 3) identifying driving relationships between resources and movement, and 4) quantifying animal space use. Outreach efforts will target the diverse array of biologists collecting and asking questions of animal movement data. Specifically, a series of tutorial papers will demonstrate methods covering the four analysis categories on conservation-focused case studies including African bush elephants in Kenya and the endangered khulan in the Mongolian Gobi desert. Additionally, an in-depth training course aimed at conservation practitioners and wildlife managers will be offered, and project results will be incorporated into the graduate and undergraduate curriculum at University of Maryland.<br/><br/>This work combines recent advances in modeling movement as a continuous space, continuous time stochastic process with kriging techniques from geostatistics. Kriging is a statistically optimal method of probabilistically ""filling in the blanks"" between a limited number of autocorrelated data points. Kriging revolutionized geostatistics and is now the gold standard for interpolating between autocorrelated spatial point observations. Analogously, adapting kriging to movement data will allow researchers to probabilistically reconstruct movement paths from a limited number of location observations. Knowledge of the continuous path an animal traversed is the critical nexus linking animal movement data to a wide range of ecologically-informative and conservation-relevant analyses. These transformative methods therefore have the potential to remove the key roadblock that is currently holding movement ecology back. To fully capitalize on that potential, this project will develop an integrated suite of freely available software packages for the R environment for statistical computing. These packages will enable users to answer movement related questions for a broad range of species with the powerful krige-based analytical tools the project develops. Project results will be available at http://biology.umd.edu/movement.html."

First, the deluge of genomic data needs to undergo deep analysis to mine biological information, which requires a full pipeline that integrates many data processing and analysis tools. Second, deep analysis pipelines often take long to run, which entails a long cycle for algorithm and method development. This project aims to bring the latest big data technology and database technology to the genomics domain to revolutionize its data crunching power. This project is anticipated to produce significant scientific and educational benefits. By providing a highly-optimized parallel processing platform for genomic data analysis and making it accessible in private and public clouds, it will enable many new models and algorithms to be developed for genomics and help advance this field at unprecedented speed as big data technology did for Internet companies. This project also integrates research and education with curriculum development, tutorials for K-12 teachers and community college faculty, and engaging women in research through college outreach and NSF-funded outreach programs.<br/><br/>The proposed research includes the development of (1) a deep pipeline for genomic data analysis by assembling state-of-the-art methods, (2) automatic parallelization of the workflow using the big data technology, (3) a principled approach to optimizing the genomic pipeline, and (4) integration of streaming technology to reduce latency of important results. The prototype system will be deployed in both private and public cloud environments, and fully evaluated using existing long-running pipelines at the New York Genome Center and in a variety of real use cases. By way of doing so, this project will provide new knowledge regarding how to adapt and advance big data technology, including new optimization, partitioning, and scheduling techniques, for the genomics domain.

However, the monitoring equipment at this station is outdated and obsolete. This project will provide critical equipment upgrades to the stream monitoring network, which will improve both the quality and the accessibility of the streamflow and water quality information collected by this network. This project will also upgrade the existing Robinson Forest weather station and add another weather station, which will improve the quality and accessibility of weather data collected from this important facility. Better data quality will allow researchers to perform more sensitive and powerful analysis regarding manmade (mining, logging) and natural (insects, fire) impacts on freshwater resources. Understanding these and other water quality issues is essential for the protection and improvement of stream health, especially in Appalachia. In addition, better data accessibility will make this valuable information available for use by other researchers, state and federal agencies tasked with water resource conservation and management and the general public. Over time, this project will help reduce stream degradation and lead to the continued development of improved watershed management guidelines, improving stream health in Appalachia and beyond. <br/><br/>This project will upgrade the existing stream monitoring network at Robinson Forest to enhance both data quality and data accessibility. Currently, the monitoring equipment is old and technologically obsolete, and requires a significant amount of upkeep time for data collection and processing. This project will allow researchers to live-stream streamflow data online, dramatically improving data accessibility for PIs and other investigators. The project will also add conductivity and temperature sensing capability to the network. Currently, these and other water quality parameters are collected on only a weekly basis, which is relatively insensitive from a water quality monitoring perspective. This project will allow collection of conductivity and temperature data at 15-minute intervals, and will also allow live-streaming of these data online. These upgrades will improve the quality and accessibility of these data, improving utilization by both PIs at the University of Kentucky and visiting and collaborating scholars and scientists from other institutions and agencies. In addition to upgrading the stream monitoring network, the project will upgrade the existing Robinson Forest weather station and add an additional weather station. These stations will live-stream weather data online via the Kentucky Mesonet platform, enhancing data availability for both UK investigators and collaborators. These improvements will significantly enhance the ability of existing  investigators and potential new partners to investigate important projects including understanding impacts of surface mining on Appalachian streamflow and water quality (and associated aquatic and riparian wildlife), developing forest management guidelines for minimal stream impacts, and understanding reference quality streamflow and water quality in Appalachia. Finally, these upgrades will make these data accessible in real-time for students in relevant courses at the University of Kentucky and collaborating institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, truly quantitative characterization and comparison of complex morphological features still cannot be adequately addressed by existing methods, which are typically developed only for idealized 2D images or surfaces. The accurate and efficient characterization and comparison of shapes with 3D noisy imaging data represents highly non-trivial computational problems which have yet to be adequately addressed in comparative morphology studies, nor has efficient computational software been made available to the researchers. The goal of this project is to develop advanced computational methods for accurate quantitative characterization and comparison of specimen morphology from high resolution 3D voxel-based digital imaging modalities. With the growing recognition of the importance of digital libraries of biological specimens derived from advanced imaging methods, such as the NSF funded Digital Fish Library (DFL) and Digital Morphology (DigiMorph) projects, advanced methods for utilizing these data are of great importance, but pose significant technical challenges. Two broad classes of problems are of critical importance: 1) The ability to quantitatively characterize complicated morphological features from high resolution volumetric data and 2) Methods for comparing such features between specimens. Our objective is to develop two specific computational methods for geometric morphological analysis that can optimally characterize and compare geometric features embedded within real 3D imaging data, and are robust to noise and resolution limitations: 1) A novel shape analysis method based on signatures derived from spherical wave decomposition of 3D images; 2) A robust non-linear spatial normalization method based on diffeomorphic image and landmark registration. The spatial normalization methods will allow homologous structures to be correctly non-linearly warped to each other or a common template for comparison, while the decomposition method will facilitate robust, efficient, accurate, and automated characterization of shapes embedded within complex 3D datasets. These methods can then be used to generate species-specific atlases that define normative morphologies, thus facilitating both inter- and intra-specific comparative analyses. These methods will then be applied to the general problem of automated shape segmentation, then tested on two problems of significant biological importance: 1) Co-evolution of the short-tailed opossum inner ear and cranium and 2) Three-spine stickleback evolution from freshwater to saltwater species.<br/><br/>Characterization and comparison of morphological (form, shape, or structure) variations is a problem of significant impact across a wide range of biological disciplines. The rise of 3D volumetric imaging methods for digitizing biological samples offers great possibilities for addressing these issues but requires a theoretical and computational framework capable of allowing researchers efficient and accurate methods for analyzing complicated biological structures embedded within 3D volumetric noisy digital data. The goal of this project is to develop computational tools to address the two primary issues at the heart of these analyses: The ability to accurately and efficiently 1) characterize complex morphological features and 2) compare morphological features between specimens. The ability to perform these is critical to facilitating the use of all digital library data for quantitative morphology but to date have not been developed. The goal of this proposal is to develop analysis software to fill this significant<br/>gap in the bridge between digital imaging methods and its ultimate potential for transforming the field of comparative morphology by developing computational methods to address a broad range of morphological questions that inform our knowledge of the evolution and diversification of species. The methods developed by this project will greatly extend the capabilities of researchers and students to incorporate quantitative anatomical measurements into the study of evolutionary biology. The methods are general and applicable to any 3D imaging modality and thus will be of utility to any digital library and will serve as a platform on which new technologies and methodologies can be applied in the future. The resulting analysis tools will be open source and disseminated to researchers through the DFL website (http://www.digitalfishlibrary.org). A corresponding public education exhibit will be developed at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (http://www.cabrillomarineaquarium.org/). Developing a general computational platform for the computational morphology from 3D digital data will allow evolutionary biologists to quantitatively and reproducibly address problems that provide greater insight into how ecological parameters might be, quite literally, 'shaping' biodiversity and thus has potentially profound implications for the field of evolutionary biology."

These systems also sustain biodiversity and provide support for basic ecological processes as well as important economic and recreational activities. Nevertheless, freshwater systems are heavily impacted by human actions that are having significant detrimental effects on water quality, increasing water temperatures, altering seasonal river and stream flows, and subsequently impacting freshwater biodiversity. Projected changes in air temperature and precipitation in the coming century are expected to further impact water resources and the biodiversity dependent on these systems, yet basic data describing variation in streamflow and water temperature across North America are not available. This project will address this issue by generating the ""HydroClim"" dataset, which will provide monthly streamflow and water temperature predictions for stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada from 1950-2099. This work will produce the first dataset on freshwater resources in North America of this scope and resolution. These data will provide a vast array of benefits to the public in terms of greater understanding of water resources in the coming century as well as numerous training opportunities directed at developing a large and interactive group of scientists focusing on the conservation of water resources and freshwater biodiversity in the United States and Canada. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and distribute ""HydroClim"", a data set characterizing contemporary and future streamflows and water temperatures in individual stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada. These data will be generated on high-performance computing systems using multiple Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic models linked with a water temperature model. The SWAT hydrologic and water temperature models will be generated using contemporary air temperature and precipitation data as well as future climate data from multiple Global Climate Model scenarios to produce monthly estimates of streamflow volume and water temperature for the years 1950-2099. These data will also be integrated with FishNet 2 (www.fishnet2.net), an established data portal that provides scientists, government agencies, resource managers, and the general public free and open access to occurrences of over 4.1 million species lots of freshwater fishes, globally, and over 2 million lots for the United States and Canada, thus allowing for the characterization of the habitat requirements of freshwater species in this region. Results from these efforts will also allow for examination of the sensitivity of streams throughout the United States and Canada to changes in climate, thus providing a greater understanding of the factors regulating water resources as well as the distribution of freshwater biodiversity both now and in the coming century.

From upper reaches of the high peaks of Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, and surrounding states, the headwaters of numerous major rivers of the West originate and give rise to the highest outflow and freshwater runoff west of the Mississippi River:  The Platte, Arkansas, Rio Grande, Colorado, and Green Rivers and portions of the Snake and Missouri Rivers. The cleanliness and reliability of these water resources are in large part attributable to the plant life that forms the basis for all SoRo ecosystems.  Plant species from the high peaks and adjacent high plains of the SoRo derive from different geographic origins, evolutionary histories, and ecological affinities. They grow in varied habitats and represent one of the most narrowly adapted floras in the world.  This unique and fragile flora is widely documented in natural history collections (i.e., herbaria), but specimens themselves and the scientific data that accompany them remain poorly 'visible' owing to a lack of data in digitized format.  The SoRo Herbarium Consortium brings together 38 collaborating institutions (universities, botanical gardens, national parks, Native American Nations) to digitize more than 1.7 million botanical specimens from the study area.  The overarching goal of this project is to make these data available to a broad community of users (scientists, educators, government officials, land managers, the general public) via openly accessible, free data portals.  <br/><br/>The Southern Rocky Mountains (SoRo) support a diverse and highly adapted flora of species with varied ecologies, ranging from alpine to sagebrush plains to shortgrass prairies. The plant biota of the SoRo shares important evolutionary and geological histories with the adjacent plains and prairies, and together these ecosystems are among the most endangered landscapes in North America.  Human demands on these systems are escalating, and risk factors such as fire, development, and environmental change are predicted to grow. Thus, building digital resources to document plant niches in the SoRo is met with a sense of urgency. The proposed work will address a major gap in accessible information among North American natural history collections by digitizing more than 1.7 million botanical collections from the SoRo. Specifically, 38 collaborative institutions (universities, botanical gardens, national parks, Native American Nations) will collaborate to generate these new resources and make them available via data portals, including iDigBio (www.idigbio.org). Additionally, new tools will be developed within the open source Symbiota platform that will allow users to quickly search and compile vetted, herbarium data records that can then be used for analysis in external software applications such as niche modeling packages, or to update source data repositories for subsequent in-house curation."

When there is an imbalance within a community, this can lead to severe effects, such as disease in the human gut or the inability for plants to grow efficiently in soil. An understanding of the composition and interplay within the communities allows us to potentially manipulate them. Metagenomics is the study of these different micro-organism communities, which is achieved by isolating the DNA from the organisms within an environmental sample (e.g. water, soil, animal stool), sequencing the DNA, followed by the computational analysis to decode which organisms are present and the functions they might be performing. This computation is complicated: 1) there is a huge amount of data; 2) The sequence data is a jumbled mix of fragments from different organisms; 3) Decoding the DNA is hard - typically >90% of organisms within a sample are not well characterized. This proposal brings together three major resources within the field of metagenomics data archiving and analysis. The most immediate beneficiaries of the outputs from this proposal and associated resources will be the scientists worldwide who are involved in metagenomics research. This diverse, extensive and expanding community includes (but is not limited to) microbiologists interested in understanding microbial community structure and interactions, biochemists aiming to discover new proteins with functional applications, and clinicians seeking to investigate and modulate the microbial communities associated with healthy or diseased states. <br/><br/>The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a repository of DNA sequence data. Importantly, ENA also captures metagenomic contextual data, such as where and when the sample was taken, how the DNA was extracted and sequenced. The EBI metagenomics portal (EMG,UK) and MG-RAST (MGR,US) are 2 metagenomics sequence analysis platforms. The aim of this project is to initiate a long-term collaboration between the EMG and MGR platforms to build and operate a comprehensive data exchange system, the Metagenomics Exchange (ME). This resource will ensure that metagenomic sequence reads, derived data and associated metadata are permanently preserved and made available for the broadest future use. Crucially, it will ensure that these scientists can discover and mine pre-processed datasets and compare their analysis across varying platforms. There will no longer be the time consuming need for exhaustive searching of ENA, MG-RAST (MGR) and EBI metagenomics (EMG) to discover data, nor will there be the need to submit to both MGR and EMG-the cross submission will simply happen automatically. Furthermore, as a result of the work to make MG-RAST and EMG?s pipelines interoperable, scientists will have access to enhanced analyses that utilize a common set of parameters and allow mixing and matching of pipeline components to suit the data that is being processed, improving and enriching their analysis results. This will also reduce differences that are caused by non-biological artifacts, enabling greater clarity of results. Through the unification of result interfaces, standard users and power users will benefit, with MGR and EMG results accessible via each other's websites, helping the former set of user, and the ability to mine across multiple datasets offered for the latter user set."

Highly trained postdoc scientists are employed to manually convert them. By one estimate, one year's worth of English biomedical journal publications alone would take a full-time postdoc over 30 years to convert. This manual process is fundamentally problematics for three reasons: First, it does not stop the continued publication of character descriptions in the legacy format. Second, it takes time away from highly trained scientists and preventing them from making new and more important discoveries. Third, it does not address the fundamental causes of large differences (~ 40%)  in the data converted by different scientists, resulting in less useful data. This project will investigate a transformative approach that solves the problem at its root, by enabling authors of biodiversity works to directly produce computable data at the time of publication, eliminating the need for subsequent post-publication data conversion. Scientists will be able to direct use the published data in the new format to address grand conservation, environmental, or medical challenges facing humankind today.    <br/><br/>This research has great potential to solve the phenotype data production problem at its root. It recognizes that authors make (implicit) ontological commitments when writing a descriptive work and that they are best qualified to interpret the work. Instead of limiting authors to any ""standardized"" terminology, authors will be provided with a low-barrier, efficient, open-collaboration platform to describe characters as accurately as they wish using an ontology built collectively with other authors working on similar taxa. This process makes authors more aware of term usage in the community and helps the community (including younger generation of scientists) converge on best practices. The result will be that all character terms included in the descriptive work are documented/defined in the taxon-specific ontology and the descriptions are consequently made semantically clear, and ready for software to harvest computable character data. The software platform to be developed by this project exposes disagreements among authors and usage-based term status in the ontology, and notifies authors of updates and conflicts via a mobile-friendly app. Taking into account user motivation and attribution factors, the project will design, implement, and evaluate the approach from both human social behavior and software usability perspectives, employing recent results from open online collaboration research and cutting-edge usability test techniques (e.g., measuring user stress levels via eye-tracking and pupil dilation). The success of the project is generalizable to other domains and will fundamentally change the way phenotypic characters are documented and used in biological research.

This project will address this issue by generating the ""HydroClim"" dataset, which will provide monthly streamflow and water temperature predictions for stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada from 1950-2099. This work will produce the first dataset on freshwater resources in North America of this scope and resolution. These data will provide a vast array of benefits to the public in terms of greater understanding of water resources in the coming century as well as numerous training opportunities directed at developing a large and interactive group of scientists focusing on the conservation of water resources and freshwater biodiversity in the United States and Canada. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and distribute ""HydroClim"", a data set characterizing contemporary and future streamflows and water temperatures in individual stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada. These data will be generated on high-performance computing systems using multiple Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic models linked with a water temperature model. The SWAT hydrologic and water temperature models will be generated using contemporary air temperature and precipitation data as well as future climate data from multiple Global Climate Model scenarios to produce monthly estimates of streamflow volume and water temperature for the years 1950-2099. These data will also be integrated with FishNet 2 (www.fishnet2.net), an established data portal that provides scientists, government agencies, resource managers, and the general public free and open access to occurrences of over 4.1 million species lots of freshwater fishes, globally, and over 2 million lots for the United States and Canada, thus allowing for the characterization of the habitat requirements of freshwater species in this region. Results from these efforts will also allow for examination of the sensitivity of streams throughout the United States and Canada to changes in climate, thus providing a greater understanding of the factors regulating water resources as well as the distribution of freshwater biodiversity both now and in the coming century. The HydroClim data and results of this project will be available online at www.hydroclim.org."

It has become easy to screen the whole genome, transcriptome or metabolome for individual human being and living organisms. These omics profiles enable personalized/precision medicine, and make it possible to solve complex biological problems (aging, brain function etc) or diseases (cancers, obesity etc). However, it remains a major challenge to effectively analyze and interpret these big and complex datasets. The PI's group recently developed the Pathview tool set to map omics data onto molecular pathways (or fundamental biochemical or cellular processes). This project will fully develop Pathview as a systematic solution for omics data visualization, integration and analytics based on pathways. In addition, the whole research community will have open access to this tool and future development. Pathview has generated a global impact within a short time. As an open source project, Pathview not only creates a big user base (tens of thousands) directly, but also fosters a community of dependent projects. Pathview has been adopted by numerous courses in major research institutions and online tutorials. The Pathview project also recruits and trains students and developers and prepare them for careers in the STEM fields. Beyond academia, Pathview is widely used in hospitals, biotech, pharmaceutical and agriculture industry. With this NSF award, the next iteration of the Pathview software will have much deeper and broader impacts.<br/><br/>Pathway analysis has been widely used in omics studies, biomedical research and industry. Pathview maps, integrates and renders a large variety of biological data on molecular and genetic pathways, and produces interpretable graphs with publication quality. Pathview was quickly adopted and widely used by thousands of scientists worldwide. In this Development project, Pathview will be fully developed as a systematic solution for pathway based analytics and visualization. First, a Pathview Web server will be developed, which not only provides a graphic and user-friendly online portal to Pathview, but also extends the static package into an interactive bioinformatics server. Second, the Pathview R package will be expanded in its core functions. It will offer stronger graphic controls for better visualization, and support for more commonly used molecular data and pathway data types. Third, multiple automated pathway analysis workflows will be developed based on Pathview for transcriptomic, genomic and other omics data analysis. More information about the Pathview project will be available at: http://pathview.uncc.edu."

Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. <br/><br/>The Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a ""research ready"" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/)."

Its collections of over 700,000 specimens are used for research, education, and to inform conservation decisions. Implementation of the planned activities will secure this biodiversity data resource for the advancement of scientific research. Specifically, the value and security of the MVZ collections will be enhanced through upgrades to the storage conditions of the ornithology collection. Also, rare specimens and associated information will be cataloged and made accessible, potentially increasing their use in research and informing resource management decisions. The collection includes species that are protected and poorly represented in most museum collections. Additionally, some samples are important for understanding disease spread, reproduction, physiology, and population changes over time. The project will leverage existing outreach efforts at the museum and continue the museum's tradition of student mentorship and training. This will, in part, be achieved through a workshop on the curation and use of museum data. Students and postgraduates will be trained in curation methods, modern collection management and data standards.<br/><br/>This project has two major goals: (1) Enhance pest protection of the MVZ Ornithology collection by replacing a subset of the bird specimen cases to protect against future infestations. This aspect of the project focuses on passerine skins as they comprise the bulk of the MVZ bird collection, are the most actively growing part of the collection, and are most heavily used by researchers. The work performed will also involve reorganization of the collection to reflect current published taxonomies, facilitating its use for research and teaching. (2) Provide long-term security of Ornithology and Herpetology specimens and data by cataloging 14 special acquisitions. Over 3,000 specimens in Ornithology and over 19,000 in Herpetology have been accepted through special donations and specimen transfers of orphaned collections since 1995. These acquisitions include: unique series or specimen preparations not found in other museum collections; specimens of historic and/or geographic relevance to NSF-funded research aimed at documenting faunal change over the past century; and rare and/or endangered and globally diverse amphibian specimens used for studying the effects of deadly chytrid fungus. These acquisitions contain critically important, but currently inaccessible data for scientific research and discovery and they enhance knowledge about biodiversity and environmental change through species, data, and geographic areas that are underrepresented in museum collections. By cataloging these collections, the specimens will be secured long-term and available more quickly to the scientific community. The MVZ is a leader in biodiversity data projects, and all data will be made available globally through Arctos, VertNet, iDigBio, GBIF, and other data portals. Broader impacts of this project include a webcast Digital Curation and Data Quality Workshop and new public displays that further the MVZ's mission. Plans are to develop new community outreach across multiple age groups, and recruit and train new students, postgraduates, and interns. The principal investigators will mentor and/or employ 20 individuals and train an additional 35 participants through the workshop and webcast."

Genes provide the potential for functions an organism can carry out under the right conditions, and genes are expressed to make sure cells can perform the functions they need to live in their environment. Each gene can have a family of expressed forms, and their relationships can be very difficult to sort out without the sequence of the gene itself for comparison, but that sequence is missing for most organisms. The view of gene expression obtained from such experiments is typically fractured, incomplete, and difficult to analyze, the central problem this research addresses. Once reliable analysis methods are worked out, this research will produce software tools that use the methods and are designed to take common errors and missing parts of the data into account. As a check, the reconstructed gene sequences will be compared to known genes in related organisms, and strong relationships will be used to guide predictions of the genes' functions. All predictions will carry with them a number indicating the uncertainty of the information. To ground the research in a biologically interesting question the methods and software will be used to study plants that use an unusual form of energy conversion, C4 photosynthesis, and compare it to the more common form used by plants in order to investigate the different genetic mechanisms, including regulation, used by each type of plant. Predictions will be tested with wet-lab experiments, and analysis methods will then be improved as needed. An on-line community that shares the interests of the researchers will be created and fostered by providing expert advice for carrying out and analyzing similar experiments. <br/><br/>This project will consist of the development of a novel collection of methods, and an integrated set of tools, for the analysis of de novo transcriptomes. There are currently a number of tools that aim to tackle different phases of the de novo transcriptome analysis pipeline (e.g. assembly, clustering, expression quantification and differential expression testing), but none of these provide a well-integrated, principled and efficient approach to this difficult challenge. The methods developed and validated in this project will provide a state-of-the-art pipeline for posing and answering a host of relevant biological questions about how transcripts, genes, and functional modules are differentially expressed and regulated; specifically, in the context of organisms for which a reference genome is lacking.  The project will result in the development of novel methods for the data-driven clustering of contigs in de novo assemblies.  Clustering will be decided on the basis of sequence and expression-level similarities between contigs, accounting for known hallmarks of mis-assemblies to determine contigs that arise from the same underlying transcript. Transcripts will be grouped by predicted, shared exonic structure to discover sub-genic features, genes, and gene families.  The result of this process will be a hierarchical model of the transcriptome.  New methods for efficient quantification and differential expression analysis of these hierarchical models will be developed, including a methodologically-sound approach for propagating measures of quantification uncertainty into downstream analysis.  Finally, these tools will be validated via a large-scale reanalysis of existing de novo transcriptome data targeted at elucidating the identity of genetic regulatory elements involved in C4 photosynthesis. This reanalysis will harness the increased accuracy and efficiency of the methods developed to analyze data from all previous non-model C4 RNA-seq experiments in a single, multi-scale model. The output of the model will be a system for quantitatively prioritizing candidate regulatory elements for detailed molecular investigation. This project also includes broader impact goals that will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students, and which will create an actively-maintained and inclusive online community centered around best practices in de novo transcriptome analysis and experimental design.<br/><br/>For further information regarding progress on this project, including the relevant software being developed, please visit https://combine-lab.github.io/txome."

It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.<br/><br/>The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

Even within a given cell type, individual cells will differ in their exact state due to distinct external<br/>influences, cell's history, or random noise. Such heterogeneity presents a major challenge for modeling and<br/>understanding biological tissues. Rapidly progressing single-cell measurements can now provide<br/>comprehensive data on cell state, enabling unbiased analysis of composition of complex tissues. Such<br/>measurements, however, are inherently noisy and require specialized statistical and computational tools for their<br/>analysis. The project will develop sensitive statistical methods for identification and characterization of<br/>biologically distinct subsets of cells from single-cell transcriptome data, and will apply them to investigate cellular<br/>composition and function of neural tissues in humans, mice and other organisms. Such characterization will<br/>likely provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying brain development. The developed tools will be<br/>widely applicable in other biological contexts. Finally, the instructional material created by this project will<br/>introduce beginning and advanced students to the fundamental set of statistical and computational techniques<br/>necessary to understand modern biological measurements.<br/><br/>The research will develop an approach for analysis cell heterogeneity based on the single-cell transcriptome<br/>data. Model-based factor analysis will be used to capture the structure of the transcriptional heterogeneity within<br/>the measured cell populations in a way that is highly tolerant of technical and biological variability inherent to the<br/>single-cell measurements. Methods for incorporating available spatial information and predicting spatial<br/>localization of subpopulations will be developed. Statistical methods will be developed to identify gene<br/>regulatory dependencies from single-cell data. The approaches will be applied to analysis of transcriptional<br/>heterogeneity and regulatory processes in neuronal tissues of humans and model organisms. To facilitate<br/>teaching of relevant analysis methods, the project will develop a series of interactive exercises, which will<br/>illustrate common counting processes that underlie the assumptions of most analysis methods, statistical tools<br/>for estimating uncertainty from count data, and common algorithms used to process single-cell sequencing data.<br/>To reach wider student audience the interactive instructional tools will have an adaptable difficulty level and will<br/>be directly accessible over the web.

Most of the differences among living organisms ultimately can be traced to genetic variation, including humans. Patterns of genetic differences in a species appear across different groups, due to events such as changes in population size, migration between populations, or long periods of isolation. Understanding, for example, how beneficial mutations can be established in a natural population of a certain size that has migration limits is important for understanding aspects of human health, conservation genetics, breeding in agriculture and many other research areas.  Recent technological advances have made it fast and inexpensive to obtain genetic sequences from many individuals, assuming samples can be collected. A number of software packages provide models that estimate what prior events looked like from current genetic data, including biological parameters such as population size or migration rate. However, each assumes a particular mathematic model of population demography and are limited to estimating parameters from a subset of the biological processes that may influence genetic variation. A poor match between the assumptions of the analytical model and the true population history will produce inaccurate parameter estimates that are likely to mislead the biological inference. This project will develop software that enables biologists to assess how appropriate a particular software package is to a given set of genetic data. Therefore, it will benefit society by improving the quality of biological inferences drawn from genetic data, ranging from efforts to protect endangered species to investigations into the history of viral pathogens.<br/><br/>Bayesian inference is commonly used to analyze genetic data because it provides a computationally efficient approach to identifying highly-probable regions of parameter space, but all such inference is conditional on the models chosen to use in the analysis. While analytical models exist that can estimate parameters associated with all population-level biological processes, such as genetic drift, phylogenetic divergence, gene flow, population size change, etc., computational limitations prevent any given analytical model of incorporating more than a handful of these processes. Biologists typically choose which analytical method to use intuitively, and generally lack approaches for assessing the absolute statistical fit of a model given the genetic data. Consequently, the inferences that result from the analysis of genetic data are effectively conditional on the appropriateness of the model used to analyze the data, although they are rarely presented in such terms. The proposed work will develop and implement a considerable expansion of the P2C2M R package, which currently implements posterior predictive simulation to assess the statistical fit of a single model - the multispecies coalescent model. The work will expand P2C2M such that the statistical fit of additional coalescent methods can be evaluated. By expanding P2C2M, the work promotes the consideration of model fit as an important step within the overall process of making biological inferences from genetic data. Biologists have devoted a great deal of energy to justify the models that they use to analyze their data using verbal reasoning and qualitative arguments, but have generally lacked the tools and statistical framework to do so in a direct quantitative manner. P2C2M will provide these tools by the time of project completion. As a direct consequence of the expanded P2C2M R package, the inferences made by evolutionary geneticists will be more insightful and because researchers and their audiences will have enhanced confidence in the choice of analytical models from which these inferences are derived. The work will enhance biological inferences with important societal benefit, such as the identification of cryptic species, understanding the demography of invasive species and disease vectors, and the movement of alleles across the landscape in endangered species.

Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has a long history of exploring the ocean biodiversity. These efforts have produced a unique collection of specimens designated as the Marine Biotechnology Reference Collection (MBRC). The MBRC is a taxonomically and geographically diverse collection of more than 31,500 preserved benthic marine invertebrates and macroalgae (seaweeds). This collection is unique in that nearly 30% of the samples were selectively collected by the manned Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles at depths of more than 150 m, from locations that are otherwise difficult to access by trawling or dredging due to rugged topography or reef habitats. Collection by submersible means that these specimens are relatively intact compared to those traditionally collected with trawl or dredge. This collection is also unique in that it includes in situ photographs and videotapes.  Collections that were made over a period of 30 years or more provides an opportunity to study changes over time. Research on the specimens, data, images, and videos has already contributed to a better understanding of evolutionary biology, ecology, characterization of marine habitats, and resource management, and has been vital to HBOI's drug discovery program. A goal of this project is to provide the scientific community access to these unique samples and accompanying data. The excellent condition of the specimens makes them useful for molecular analyses, and the videos provide important data to characterize poorly known marine habitats, some of which support commercially and recreationally important fish and invertebrate species.   <br/><br/>An outcome of the project will be a web-accessible version of the collection database, including photos and annotated video clips, for use by researchers, students and the general public worldwide. The collection consists of a complete set of fully digitized dive logs and specimen photographs and thousands of hours of video recordings. Collection data will be verified for accuracy.  Specimens will be barcode labeled for ease in accessing; they are currently organized by collection date in a temperature-controlled environment.  Digitized videotapes will be annotated and linked to the specimen database.  Links to the specimen database will ensure that the complete set of data - specimens, field notes, collection data, photographic images, and videos - can be made publicly available on-line.  Results of this project will be shared and made available to researchers, resource managers, students, and the public through the HBOI-FAU website and through iDigBio.  Digitizing the MBRC and publishing the data on the web will expand the availability and impact of the collection beyond the limitations of an internal, static repository, and will promote teaching, training, and learning in basic and interdisciplinary research in a variety of STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the sensitivity of flowering times to climatic conditions, a thorough understanding of how plants respond to changing environments is necessary for predicting the consequences for pollinators, herbivores, parasites, and plant populations.  A record of historical flowering times is found within the nation's herbaria.  This award establishes a thematic collection network (TCN) dedicated to understanding flowering time shifts in the California flora.  California has the most diverse native flora of any state in the U.S., containing more than one-third of all U.S. plant species.  The state is a biodiversity hotspot due to the high number of endemic species that are also threatened.  The Capturing California's Flowers (CCF) TCN will record flowering times from and create images of over 900,000 herbarium specimens from the oldest records, the most diverse families, and most threatened families in California.  Twenty-two institutions spanning the state, including public universities, state agencies, museums, and botanic gardens, will participate in these efforts.  This project will generate data that will increase our understanding of flowering time shifts - a critical need for agriculturalists, conservation biologists, plant taxonomists, land managers, and wildlife biologists.<br/><br/>Digitization of each specimen in the CCF TCN will result in a high-resolution image, a databased record of collection metadata, a georeferenced point, and the reproductive status of the specimen.  New tools will be developed for the public to search and display phenological data through a Symbiota portal interface.  The CCF TCN will develop novel data standards for capturing and sharing trait data from specimens.  Building on already successful national and regional programs, the CCF TCN will partner with schools, universities, botanical clubs, and the general public to crowd source phenological measurements through online expeditions, workshops, new college courses, and K-12 educational programs.  The CCF TCN will provide a historical record of plants currently being monitored through the National Phenology Network and other regional programs.

RFID refers to a form of simple, short-distance wireless communication between small uniquely-identifiable transponder tags and an interrogator or reader. When a tag is attached to an animal, strategically placed readers can detect and record an animal's presence at key locations such as nests and food sources. The new RFID system is based on an existing design currently in use by dozens of researchers around the world that has enabled several new insights into the ecology and behavior of both free-living and lab animals. With improvements to this existing system, the research and development team will create a device that is highly customizable yet accessible to non-engineers. More specific improvements include capacity for wireless data transfer, accommodations for a wide array of additional sensors and actuators that can greatly expand the utility of the RFID system, and an online tool for designing customized antenna coils to meet specific user needs. The RFID system will be made available to users through multiple avenues, including online instructions, user-assembled reader kits, and fully constructed units, all of which will cost less than $50 per unit. With these low-cost self-assembly options, the RFID system will serve not only as a data collection tool for biologists but also as a vehicle for STEM education.<br/><br/>In the development of this instrument changes to the existing RFID hardware will include a more sophisticated microcontroller and a new RFID integrated circuit (to replace a device that has become obsolete). The firmware for the device will be rewritten and transferred from a proprietary language (Picbasic Pro) to Energia, which is a freely available open-source development environment based on the same framework used in many hobbyist electronic systems, like Arduino. Data output from the RFID reader will be configured for direct uploading into the ETAG database, which has been established by the development team with funding from the Advances in Biological Informatics program at NSF. The project will support several student-led projects that involve both testing the RFID system and creating accessory devices, such as electronic balances or infrared motion detectors, that can interface with the RFID system to provide additional data-collection capabilities. Ultimately, the new system will eliminate all barriers to the use of RFID technology in biological research. The sum total of the system improvements will give rise to an instrument that is affordable in the context virtually any serious research effort, customizable to an extent that allows for a wide range of field and lab deployment scenarios, accommodating to additional forms of data collection, and accessible to non-engineers such that biologists are able to establish systems themselves."

These records join the SERNEC data set that contribute information about plant diversity in the North American Coastal Plain, an area rich in rare, unique species. The SERNEC data set is a one-stop resource for taxonomic and ecological research and botanical education and aids in the revision of state checklists of plants and specimen curation. Student interns will have opportunities to develop professional skills in team work, communication, and goal-setting, as well as exploring potential career options in museum management. Citizen-scientists aiding in digitization will have opportunities to interact with project personnel and learn about the importance of natural history collections in education and research and local plant diversity. Educational materials developed for K-12 classes will enhance botanical literacy and illustrate plant diversity, structure and geographical range in the Southeast.<br/> <br/>Images and associated label data for approximately 118,000 vascular plant specimens in the three herbaria will be captured digitally and accessible online at the SERNEC Symbiota Portal and the iDigBio Specimen Portal. If lacking, georeferenced coordinates for the collection location of each specimen will be determined and added to the database. These activities expand the use of software packages that were enhanced for use in the SERNEC project, including Symbiota, GEOLocate, and Zooniverse. Original data, including images and text, will be retained long-term at institutional repositories of the herbaria involved in this project. Specimen digitization will be conducted by undergraduate student interns at each of the institutions and citizen-scientists, including the Virginia Master Naturalists and volunteers working in Notes from Nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this day, the most fundamental and common way to accomplish this relies on organism names, making these one of the pillars of querying and managing our biological knowledge and data. However, the traditionally used names for organisms and groups of organisms, which are based in Linnaean nomenclature, suffer from two major limitations to their usefulness when it comes to integrating and communicating data. First, because they are simple text-strings, the meaning intended by those who coin a name and those who apply it is inaccessible to machines. As a result, exactly which organism a name is or is not meant to include is often ambiguous, and names are therefore often applied inconsistently. Second, there are many groups of organisms that do not yet and may never have a Linnaean name, but for which molecular or macroscopic characteristics have been discovered that constitute valuable biological knowledge. This project aims to address these issues by generating a mechanism, called phyloreferencing, that allows referring to any group of organisms of shared evolutionary descent by a machine-interpretable definition of the unique pattern of descent that distinguishes the group from all others. This project builds on more than a decade's worth of theoretical and applied research into phylogenetic taxonomy. With the recent synthesis and continuous update of a universal phylogenetic Tree of Life, phyloreferences will have immediate and broad practical applications for communicating, integrating, and querying biological data across the Tree of Life. In contrast to authoritative nomenclatural naming, the goal for phyloreferences is that users can construct them instantly for any group of shared evolutionary descent for which they wish to communicate discoveries. In addition to developing the phyloreferencing standard and supporting tools, this project also aims to create classroom-ready teaching materials and curricula for training biology students in the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of phylogenetic nomenclature. <br/><br/>The phyloreferencing mechanism that this project will develop uses standards and tools developed for the Web, specifically the Web Ontology Language (OWL), ontologies, and machine reasoning. Specifically, this work aims to develop phyloreferences as OWL class expressions consisting of sufficient and necessary conditions, which machine reasoners can use to identify subclasses and class instances. Ontology and reasoning technologies have already shown their power for biological knowledge integration and discovery and are increasingly being adopted for evolutionary research as well. As part of this project, a specification for constructing and computing with phyloreferences within an ontological framework will be researched, implemented, and tested. Phyloreferences will be designed with the goal that any element, whether node, branch, or clades, on the Tree of Life can be referenced in a way that is unambiguous and has fully computable semantics defined by patterns of evolutionary relatedness. The main objectives of this research include creating a formal specification for phyloreference and phylogeny encoding and reasoning in OWL; ascertaining correctness of the specification using small-scale tests verifiable by domain experts; and finally scaling the approach to a large-scale biodiversity data resource navigation proof-of-concept application. Specifically phyloreferences will be developed and integrated into Open Tree of Life, ARBOR and projects newly funded by the Genealogy of Life program. Results of the project will be available at http://www.phyloref.org."

RFID refers to a form of simple, short-distance wireless communication between small uniquely-identifiable transponder tags and an interrogator or reader. When a tag is attached to an animal, strategically placed readers can detect and record an animal's presence at key locations such as nests and food sources. The new RFID system is based on an existing design currently in use by dozens of researchers around the world that has enabled several new insights into the ecology and behavior of both free-living and lab animals. With improvements to this existing system, the research and development team will create a device that is highly customizable yet accessible to non-engineers. More specific improvements include capacity for wireless data transfer, accommodations for a wide array of additional sensors and actuators that can greatly expand the utility of the RFID system, and an online tool for designing customized antenna coils to meet specific user needs. The RFID system will be made available to users through multiple avenues, including online instructions, user-assembled reader kits, and fully constructed units, all of which will cost less than $50 per unit. With these low-cost self-assembly options, the RFID system will serve not only as a data collection tool for biologists but also as a vehicle for STEM education.<br/><br/>In the development of this instrument changes to the existing RFID hardware will include a more sophisticated microcontroller and a new RFID integrated circuit (to replace a device that has become obsolete). The firmware for the device will be rewritten and transferred from a proprietary language (Picbasic Pro) to Energia, which is a freely available open-source development environment based on the same framework used in many hobbyist electronic systems, like Arduino. Data output from the RFID reader will be configured for direct uploading into the ETAG database, which has been established by the development team with funding from the Advances in Biological Informatics program at NSF. The project will support several student-led projects that involve both testing the RFID system and creating accessory devices, such as electronic balances or infrared motion detectors, that can interface with the RFID system to provide additional data-collection capabilities. Ultimately, the new system will eliminate all barriers to the use of RFID technology in biological research. The sum total of the system improvements will give rise to an instrument that is affordable in the context virtually any serious research effort, customizable to an extent that allows for a wide range of field and lab deployment scenarios, accommodating to additional forms of data collection, and accessible to non-engineers such that biologists are able to establish systems themselves."

The specimens held in long-term trust in these collections constitute an irreplaceable resource for current and future generations of scientists seeking to answer the biological questions of today, and the unknown questions of tomorrow.  The Texas A&M University Insect Collection (TAMUIC) is a major research collection of terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates with approximately 2.9 million specimens and regional strengths in the faunas of the southwestern U.S. and northern neotropics.  The collection is an important node in the physical infrastructure documenting invertebrate biodiversity throughout these regions.  It supports one of the most active educational and research programs in systematic entomology in the U.S., and provides scientists across the U.S. and around the world with access to high-quality specimens for research.  The supported project will enhance the TAMUIC in two significant ways.  First, it will allow the TAMUIC to acquire and incorporate the Dean Araneae Collection, a nationally-important collection of spiders built up over the course of a 40-year career by Mr. Allen Dean.  Second, the acquisition of the Dean collection presents a logical and timely opportunity for the TAMUIC to undertake a comprehensive recuration of its entire collection of alcohol-preserved specimens, and to capture fundamental taxonomic, geographic, and temporal data from both collections in order to make those data available for use in studies in many scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>The search for scientific solutions to complex environmental problems has become increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary, and relies more and more on materials and data from multiple sources.  Meaningful investigation of large-scale problems in particular will come to depend upon ready access to shared sets of relevant data that can be pooled on demand from multiple digital sources and subjected to appropriate analysis.  This project will capture and make available to the research community more than 50,000 new, vial-level, digital records of terrestrial and freshwater insects and arachnids.  Importantly, it will also facilitate the long-term preservation of the physical specimens upon which those records are based.  The ability of the TAMUIC to continue to serve as a source of high-quality, ethanol-based materials for the scientific community will be enhanced by the project's support for a comprehensive re-curation effort covering all of the TAMUIC's alcohol materials, including conversion of the collection from a free-vial to a double containment specimen storage system.  Collection cabinetry will be upgraded to meet applicable standards; curatorial materials will be standardized throughout and upgraded to archival quality; and ethanol collections will be consolidated into a single physical space.  The project is an integral part of the TAMUIC's long-term plan to upgrade its resources to modern collections-community standards.  Specimen data digitized as part of this project will be shared with iDigBio (iDigBio.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists study these specimens intently; however, it is difficult to retrieve information at broad geographic and taxonomic scales without pipelines to move the information electronically from the specimen to an accessible pool of data.  SERNEC, or the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections, is a large regional network of botanical experts and collections that has, through an NSF-sponsored research coordination network (RCN) project, developed critical skills in biodiversity informatics.  The current project will allow the SERNEC group to make data available for over 3 million specimens using the latest photography and information capture tools and to engage citizen scientists and students to assist in transcribing and georeferencing this large dataset.  The research generated through this project can help regional planners, land managers and communities to manage their natural resources in our ever-changing environment.  <br/><br/>The interaction of scientists, citizen scientists, and students will provide a synergy to build a research tool of an unparalleled scale and scope.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an imaged and databased set of over 3 million specimens from over 100 herbaria in one of the most floristically diverse regions in North America and a global hotspot of plant diversity. This will represent a valuable data source for research on the response of vegetation to climate change, human development, and rapid migrations of introduced species. This region has been a biodiversity hotspot for 100 million years and this project should encourage research on changes over time to develop better predictive models as areas of biodiversity change.

Each tissue carefully regulates the set of proteins that it produces, both of the types of protein made and the amounts of each. For instance, the proteins that make up the structure and enable the function of the heart are different from those defining the lungs or brain. A deep understanding of the processes that control what proteins are made and how this is timed is of fundamental scientific importance, with implications throughout biology. This project focuses on two critical points in protein regulation: the step in which genes are read off of the genomic DNA to make the intermediate mRNA (called transcription), and the step in which some pieces of the mRNA are removed and the ends reconnected (called splicing), so that translation to protein will result in versions with distinct properties. Complete profiling of mRNA produced by tissues is possible but results in very large, complex data sets. This project will create software tools to facilitate efficient analyses of these data sets, making sense of the two processes described above. The results can be applied to investigate a wide variety of biological questions. Besides the scientific contributions, several educational and outreach activities are aimed at students at the high school and undergraduate levels. In particular, a summer workshop will be organized to provide hands-on bioinformatics experiences to local high school teachers and representative students. Students in the University of Maryland Terrapin Teacher program will be mentored to create lesson plans in Bioinformatics; the lessons will subsequently be delivered at local high schools. In addition, high school students will be invited to participate in summer research experiences under the mentorship of the PIs.<br/><br/>Cellular morphology and function is determined by precise regulation of gene activity. A long-term goal of biological research is to fully decipher the mechanisms of gene regulation. Spatial and temporal regulation of final gene products is primarily executed when genes are transcribed and the resulting RNA is processed. In turn, transcriptional regulation is mediated by regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, which are characterized by diffuse clusters of short degenerate DNA motifs. An important task in the analysis of the transcriptional regulation involves comparison of regulatory regions, both within and across genomes. With regards to post-transcriptional processing events, critical first steps are identification, characterization and quantification of alternatively processed variants of a gene. Increasingly, sequence data are available that hold the answers to these questions, but which must be mined in order to extract their secrets. The scale of the task of incorporating the massive amounts of next generation sequencing data render conventional solutions inefficient and thus presents a major computational bottleneck. The proposed research will develop efficient algorithms and tools for the analysis of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by exploiting recently developed ultrafast data structures for DNA words or k-mers. The proposed solutions to two related but different fundamental problems - quantification of regulatory region similarity, and quantification of alternative isoforms of a gene, provide an alternative to traditional approaches by reformulating the problems in terms of k-mer similarity searches, for which extremely efficient solutions have been recently developed and exploited for related problems, including transcript quantification (e.g. Sailfish).  The proposed tools will enable investigation of certain fundamental mechanistic and evolutionary questions pertaining to transcriptional regulation and analysis of splice isoform variants at an unprecedented scale. <br/>The research goals will be tied to several STEM educational activities focused on local high school students, both in terms of early research involvement and classroom education. Some of these activities will be organized at the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CBCB), thereby encouraging the close interaction between the students and the center faculty.<br/>The link to the results will be provided at PI's lab page at cbcb.umd.edu/~sridhar/software.html"

It is not practical to experimentally test all possible changes; it is possible to develop computational rules and methods to accurately predict the effect of most changes, reserving experimental testing for borderline cases. The rules that constrain functional protein sequences, the structures into which they fold, the stability of the structures and the transitions that occur can be organized into an informatics framework that helps distinguish functional from non-functional mutations. The stability and dynamic transitions of protein structures over many mutations are the focus of this research, for which new evaluation methods will be developed and tested. Once the assessment methodologies are validated they will be integrated, along with the raw data and assessment results, within a single, efficient computational platform. The ability to interpret new data and compare it to existing results will not only allow discrimination of beneficial, neutral and deleterious mutations, but provides a resource for a protein-sequence-structure-based understanding of evolution. Informed selection rules will enable better decisions about the importance of saving individual members of endangered species, as well as how different environments affect selection in individual species. <br/><br/>There is a large body of data in protein sequences and structures that can aid in understanding evolution, which is not currently being used. This project will utilize this data in systematic ways to shed new light on evolution.  Protein structures are often modeled in different computational ways; the evaluation of these structure models is critical for expanding the set of reliable structures, since there are huge numbers of possible mutant sequences. Changes to the protein sequences and structures are not fully understood. Part of the difficulty lies in understanding the interactions within their densely packed structures, which have significant interdependences.  Developing new ways to evaluate the effects of dense packing on protein structures is one of the project?s aims. Focusing on the physically interacting clusters within protein structures together with their sequence variants provides rich information about the correlations among amino acid substitutions. This rich data will then significantly advance the ability to distinguish between the important and the unimportant mutations. Progress has been seen with these approaches in the evaluations of predicted structure models at the CASP competitions for protein structure prediction.  These new approaches lend themselves directly to the evaluation of the stabilities of different protein mutants. The evaluation procedures are derived directly from the available sets of protein structures and carefully tested against other known structures. In one important innovation these now include entropies that account for known changes in the structures of individual proteins, i.e. their dynamics.  Capturing these tendencies for changes significantly improves the evaluation of the stabilities of proteins.   Applications to sets of mutants show that unfavorable mutants are either more stable or less stable than the normal cases.  These changes in stability directly affect the ways in which the proteins can move to carry out their functions; evaluating these changes significantly aids the understanding of protein mutations.  This project will yield a uniform way to reliably assess the effects of protein mutations.  This ability will significantly aid in the understanding of many aspects of evolution that remain."

The Sperry Herbarium also houses important historical collections of past curators, voucher specimens of previous regional, national and international research projects, and research material of the present curator. Specimen usage internally and externally has increased in recent years following internal efforts to digitize information. The availability of data online significantly augments the value of specimens for current and future uses in systematics, ecology, land-use management, and other disciplines that rely on the distributional data of plants.<br/> <br/>This project provides support for infrastructure upgrades and expansion for the T.M. Sperry Herbarium. The acquisition of 67 new full and 12 half-sized herbarium cabinets will expand its specimen capacity significantly, enhance the long-term security and preservation of collections, and allow for moderate but sustained expansion for approximately thirty years.  It also supports moving the Sperry Herbarium next door to the Hartman Building into a larger and more suitable location, which will increase overall workspace and enhance work-flow efficiencies.  The project plant includes data basing, georeferencing, and digital imaging of specimens and the accessibility of all data online through the NSF-funded iDigBio project (idigbio.org) and other portals such as The Consortium of Northern Great Plains Herbaria. Support for student training includes funding for a Masters student and four undergraduate students to assist with curation and move of the herbarium to its new facilities.  As a regional state-supported rural university, Pittsburg State University serves many first-generation college students and many from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  Overall, the project will significantly enhance teaching, research, and outreach of the T.M. Sperry Herbarium and provide numerous experiential learning opportunities in one of the STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Along the U.S. west coast, strong winds bring water that is rich in nitrate from the deep ocean to the sunlit ocean surface. This coastal upwelling process fuels growth and productivity at the base of the marine food web, but is also linked to low-oxygen conditions and harmful algal blooms along the coast. In addition to wind-driven upwelling along the coast, runoff of nitrate from land can cause excess enrichment of organic matter in estuaries, leading to low-oxygen conditions and habitat degradation. Traditional measurements of nitrate use chemical methods that are time consuming and limit the quantity of samples to those that can be physically collected in bottles. Recent advances in optical sensor technology have made it possible to collect nitrate data rapidly (up to one sample per second), allowing the collection of data with much greater detail. The purpose of this project is to make high-resolution sensing of nitrate a standard measurement at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML, https://www.mlml.calstate.edu) in central Monterey Bay, CA. Measuring nitrate alongside other observations of ocean conditions and water quality will provide a more complete picture of how nutrient availability changes over the course of days and months, and at small spatial scales down to meters in Monterey Bay and nearby estuaries. The use of high-resolution nitrate sensing at MLML will bring advanced technology into the classroom and provide new opportunities for student research. Training in the use and calibration of modern nitrate sensing technology will take place in the classroom, and students will have access to equipment and data for independent research. The nitrate sensors will support research on harmful algal blooms, regional impacts of ocean acidification, sustainable aquaculture, and estuarine water quality.<br/><br/>Nitrate concentrations are influenced by many physical, biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes, including coastal upwelling, internal waves, photosynthesis, aerobic respiration, denitrification, and agricultural runoff. Nitrate fuels primary productivity, which is often also associated with low oxygen, eutrophication and harmful algae. However, the complex spatial distributions of nitrate, and the wide range of time scales of variability, are difficult to characterize with traditional methods. Recent advances in sensor technology have made it possible to measure variability in nitrate concentrations at the short temporal and spatial scales that characterize estuaries and coastal upwelling regions. The goal of this project is to make high-resolution sensing of nitrate a standard measurement on four observing platforms at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML, https://www.mlml.calstate.edu): 1) a seawater intake system that continuously measures subsurface water properties, 2) a vertically profiling rosette on a 56 ft. coastal research vessel, 3) an underway data acquisition system that continuously measures surface water properties on the same vessel, and 4) a portable underway data acquisition system that can be readily deployed on any small boat or pier. These research platforms already support an array of physical, biological and chemical sensors for interdisciplinary research in Monterey Bay and surrounding waters. Installing nitrate sensors on four complementary observing platforms would provide researchers in the Monterey Bay region with a strong foundation for understanding how nitrate and phytoplankton biomass vary both in time and space."

To this day, the most fundamental and common way to accomplish this relies on organism names, making these one of the pillars of querying and managing our biological knowledge and data. However, the traditionally used names for organisms and groups of organisms, which are based in Linnaean nomenclature, suffer from two major limitations to their usefulness when it comes to integrating and communicating data. First, because they are simple text-strings, the meaning intended by those who coin a name and those who apply it is inaccessible to machines. As a result, exactly which organism a name is or is not meant to include is often ambiguous, and names are therefore often applied inconsistently. Second, there are many groups of organisms that do not yet and may never have a Linnaean name, but for which molecular or macroscopic characteristics have been discovered that constitute valuable biological knowledge. This project aims to address these issues by generating a mechanism, called phyloreferencing, that allows referring to any group of organisms of shared evolutionary descent by a machine-interpretable definition of the unique pattern of descent that distinguishes the group from all others. This project builds on more than a decade's worth of theoretical and applied research into phylogenetic taxonomy. With the recent synthesis and continuous update of a universal phylogenetic Tree of Life, phyloreferences will have immediate and broad practical applications for communicating, integrating, and querying biological data across the Tree of Life. In contrast to authoritative nomenclatural naming, the goal for phyloreferences is that users can construct them instantly for any group of shared evolutionary descent for which they wish to communicate discoveries. In addition to developing the phyloreferencing standard and supporting tools, this project also aims to create classroom-ready teaching materials and curricula for training biology students in the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of phylogenetic nomenclature. <br/><br/>The phyloreferencing mechanism that this project will develop uses standards and tools developed for the Web, specifically the Web Ontology Language (OWL), ontologies, and machine reasoning. Specifically, this work aims to develop phyloreferences as OWL class expressions consisting of sufficient and necessary conditions, which machine reasoners can use to identify subclasses and class instances. Ontology and reasoning technologies have already shown their power for biological knowledge integration and discovery and are increasingly being adopted for evolutionary research as well. As part of this project, a specification for constructing and computing with phyloreferences within an ontological framework will be researched, implemented, and tested. Phyloreferences will be designed with the goal that any element, whether node, branch, or clades, on the Tree of Life can be referenced in a way that is unambiguous and has fully computable semantics defined by patterns of evolutionary relatedness. The main objectives of this research include creating a formal specification for phyloreference and phylogeny encoding and reasoning in OWL; ascertaining correctness of the specification using small-scale tests verifiable by domain experts; and finally scaling the approach to a large-scale biodiversity data resource navigation proof-of-concept application. Specifically phyloreferences will be developed and integrated into Open Tree of Life, ARBOR and projects newly funded by the Genealogy of Life program.

It is imperative that we understand how the biosphere is responding to and affecting earth's physical systems, yet our understanding of the biosphere does not match our increasingly sophisticated understanding of the earth's physical and chemical systems at regional, continental, and global scales. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is designed to understand and predict: (1) how ecosystems work and respond to changes, especially at large scales; (2) how ecosystem processes feed back to alter earth system processes, including climate and hydrology; and (3) the implications of these processes and feedbacks for human endeavors. NEON will enable research on the impacts of climate and land use change, unsustainable water use, and invasive species on the Nation's living ecosystems at the temporal and spatial scales that are relevant to human well-being. NEON will be the first research platform and the only national experimental facility specifically designed to enable research to answer continental-scale questions on causes of and responses to environmental change and the mechanisms involved in observed changes. NEON will be the first experimental facility to collect consistent and standardized biological measurements across nationwide sites and to make the data available in close to real-time. <br/><br/>This award provides Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction funds to construct NEON. Funds are provided to deploy geographically distributed field and lab infrastructure networked via cybertechnology to form an integrated research platform. Cutting-edge sensor networks, instrumentation, experimental infrastructure, cyberinfrastructure, support facilities including towers and board walks, and biological sampling plots will be deployed in the continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. Three airborne remote sensing systems and mobile laboratories will be constructed. Funds are provided for central technical, cyberinfrastructure, and project management facilities and support staff. Resources are provided to develop the NEON data products and to integrate federal agency operational data resources. Funds are provided to develop NEON's education and outreach portals and staff training programs. The data from these resources will be linked to computational, analytical, and modeling capabilities to create NEON's integrated infrastructure."

Microbiomes in the natural environment, including those associated with animals and plants, have thousands of interacting microbial species. Microbial communities influence key aspects of host health and behavior. They drive basic biochemical processes in their hosts, such as nutrient processing in the guts and sequestration of carbon in the Earth's oceans. The study of microbiomes has been recently revolutionized by the use of advanced sequencing technologies. However, large-scale sequencing initiatives, such as the Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Microbiome Project, are generating Petabytes (10 to the power of 15 bytes) of data, more than existing analysis tools can handle. The goal of this project is to develop transformative computational methods and implement software tools that enable the analysis of these very large datasets. Specifically, these tools will provide improved methods to organize community gene expression data (metatranscriptomes) into metabolic pathways, which informs predictions of how biochemical processes transform matter and energy. To maximize its impact, the developed software tools will be made available to the research community as stand-alone open source packages and deployed on common cloud computing environments. The project will provide opportunities for mentoring undergraduate and graduate students at Georgia State University, University of Connecticut, and Georgia Tech and promote participation of women and underrepresented groups in bioinformatics research and empirical analysis of community-level sequence (DNA/RNA) datasets. Selected aspects of the proposed research will be incorporated in courses at the three universities, and form the basis of innovative curriculum and educational materials, including the creation of mobile applications. <br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and environmental microbiologists to develop and implement computational tools that enable de novo analysis of large multi-sample microbiome sequencing datasets, addressing current challenges in metatranscriptome assembly and inference of metabolic pathway activity. Specific aims of the project include: (i) developing highly scalable algorithms for de novo assembly and quantification from multiple metatranscriptomic samples, (ii) developing highly accurate algorithms for estimation of metabolic pathway activity level and differential activity testing, (iii) developing and validating prototype implementations of developed methods. A distinguishing feature of the developed methods will be their ability to jointly analyze multiple related metatranscriptomic samples. This joint assembly and quantification paradigm is likely to find applications beyond microbiome research, e.g., in the emerging area of single cell genomics.

The fellow, Naomi Schwartz, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by Jennifer Powers at the University of Minnesota. The fellow's research explores how seasonality, in particular the timing of rainfall, affects how plants use water in seasonally dry tropical forests. Some dry forests experience a very rainy, wet season followed by a dry season with virtually no rainfall, while other forests experience low, but constant, rainfall throughout the year, and still other forests have two distinct dry seasons. These differences in rainfall could affect the way plants use water and cope with drought. For example, species that are adapted to severe seasonal drought may be more resilient to future droughts. However, we still do not understand how seasonality affects plant water use. This is important, because climate change is already causing shifts in rainfall seasonality and increases in drought, and we cannot predict how these changes will affect seasonally dry tropical forests. The fellow is using herbarium collections from across Latin America, which are being used to measure plant characteristics related to water-use, as well as satellite imagery to observe links between seasonality, photosynthesis, and plant growth. In terms of broader impacts, the fellow is training students in using herbarium collections and satellite imagery for global change research, and incorporating her results into earth system models that other scientists can use.<br/><br/>Because rainfall regimes vary temporally and over broad geographic scales, a key challenge to understanding how seasonality affects composition and function in tropical forests has been collecting data at the spatial scales necessary to encompass a range of rainfall regimes. The fellow's research addresses this challenge by using data from herbarium collections and remote sensing: both are uniquely suited to analyzing ecological patterns across broad spatial and temporal scales but are rarely combined into an integrated research program. The fellow is measuring traits related to water use on plant specimens at four herbaria throughout the Neotropics, and using these measurements to assess how rainfall seasonality affects trait variation within and across species in seasonally dry tropical forests. She is also using remote sensing to map leaf phenology and productivity, to assess how they are influenced by rainfall seasonality. Few studies have used herbarium specimens to examine a suite of traits related to hydraulic function, and the proposed research is making major contributions in terms of demonstrating the feasibility of using herbarium collections for study of plant functional ecology and global change."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The fellow is studying evolutionary patterns in early mammals by examining fossil jaws. Since the Mesozoic Era, or the Age of Dinosaurs, mammals have been able to expand into many different geographical locations. However, how mammals were able to do this, and when they began their expansion are still heavily debated.  The fellow will investigate this topic by collecting shape data on a large sample of fossil jaws from several natural history museums. Mammal jaws are especially informative because their shape is correlated with diet, thus providing clues about the mammals' ecologies. This research will contribute to our understanding of the origins of modern mammalian diversity. Further, the study focuses on evolutionary patterns before and after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event, thus offering information on how mammals are affected by mass extinction events. The fellow will expand the impact of this project by participating in numerous teaching, mentoring, and outreach opportunities, including the Discoveries in Geosciences Field School for K-12 teachers.<br/>  <br/>It is often hypothesized that early mammals experienced an adaptive radiation following one of three globally transformative events: (1) the rise of flowering plants ~80 million years ago (Ma), (2) the K-Pg mass extinction 66 Ma, and (3) the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 56 Ma. However, previous research on these hypotheses often lack ecological data or phylogenetic considerations, prohibiting proper testing of adaptive radiations. Thus, the primary aim of this project is to use ecomorphological and biomechanical data from jaw morphologies to examine macroevolutionary patterns, allowing robust tests of evolutionary hypotheses and providing novel insight into the origins of modern mammalian diversity. The fellow will collect measurements and shape data on hundreds of fossil jaws from the Cretaceous through Eocene (145-34 Ma), utilizing paleontological collections from several natural history museums. Hypotheses on the timing of the early mammal radiation will be tested by calculating morphological disparity patterns through time and using phylogenetic modeling methods to assess potential changes in the mode of evolution at different points in time. The fellow will be trained in advanced phylogenetic comparative methods and quantitative paleontological techniques, and results from this project will be presented at scientific conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accurately determining how much RNA is produced and the structure of that RNA are the goals of this research. Many experiments do high throughput sequencing of RNA to show how much gene expression is taking place, what parts of the genomic DNA are making the RNA, and how DNA regions combine to make functional RNA. There are many steps required to process RNA and get sequence data, leading to a lot of noise in the data. Errors also occur when trying to compare the RNA sequence to a genome sequence that has gaps in it or that was not correctly assembled. The effect of the noise and errors is that calculating how much of each type of RNA is present is not very accurate, which can give misleading results. The aim of this research is to develop methods that overcome the technical problems so that good quantitation and better understanding of biological processes are possible. The new algorithms will be incorporated into software packages available for use by interested members of the scientific community, so that the benefits of the improvements will be widely shared. In addition, better analysis of RNA sequencing experiments is expected to have a positive impact on many scientific disciplines, from basic cell biology to development of clinical tests.  <br/><br/>High-throughput sequencing of RNA has proven itself as an invaluable tool for gene discovery and the annotation of new isoforms for both coding and non-coding genes. However, it is still falls short on its ultimate promise of providing quantitative and comparative measures of transcript abundance. This gap is due to a series of technical factors. Among them are biases introduced by employing an inexact reference genome as the standard for associating sequence data to transcripts, noise due to misalignments causes by paralogous sequence such as pseudogenes, biases introduced by unannotated transcripts, sense/antisense transcript interference, and origin bias due to aligning diploid data to a haploid model. The objective of the project is to develop methods that either overcome or side-step all of these factors in an effort to deliver on the promise of RNA sequencing for quantitative analysis. Our research plan includes developing computational models and efficient algorithms for simultaneous rebalancing reads between genes and pseudogenes and genes within gene families, robust alignment-free methods for estimating transcript abundances and allele-specific expression patterns, and de novo approach for isoform and novel transcript discovery using DNAseq and RNAseq from a single sample. The proposed computational tools will be integrated into software packages under common application framework adopted by the broad scientific community.

One explanation is that the molecular networks in which genes interact are wired differently across cell types within the organism. The purpose of this project is to identify the functional molecular networks in major cell and tissue types in two mammals, humans and mice. Using gene expression, or transcriptome, data with newly developed statistical inference methodologies, this research will uncover the connections currently obscured by the complex gene interaction patterns that result from the concurrent activity of many networks. There are rich 'omics data resources profiling these dynamic molecular rewiring processes, including the FANTOM5 promoter-level gene expression atlases of mammalian primary cells and tissues, and tissue-specific human and mouse epigenome profiles from the ENCODE project. Using these public data sets and innovative computational methods, the project is expected to decipher epigenetically rewired molecular networks across a number of types of tissues during differentiation. The resulting high-resolution networks can then be compared between the organisms, showing how functional networks have evolved between human and mouse. Therefore, the project is expected to be transformative in the understanding of complex biological mechanisms, implementing a strategy demonstrating the causality-by-functionality principle. <br/><br/>Network inference is becoming a bottleneck in modern biology as high-throughput data backlogs have surpassed the capacity of human interpretation. To address this challenge, the goal of this project is to design a nonparametric functional dependency framework for network inference using the causality-by-functionality principle, apply it in characterizing mammalian molecular networks, and evaluate the performance in a subnetwork underlying cerebellar development. With the latest excellent mammalian transcriptome and epigenome resources, the project will reveal combinatorial functional effects to understand causal molecular interactions, detect tissue-specific network rewiring in mammalian cell differentiation, characterize pathway evolution between human and mouse at the promoter level, and validate a three-layer inferred gene subnetwork for cerebellar development. The project outcomes are expected to include molecular networks involving transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and noncoding RNAs; second-order network rewiring across major cell and tissue types in mammalian cell differentiation; and pathway evolution between human and mouse in response to an ongoing debate on transcriptome divergence between the two species. The inferred cerebellar subnetwork after validation will contribute to new biology in brain development research. The network inference methodologies are expected to substantially expand the landscape of discoverable complex nonlinear interactions in dynamic networks, and the resulting software will be an essential informatics tool for discoveries in biology. Educational activities planned at New Mexico State University will enhance biological informatics workforce development and prepare students for knowledge-based career opportunities.

Surmounting significant challenges such as the ability of infectious agents to evolve resistance to drugs and the ability of crop pests to defeat a diverse array of increasingly powerful insecticides requires an understanding of the nature of adaptation. Recent advances have demonstrated that adaptation often occurs via ""soft selective sweeps,"" in which an adaptive genetic variant originates multiple times or has become favored only after it has been present at a substantial frequency in the population. This project contributes to advancing knowledge of the fundamental evolutionary process of adaptation by developing new computational tools to detect and study the occurrence of adaptation by soft selective sweeps. Through the interactions of a multidisciplinary team spanning evolutionary biology and bioinformatics, the project integrates advances in evolutionary simulation with modern and efficient computational methods in order to produce progress on understanding adaptation, while simultaneously developing efficient computational tools applicable in the modern ""big-data"" era of inexpensive sequencing. In addition, its joint mentorship efforts from evolutionary and bioinformatics perspectives promote interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. <br/><br/>The project has four objectives: (1) To design new tests for detecting selection in the case in which soft selective sweeps occur from standing genetic variation; (2) To identify haplotypes that carry a beneficial allele in genomic regions known to be experiencing positive selection; (3) To enhance new methods of analysis of natural selection to make them robust to confounding demographic scenarios; (4) To apply new selection methods in a series of data sets from multiple species, including humans, Drosophila, and Plasmodium malaria parasites. The project will use algorithmic techniques from combinatorial optimization and machine learning, and it will exploit ideas from population genetics and coalescent theory. It breaks ground on several fronts, providing a deeper understanding of the patterns in site-frequency spectra and haplotype data as a basis for selection signatures, and assisting in the design of subtyping studies for complex regions of the genome. As it becomes increasingly possible to sequence whole genomes of multiple individuals within a population, the intellectual challenge of designing tools for detecting selection to accommodate new phenomena such as soft sweeps coincides with the computational challenge of incorporating genomic data sets into selection studies. These challenges are addressed by the project, whose results will be available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/vbafna/research-2/nsf1458059/."

However, the analysis of NGS data remains a major obstacle to the efficient utilization of the technology. While substantial effort has been invested on the development of software dedicated to the individual analysis steps of NGS experiments, insufficient resources are currently available for integrating the individual software components into automated workflows capable of running the analysis of most types of NGS applications from start-to-finish in a time-efficient and reproducible manner. This Development project will address this need by enhancing systemPipeR, a popular R/Bioconductor software package. The project will have significant impact on a wide range of scientific communities and our society at large by allowing to translate NGS data into biologically relevant knowledge in a time-efficient and reproducible manner. This will accelerate many research and discovery projects in academia and industry, where NGS technologies play an important role. Extensive educational resources for interdisciplinary training at the intersect of genome and computational biology will be provided. Training will be offered to scientists, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students. Members of underrepresented groups will participate in all aspects of this project while supporting diversity. Extensive online tutorials will be provided to maximize the educational outreach of the activities. <br/><br/>The specific aims of this project are: (AIM 1) Enhancements to systemPipeR?s user interface and the workflow design framework will greatly simplify the process of running workflows, generating automated reports and designing new workflows. It will also improve user-friendliness to make systemPipeR equally useful for R and non-R users, as well as biologists without any expert knowledge in bioinformatics. The execution plan of this aim includes the design of a central workflow control user interface and the adaptation of new community standards to further increase the reproducibility of analysis workflows. (AIM 2) Automated analysis workflows will be developed for a wide range of additional NGS applications. Most of these workflows will be designed in collaboration with experts of the corresponding NGS application areas. Suggestions from the community will be incorporated as well. Sample templates will be provided for the supported NGS applications to create workflow instances with a single command fully populated with all input data and environment settings. (AIM 3) The project will also have a strong focus on community integration and performance evaluations provided by its current and future users. This includes options for users to contribute code or entire workflows, and extensive training of the target audience to analyze NGS data with systemPipeR and related resources.

The cell type identity is defined, at least in part, by the specific regions of the genome that are transcribed from DNA to RNA.  Transcription is the basic cellular process that creates the RNA intermediate that either codes for proteins, mRNAs, or regulates other processes, producing various non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Both types of transcript cell differentiation paths or cellular responses to environmental influences. RNA polymerases are the enzymes that produce RNA transcripts, such as mRNAs and ncRNAs, and they exist in cells either as molecules that are maintain their association with the DNA template or are released being transported away from the DNA and acted on by other cellular machinery. One complication to analyzing the transcription process is that genes can overlap, so the presence of a polymerase and a nascent RNA transcript might indicate activity of either gene using current methodologies. Since RNA transcripts have a high propensity to fold into three dimensional shapes they that can affect the downstream processes, both sequence and shape of the nascent RNA are important characteristics of nascent transcripts still associated with DNA as well as the RNA transcripts that are released from the DNA. Only recently have high throughput nascent transcription assays become available; these allow researchers to assess the activity of cellular polymerases directly. This project seeks to develop an integrated analysis framework for nascent transcription data.  Critically, changes in the shapes or levels of transcripts provide information as to how mutations, or other perturbations, have affected an RNA polymerase's functional properties.  Understanding the detailed molecular basis of transcription is critical to many research areas including biochemistry, molecular biology and computational biology. As such, careful attention will be paid to the development of educational and computational resources to support of the larger community. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop of an integrated framework for the interpretation and analysis of nascent transcription. This project leverages a mathematical model of RNA polymerase II that, when fit to nascent transcription data, quantitatively characterizes not only the levels but also the shapes of all transcripts genome-wide.   Specifically, this project has 4 overarching goals, as follows:  Leverage patterns of differential nascent transcription to identify overlapping transcripts; detection of overlapping transcription at regulatory regions like enhancers may provide insight into how such ncRNAs function. Capture termination of transcription within a principled mathematical model of polymerase behavior; the algorithm developed here will inform on the conflicting hypotheses about how transcription termination occurs. Identify the impact of technical choices, such as protocol selection and sequencing depth, on the detection and characterization of transcripts, thereby recommending best practice in nascent transcription studies. Enable broader adoption of nascent transcription analysis through construction of an educational module that supports the use of these computational tools; the module will encompass the software, websites, and user documentation.  In summary, the research proposed here will provide an unprecedented perspective on differences in transcription characteristics at individual genes and how perturbations affect them.  By quantifying alterations in transcription at individual genes and their magnitude, the end result of this project will be an integrated framework for the interpretation of nascent transcription.

The collection consists of more than 6,000 bacterial strains collected over a 40 year period from worldwide origins and habitats and represents a national treasure for microbiologists, educators, and professionals in agricultural and food industry.  Historically valuable microbial germplasm will be documented and preserved. The collection is a national resource for scientists in diverse disciplines and supports collaborative contemporary research on taxonomy, genomics, detection technology and forensic epidemiology. The collection's size, novelty, and diversity permits data analysis of well-characterized reference strains on a scale not previously possible.  This will be a valuable resource for identifying and characterizing microbes associated with diseased/compromised trade goods and will enhance educational and training opportunities for aspiring microbial taxonomists. Access to this large collection of strains from a centrally-located laboratory serves the national interest by enabling both industry and the non-profit biological research community to access selected strains at a minimal cost.<br/><br/>Bacterial strains will be revitalized, annotated and prepared for transfer to designated staff at Agdia, Inc., located in Indiana.  Purity of each culture will be confirmed, duplicates will be eliminated and data for each strain will be added to a unified and modernized database. The focus of this project will be on the transfer of strains that represent genetic bacterial diversity as determined by DNA sequence analysis of multiple bacterial genes, development of molecular diagnostic tests, and strains originally used in Hawaii to screen hybridoma cell lines for production of pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies.  Publications describing genetic characteristics and population diversity will be referenced in the database. Remaining strains will be organized, validated and documented over a three year period allowing total transfer of up to 6,000 strains. Creation of a modernized unified database, which includes relevant data for individual strains is a major undertaking that will enable researchers, students and regulatory personnel to make informed selections before requesting a culture. User fees for culturing, shipping and compliance with federal and state regulations will result in sustained support. The back-up storage of reference strains will ensure the long-term integrity of the collection and will serve as a valuable scientific resource. Characteristics of each strain are currently being organized into a database maintained at the University of Hawaii.  After the project is completed the data accompanying each culture will be transferred to Agdia, Inc. enabling public access (www.agdia.com)."

This project will provide access to digitized records of 15 plant families associated with adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments that can be used to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. This network will, for example, provide data that can be used to explore trait development and evolution, species delimitation, and geographic distribution modelling and that can inform national and regional floristic projects. This project will help provide critically needed information to overcome obstacles related to studying plant families which are very large, have cryptic diagnostic features, or occur in geographically challenging areas.

The analysis of such interactions is crucial for understanding signal transduction pathways that drive cell differentian during development and throughout the life an an organism. These pathways are often involed in disease progression, such as cancer, so a broader impact of understanding these pathways could be the design of drugs to modulate such pathways. Moreover, such an understanding of protein protein interactions may aid the develpment of protein-based biomaterials. Current technologies exist for providing a blueprint for large protein interaction networks, but a deeper understanding requires detailed structures of the complexes formed by protein pairs or partners. Structural information is frequently difficult or even impossible to obtain by experimental tools, emphasizing the need for computational approaches. Vajda and Kozakov at Boston University have developed the web based server ClusPro for predicting the three dimensional structures of protein-protein complexes. According to the worldwide experiment CAPRI (Critical Assessment of Predicted Interactions), ClusPro consistently has been the best protein-protein docking server. It has over 5000 registered users and performs around 3500 docking calculations each month. Structures generated by the server have been reported in over 350 research papers. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of ClusPro that will be able to optimally utilize the vast amount of data accumulated in public bioinformatics databases in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of the predicted structures. Since the server is used primarily by biological and chemical scientists who may not have expertise in the use of current bioinformatics tools, the new version will provide convenient access to state-of-art methods. Integration of bioinformatics and computational biophysics approaches, in combination with experimental validation, will result in a unique and powerful research tool.  The increased availability of protein complex structures will have a major impact in many areas of biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. All software developed will be released free of charge for academic and governmental use. In addition, the project will be used to train a new generation of graduate students, who will be able to optimally combine data from a variety of experimental and bioinformatics techniques with high performance computing. The use of the server will also be incorporated into undergraduate courses to teach aspects of bioinformatics and biophysical principles of molecular recognition.  <br/><br/>The current version of ClusPro systematically samples the conformational space of a target protein complex, and scores the structures using physics based energy functions. The major shortcoming of this approach is that it performs docking without consideration of the large body of interaction, sequence, structural, and experimental information available in public databases. Rather than simply generating and scoring docked structures of the starting proteins, the new approach will use their sequences to collect all orthologs to identify the globular domains and inter-domain regions that may contain short linear motifs (SLIMs). Domains that occur in a number of interacting protein pairs are likely to mediate the interaction, enabling the identification of the specific domains that interact with domains or SLIMs of the partner protein. Superimposing the domains from different orthologs identifies the conserved regions. Since the interface in complexes is sequentially and structurally more conserved relative to the rest of the protein, for the case of domain-domain interactions docking just the key segments generally yields near-native docked structures. Docking key segments from different orthologs and selecting consensus models improves the reliability of predicted structures. This approach substantially improves the docking of proteins that have flexible loops, and will be extended to the docking of homology models. If the interface includes a SLIM, docking structures of peptide fragments that contain the motif extends the method to proteins with interactions mediated by flexible or unstructured regions. The algorithms to be developed will be implemented in ClusPro, which will provide substantial new information on protein-protein complexes. ClustPro software can be accessed at http://cluspro.bu.edu."

The SAU collection of approximately 9,500 specimens represents thousands of species from across the US and Canada.  Through historical missionary work of SAU professors, specimens were also collected from international locations including Philippines, Kenya, Lebanon, and Abu Ghraib, Iraq.

In 2014, a languishing herbarium collection of ca. 9,500 specimens from Southern Adventist University (SAU) in Cleveland, Tennessee was transferred to UCHT.  After transfer, triage work revealed extensive damage from insects, failing glue, and improper storage.  However, it also revealed the national and international breadth of the collection.  Beyond North America, specimens were observed from Kenya, Lebanon, Philippines, and Iraq, potentially representing unique biological collections not present in other US collections.  This effort will support the post-transfer curation, repair, preservation, integration into UCHT, and digitization of the SAU collection.

This project will update the existing storage systems in the collection to ensure they are preserved for future research and education. In addition, specimen images and associated data will be stored in an online database freely available to the public. Training will be provided on proper preservation of entomological specimens and natural history collections to junior researchers, and undergraduate students, as well as underrepresented groups. This project will raise awareness of the importance of insects and natural history collections through various public engagement activities, aquatic ecosystem workshops, and rural community youth programs. <br/><br/>The PERC's holdings include the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), as well as several important historical collections, including damselflies and dragonflies (Odonata), aquatic beetles (Coleoptera), and North American bees (Hymenoptera). The PERC also serves as a repository for various Indiana Survey projects and other voucher material, and houses over 2,200 primary and secondary type specimens. Despite the importance of its holdings, the PERC has remained underutilized by, and in some cases inaccessible to, scientists, students, and water managers outside of Purdue. This project will address these problems by updating the curatorial standards and expanding the specimen database. Specific goals include transferring improperly stored specimens into modern drawers and cabinets, integration of recently collected specimens for molecular work, updating the current slide storage system, reorganizing and ethanol-preserved collections. PERC specimen data will be shared and made available online through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org); PERC's mayfly data will also be made available through the Mayfly Central website (www.entm.purdue.edu/mayfly/).

Organisms that are more closely related to each other have more similar genomes.  Often, an organism and its relatives live fairly nearby, so in principle genome similarity between many different organisms can be used to construct a map of the local geography.  In this map, distances correspond to how easy it is for the organism to travel; so the map will display the landscape ""as the organism sees it"".  Specifically, the methods developed here will construct these maps in a way to allow optimization of several different criteria, and will use randomized algorithms for pattern identification to allow efficient computation on large genomic datasets.  The other, related suite of methods will use emerging tools from geostatistics to place other individuals on these maps, with rigorously quantified uncertainty. <br/><br/>The description of geographic patterns from genomic data, and location of unknown samples, will have many applications.  These tools could be used to identify the origin of a newly invading parasite, or to identify key barriers dividing the range of an endangered species. They will be of interest for inferring ancestry, and might be used to locate, for instance, the likely home of a person's grandfather to within 100km or so. They can also be used to visualize the relationships between modern populations; for instance, of humans, whose modern distribution reflects a complex history of large- and small-scale migrations; or of other species for which we often know little about their migration ecology. The simple, interactive, animated graphics developed as part of this proposal will help give researchers a new way of displaying information<br/>and contribute to the field of next-generation data visualization. To further enable effective communication of genetic results, short workshops will be offered both locally and at national meetings, with the post-doctoral fellow and/or graduate students hired through this proposal taking a leading role. The resulting tools will be distributed and discussed at http://ralphlab.usc.edu/ and http://gcbias.org/."

Many of the responses in a cell are due to changes in what proteins are produced; cells turn on protein production, or turn it off, when a particular group of proteins, regulatory proteins, interact with the DNA. Regulatory proteins may act alone or in groups to turn genes on and off, and the timing and number of combinations in these binding events can be very complicated.  There are experiments that show where a specific protein attaches to the DNA, giving us clues that regulation might be occurring; with improving laboratory methods we are able to find the DNA binding locations (profiles) of more and more proteins very specifically. This research will develop special computational and statistical methods for analyzing all of this data together, so that we can see what combinations of proteins act together to regulate genes. From these results we will understand much more about how gene regulation is working in functioning cells. All products produced by this research will be made freely available and accessible to other researchers and the public. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to use these bioinformatics research techniques, and strong efforts will be made to recruit students from under-represented groups. Interesting exercises will be created, based on the research methods and results, for undergraduate bioinformatics students and for students in workshops, as well as lessons suitable for high school students studying genetic regulation in their biology courses. <br/><br/>Current bioinformatics analysis techniques do not fully capture the structural information provided by the shape of read distributions produced in high-resolution genomic assays. For example, careful analysis of cross-linking patterns in collections of ChIP-exo datasets can potentially inform which proteins are interacting with one another in higher-order protein-DNA complexes. This project aims to develop a suite of shape-aware machine-learning tools for the analysis of high-resolution protein-DNA binding data that will: 1) deconvolve distinct genomic interaction modes from a single dataset; 2) detect and correct experimental artifacts and biases that arise in the new assays; 3) characterize the organization of higher-order protein-DNA complexes across multiple data types; and 4) detect changes in genomic event locations and interaction modes across multiple experimental conditions. This project will therefore enable integrative models of diverse protein-DNA complexes, directly impacting our understanding of gene regulation in a wide variety of organisms."

The study of these host/symbiont systems is precluded by a lack of access to basic information and knowledge about their biology, including physical collections. Resulting from 50 years of fieldwork, the Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection (AAGC) at the University of Connecticut (UConn) is an unparalleled resource for studying complex systems of social insects. The AAGC comprises more than two million specimens of New World army ants and their associated guests:  Hundreds of species of mites, beetles, flies, wasps, springtails, and bristletails.  Extensive field notes and numerous photographs complement the biological specimens, detailing intricacies of species interactions. This project will stabilize this collection, addressing critical issues. This project aims to address basic physical storage issues and to make all data publicly available via an on-line database so as to maximize its potential as a source of information on social behavior in insects. A two-part exhibit will engage the campus community. One part will highlight the Rettenmeyers' collecting activities. Across campus, the second part will include a large ant model complete with an array of mites attached all to scale. <br/><br/>This project is motivated by the recent donation of the Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection (AAGC) to the UConn Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Biodiversity Research Collection Facility. The AAGC comprises more than 2 million specimens of New World army ants and their associated arthropods. It includes ca. 1,000 types representing 200 species, ca. 16,000 pinned specimens, ca. 5,000 microscope slides, more than 15,000 vials and jars, complemented by detailed field data and 5,000 Kodachrome transparencies. The collection is in dire need of stabilization - fluid levels are low, stoppers are deteriorating, specimens are overcrowded and disorganized. The project's two primary goals are specimen curation (e.g., replacing fluid, re-vialing, labeling, attaching barcodes, and reorganization) and establishing an on-line presence by modifying an existing MySQL database to accommodate the AAGC in four related Tables. Type specimens and colony exemplars will be image and linked to database records. Data will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.

The ability to detect and quantify the impact of these stressors on species communities is critical for maintaining and managing biodiversity and the health of ecosystems. The assessment of anthropogenic impacts on these species communities, however, is a challenging problem given the multivariate nature and multiple facets of biodiversity data. Species differ not only in their taxonomic identities but also in their abundances, evolutionary history, and their role and function in ecosystems. Predicting and understanding how species communities are altered by anthropogenic change and how novel communities function is key to sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem function. This project aims to develop a computational approach for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. The application of these tools to pressing ecological questions will generate much needed information regarding how biological communities are responding to multiple globally important anthropogenic stressors<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new computational methods that integrate multiple sources of biodiversity information to delineate constituent units within species assemblages (defined from here onwards as component communities) and quantify the impact of anthropogenic stressors. The project has two specific aims. The first is to integrate phylogenetic information with species interaction and composition data to identify component communities within ecological assemblages in heterogeneous biodiversity data. The second is to apply these integrative methods to diverse datasets to characterize the changes in composition of ecological assemblages based on responses of these component communities to anthropogenic stressors.

Understanding of biochemical and cellular processes has profited enormously from the development of high resolution fluorescence techniques. Total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy is a technique that allows high resolution imaging of a thin layer of the cell close to the plasma membrane and has become a standard technique to study membrane proteins. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) provides the capability to extract dynamics from single biological molecules in vitro and in cells yielding crucial insights into their inherently heterogeneous and complex nature. One of the primary limitations of these techniques is that they are highly labor intensive and thus have been primarily restricted for single sample analysis followed by costly manual data processing.  The proposed instrument will overcome these challenges by developing high throughput versions of both techniques under a single, cost-effective imaging and data collection platform. In addition, a new analysis package Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), to be developed by researchers and computer scientists,  will be open-source and made freely available online, providing an alternative to costly and proprietary imaging software that is often tied to a particular device.  Research enabled by this instrument spans the disciplines of chemistry, physics, molecular biology, and engineering to answer fundamental questions in biology.  The ability to perform multiple and single molecule studies at high throughput has the capacity to accelerate basic scientific discoveries essential to the biosciences.  The multidisciplinary nature of this project will also create unique training and educational opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral researchers.  <br/><br/>The ability to resolve structural rearrangements, biomolecular interactions, and binding kinetics of complex systems is essential to the research aims across multiple disciplines of study including biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. Imaging of fluorescent biomolecules in their natural cellular environment to obtain quantitative information about their dynamic behavior is essential for further understanding their roles in cellular processes.  The goal of this project is to develop a unique, versatile, and multi-faceted platform that will extend high temporal and spatial imaging for high throughput TIRF and FCS.  The instrument will be able to function in multiple high throughput modes and provide the tools to extract a broad range of biomolecular dynamics using ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence measurements in polymeric, reconstituted, or cellular systems.  Due to the multi-modal capabilities of the instrument, a new open-source fluorescence spectroscopy analysis package, Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), will be developed offering offers reusable software modules for processing of fluorescence spectroscopy data. The instrument will conduct high-throughput, high sensitivity studies in a cost-effective and user friendly format that has the potential to transform studies of biomolecular dynamics and allow the extension of TIRFM and FCS to applications previously inaccessible."

The extreme diversity and remoteness of tropical forests make research on their vulnerability to climate change particularly challenging because the work often requires sophisticated instrumentation that is not well suited to fieldwork. This award will support studies using custom-designed instrumentation to measure trace gases on botanical garden specimens to understand leaf physiology and the production of isoprene gas. Isoprene helps leaves tolerate heat and drought, both of which are expected to increase in tropical forests with climate change. Field datasets showing tree responses to recent climate warming (elevation range shifts), and droughts will also be analyzed.  As part of the effort, groups of 10th grade students will be mentored in biological research methods to promote broadening participation.<br/> <br/>The research aims of the planned study will address whether isoprene production impacts organismal resilience to climate change.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The research will study how migratory birds use a seasonal rainfall event, the North American Monsoon (NAM), for resources in their annual feather replacement.  Many species of birds that breed in Western North America use this monsoon as a region to replace their feathers, but where these birds come from, and how dependent they are on these monsoonal rains, is not well understood. Replacing feathers is important for birds, and all birds replace their feathers at least once a year. Migratory birds face the challenge of breeding, molting, and fueling for migration throughout the year. Breeding and migration have been well studied in these birds, but little research has been dedicated to molt. Furthermore, climate change is affecting the timing and intensity of the monsoon, and there is currently no data that can inform how this will affect the birds that use the monsoon for feather molt, and this study will combine analysis of the genomes of birds with a unique collection of specimens from this region to assess how birds use the monsoon for feather molt. <br/><br/>To understand how various populations employ this strategy, the fellow will establish the migratory connectivity of birds using this region to molt by constructing a reference database of genomic DNA from breeding populations of 13 species of birds that are known to follow this molt migration strategy, then sequencing DNA from molting birds in the NAM region. These data will allow the fellow to understand the relative proportions of breeding populations using this molt-migration strategy. The fellow will also investigate how the NAM has influenced molt phenology and plasticity of molt timing and location by conducting this migratory connectivity analysis in two species of common molt-migrants across a time series spanning 80 years from a heritage collection at Occidental College. Occidental College houses the largest collection of birds from Mexico in the world, and is active in development and use of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) for phylogenetic and population inference; and is the ideal setting for this research. The fellow will be trained in field and laboratory techniques in specimen preparation and DNA extraction, as well as mentoring and publication skills, and specimen curatorial and data analysis."

A significant part of this transcription involves long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs). LncRNAs are known to function as RNA genes and are involved in various biological and cellular processes, such as genetic imprinting, chromatin remodeling, gene regulation in both plants and animals, and embryonic development in vertebrates. Not surprisingly, LncRNAs have been implicated in several difficult diseases, such as cancer, and diabetes. Although some individual LncRNAs have been well studied, their nature and functions are still not completely understood. Over 30,000 have been identified, with this number increasing daily. Thus, our ability to experimentally study individual LncRNAs and their functions in the wet-lab is far outpaced by the sheer volume and diversity of available data, and the increasing rate at which the data is being generated. There is an acute need for computational tools to simplify the process of characterizing the known LncRNAs to determine their functional associations. Yet, automated methods will undoubtedly generate an enormous number of hypotheses on the potential functions of a given lncRNA, far beyond the capacity of any individual wet laboratory to verify. This calls for a collaborative community-driven approach, where researchers from various fields will come together to address a critical problem. Several workshops will be organized, bringing together researchers interested in prioritizing issues of importance to furthering research in this area.<br/><br/>The aim of these workshop activities is to build a diverse community of scholars centered on the problem of functional annotation of LncRNAs, including LncRNA detection and data generation, and standardization of lncRNA nomenclature. Such a community will bring together computational scientists, molecular and structural biologists, medical scientists, and others, from academia,government, industry (especially healthcare and pharmaceutical industry), to focus on key issues in our improved understanding of LncRNAs and their functions. By creating public forums of the outcomes of discussions and activities, these workshops will raise awareness on key problems and challenges in studying the biology of in LncRNAs, their functions, and information sharing challenges such as annotation, and nomenclature standardization. A highly diverse community of researchers will be encouraged to participate, who could provide a novel perspective to these problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, mutations occur upon exposure to sun in the genome of skin cells that can ultimately lead to the development of skin cancer. Mutations range in size from single base pair alterations to massive insertions and deletions that can span over a million base pairs. The best understood mutations are those that involve alteration, insertion, or deletion of a single base pair, where there are numerous tools for identifying and validating such changes. Yet in many organisms, it is increasingly appreciated that large, even massive, insertions of DNA can occur from other organisms, termed lateral gene transfer, that have the potential to have a profound effect on the organism, either detrimental or beneficial. For example, large insertional mutations led to the transition of endosymbionts to organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts. This project seeks to improve tools previously developed to identify such lateral gene transfers from genome sequencing data, and to make these tools available to the research community after ensuring that they are more robust and user friendly. The team has already used these tools to identify integration of bacterial DNA into numerous animal genomes, including into human somatic cell genomes of individuals with cancer, where such mutations may be oncogenic. Making the tools available to more scientists should increase the understanding of the occurrence and importance of such mutations in all organisms. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop YouTube whiteboard videos to educate the general public about these mutations, genomics, and the tools developed in this proposal. The first of these videos can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZG4qjVjJ70.<br/><br/>Lateral gene transfer (LGT, synonymous with horizontal gene transfer or HGT) is the movement of DNA between diverse organisms. It is one form of insertional mutagenesis and can be advantageous or deleterious. In bacteria, LGT has been implicated in antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and bioremediation. While the greatest focus has been on bacteria, it has become increasingly clear that it occurs in eukaryotes as well. For example, our research focuses on interdomain LGT between bacteria and Metazoans, which is increasingly described. This has led to the hypothesis that that LGT may have contributed more to the evolution of phenotypes in eukaryotes than previously assumed. However, there continue to be barriers to detecting LGT, particularly in Metazoan genomes. The goal of this project is to develop a bioinformatics resource in the form of a virtual machine to aid in the detection of LGT. This tool can be used to detect LGT between any suspected donor-recipient pair, including endosymbiont-host and organelle-host pairs as well as organelle-organelle, bacteria-bacteria, and viral-host, to name just a few. Such a tool could also be used by metagenomics researchers teasing apart LGT from assembly artifacts, geneticists trying to identify the integration site of a transposon following a selective screen, and for identification of integration sites for known mobile elements. Essentially, this tool can be used to detect the integration of novel DNA in any genome with some knowledge about the donor and/or recipient genome. Most sequence analysis tools have focused on SNPs or small insertions/deletions. The development of bioinformatics tools to detect larger insertions is an area that has been under-served and currently lacks robust bioinformatics tools. This proposal aims to meet those needs. Ongoing results of the project can be found at: http://lgt.igs.umaryland.edu/nsf_abi."

The instrument is to be housed at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center, an established analytical laboratory performing mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis at Kansas State University. The mass spectrometer acquisition will directly impact and advance the training of postdoctoral trainees, graduate students, and undergraduates. Early-career faculty and faculty at primarily undergraduate institutions will benefit from access to state-of-the-art lipid analysis. Undergraduates learning and using mass spectrometry will include students at Kansas State University, including participants in the McNair and other undergraduate scholars? programs, and from historically black Fayetteville State University. Training will include an annual workshop on mass spectrometry-based lipid analysis (lipidomics) for faculty and trainees and a research club focused on analysis and interpretation of lipidomics data on crop species.  Lipidomics has not reached its ultimate potential as an analytical tool, because the methods, materials, and computational resources to effectively carry out lipid profiling, particularly for plant lipids, are not conveniently available. Thus, Kansas Lipidomics Research Center personnel will aid scientists who wish to implement lipidomics analyses at their institutions by providing consultation, protocols for sample preparation, plug-and-play mass spectral methods, internal standards, and data processing systems, resulting in data suitable for upload to and analysis at a publicly available database. Knowledge obtained through use of the acquired mass spectrometer will be applied to improve food, industry, and energy applications in major crops including sorghum, camelina, and wheat.<br/><br/>The acquired Sciex 6500+ mass spectrometer with accessories will provide improved definition of lipid structure while maintaining high sample throughput. The ion mobility spectrometry accessory will improve ability to specify lipid structural features without slowing the analytical work flow, compared to current technologies. The improved lipid structural specificity will provide scientists with the ability to unambiguously assign specific lipids to metabolic maps, connecting quantitative and structural information on plant lipids directly with genes and enzymes, thus transforming our understanding of lipid metabolic pathways in model and crop plants. The mass spectrometer acquisition will deliver critical capabilities for the projects of researchers from fifteen laboratories. Additionally, the mass spectrometer will be made available to new users as well as past and current Kansas Lipidomics Research Center analytical users. Projects will use the high structural definition provided by the Sciex 6500+ with ion mobility spectrometry to link the lipidome accurately with plant genomes and phenomes, while investigating the roles of lipids and the functions of lipid metabolizing and signaling gene products in plants. Lipids will be analyzed in genome wide association studies, and other large-scale studies of genetically variant plant populations, identifying candidate genes putatively functioning in lipid metabolism and signaling during plant stress responses. Other projects will biochemically and functionally characterize lipid metabolic events that occur during plant responses to stress and during growth and development. The new instrument also will advance the work of scientists modifying plant seed oil composition for increased yield and quality. Thus, the acquired mass spectrometer will facilitate food, industrial, and energy crop improvement."

In Europe, The Human Brain Project is focused on accelerating brain research by integrating data available from a multitude of disparate research projects through the development of a multi-scale, multi-level model of the human brain - the 100 billion neurons modelling and simulation challenge. In the US, The Brain Initiative aims to reconstruct the full record of neural activity across complete neural circuits - the 100 billion neurons recording challenge. These are clearly huge, but worthy challenges that can benefit from an understanding of the principles of neural computation of much smaller yet sufficiently complex brains. The fruit fly brain has become one of the most popular model organisms to study neural computation and for relating brain structure to function. Many of the genes and proteins expressed in the mammalian brain are also conserved in the genome of the fruit fly. Remarkably, the fruit fly is capable of a host of complex nonreactive behaviors that are governed by a brain containing only ~100,000 neurons. The relationship between the fly's brain and its behaviors can be experimentally probed using a powerful toolkit of genetic techniques for manipulation of the fly's neural circuitry. Novel experimental methods for precise recordings of the fly's neuronal responses to stimuli and for mapping neurons and synapses in Drosophila nervous system have provided access to an immense amount of valuable data regarding the fly's neural connectivity map and its processing of sensory stimuli. These features coupled with the growing ethical and economic pressures to reduce the use of mammals in research, explain the growing interest in Drosophila-based brain models, not only to understand sensing, perception and neural computation, but also to gain mechanistic insights that may inform our efforts to address neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, in humans. <br/><br/>This project aims to design, implement and experimentally evaluate a potentially transformative open-source fly brain simulation platform capable of simulating ~135,000 neurons that make up the adult Drosophila brain. This computational infrastructure will be based on the recently established Graphic Processor Units (GPU)-enabled Neurokernel software platform. The modular simulation platform will integrate all knowledge about the Drosophila brain as a set of interconnected simulation modules which describe the operation of about 41 Local Processing Units (LPUs), six hubs and their interconnections, partly elucidated by detailed EM imaging studies. The simulation platform will be used to develop and validate a first draft model that incorporates the most advanced biophysical and/or functional models of the neurons and the latest published synaptic connections maps. The main focus will be on developing detailed models of the early visual system (retina, lamina, medulla) and of the early olfactory system (OSNs, antennal lobe, mushroom body, lateral horn). These models will integrate complete models of the visual and olfactory systems. The brain simulation platform will enable for the first time the isolated and integrated emulation of fly brain model neural circuits and their connectivity patterns (e.g., sensory and locomotion systems) and other parts of the fly's nervous system on clusters of GPUs. Using the Neurokernel simulation platform it will be possible to generate data sufficiently fast to enable researchers to compare and tune the input-output characteristics of virtual neurons on-line, while the experiment is running."

Marine organisms are being physiologically challenged by these environmental changes across their life stages, which then impacts their performance and survival, and ultimately endangering overall ecosystem balance. Such changes are particularly pronounced in very productive, high-latitude marine systems where many organisms are often finely tuned to their specific environment.  Hence, there is a great need to better monitor and understand the changes, the rates of changes, and how these changes affect the marine organisms. This project specifically improves the ability to accurately characterize the current physical and chemical ocean environment with state-of-the-art oceanic sensors, and the ability to test the response of marine organisms to future environmental changes with an innovative ocean change experimental system (OCES). The location of this project is the Kasitsna Bay Laboratory (https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/about-us/locations/kasitsna-bay/) and the surrounding waters of Kachemak Bay, in south-central Alaska. The region is valued for its diverse marine habitat types and rich marine life, which support extensive marine fisheries and subsistence harvests. Results of this study are, therefore, highly valuable for local stakeholders but results also are transferable to stakeholders in other high-latitude systems. Through the association with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the environmental data collection and the experiments that can be done with the OCES add to the education of a new generation of scientists. The public and general research community is informed of these data and research possibilities through outreach activities and presentations at various scientific and public forums, on websites, social media, and through workshops. These data are available for the broader public through publicly available databases (e.g., the Alaska Ocean Observing System, the Alaska Ocean Acidification Network).<br/><br/>The project uses a series of instruments that are deployed in the ocean along a glacial gradient to measure ocean acidity (pH), temperature, salinity, and oxygen. These measurements are done at high resolution, every few hours, to characterize the present environmental conditions with the inherent short-term changes based on tidal cycles and daily weather conditions. In addition, the project includes an OCES laboratory system, where the current conditions can be manipulated into future ocean scenarios, including altering ocean acidification, temperature, salinity, and oxygen.  This allows for the testing of the responses of individual organisms of interest, such as in their development, growth rates, metabolic rates, etc., under predicted future ocean conditions with comparison to measurements under current conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The funding will alleviate pressure for storage space within this collection located on the Pickle Research Campus of UT.  Transfer of specimens from the main campus has stressed the capacity of current storage to critical levels that significantly hinder access and specimen retrieval. Direct user access is vital to ensure that materials remain easily available for on-going and future research, education, and public outreach. This project will address many of these issues. It will facilitate cabinet upgrades, specimen security, and expanded digital access to irreplaceable fossil collections, especially those currently housed without climate control. Specimens include rare historic material, extirpated or extinct species, collections from now inaccessible localities, fossils from the geologic mapping of Texas, thesis and dissertation samples, paleobotanical collections, a unique Holocene marine, land snail and mussel collection, a genotypic mollusc collection, and several orphaned collections. New archival cabinets will provide more efficient space usage, and are a vital step in the progression to fully compacted climate-controlled space when additional funding permits. The physical structure of the cabinets combined with climate curtaining will prevent contamination by pests and pollution, buffer swings in temperature and humidity, and improve security. Public interest and education, furthered through innovative web and mobile applications, will be expanded through a variety of social media. <br/><br/>During the project implementation, most specimens will be passed through a freeze/thaw cycle to kill insects and larvae prior to their transfer to new cabinets. All transfer activity will be tracked via a linked geographic information system (GIS) to a database (Specify6) and web interface; collections will remain digitally accessible during the project by leveraging whole-drawer imagery, which could not be achieved without the previous deployments of an effective GIS and imaging as part of the ongoing inventory process. The project continues an institutional strategy to conserve important collections in the repository and to make high resolution 2-D, and now 3-D, digital surrogates available for collaborative research. All specimens will be imaged in full-drawer context, and individual specimens captured with their historic labels as an added resource. Refinement of the web connectivity between repository map, database, and images will enable remote access for potential teaching specimens and research resources. Virtual specimens and related data will be available for query and download, retaining flexibility to explore these off-site collections in a variety of contexts, including taxonomy, geology, and global paleogeography. Locality coordinates, corrected for plate tectonic movement, will be provided for both spatial and temporal analysis of data. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public."

This record is particularly important for ecosystems whose species are underrepresented in biological research collections, and therefore less understood.  Among such ecosystems within the continental United States are the Central Plains and the Southwestern Deserts.  The collections at Midwestern State University (MSU) in Wichita Falls, Texas holds a robust sample of specimens from the Rolling Plains ecosystem and the Chihuahuan Desert of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion. These collections are currently maintained as three taxonomically separated entities. By consolidating the vertebrate, terrestrial invertebrate, and plant collections at MSU into the Xeric Ecosystem Research Center (XERC), modernizing the infrastructure, and digitizing specimen data, the collection will become much more useful and accessible to scientists and members of the public.  XERC will also, through outreach programs and special museum exhibits, increase the understanding and appreciation of xeric ecosystem biodiversity among young learners and highlight the historical significance of plants and animals to the Native Americans who once occupied these ecosystems.  <br/><br/>The Xeric Ecosystem Research Center will consolodate all specimens currently in natural history collections at Midwestern State University.  Many of these specimen records were historically maintained as paper documents that will now be digitized by student assistants and citizen scientists, validated by curators, and made available to the public through iDigBio (http://www.idigbio.org). Herbarium specimens will be photographed and digitized to create a virtual herbarium that will also be publicly accessible.  Specimen cabinets will be repaired and upgraded to industry standards, the capacity to maintain molecular data will be enhanced with upgraded environmental storage, and an integrated pest management plan will be instituted.  Midwestern State will actively promote XERC to the broader scientific community and encourage broad use of the specimens and data contained therein. To enhance the educational and cultural value of XERC, an ADA accessible website and associated educational materials aimed at young learners (K-5) will be produced and made widely available. XERC will partner with the Wichita Falls Museum of Art (WFMA) to produce two public exhibits that highlights biodiversity of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion of Texas and the cultural significance of plants and animals of the Central Plains to early Native Americans. Through these efforts, the Xeric Ecosystem Research Center will serve as a hub for research, a record of biodiversity, and a repository for important biological materials from xeric ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research examines how temperature change affects bacteria that live within the gut of a desert ant. Many animal guts contain bacteria that aid in digestion, but the bacteria within Cephalotes rohweri (the Arizona turtle ant) are unusual in two important ways 1) the bacteria help the ant acquire Nitrogen, a key nutrient in growth and development, and 2) the bacteria survive extremely hot temperatures. The fellow will perform several experiments to determine if this bacterial community provides benefits to its ant host despite extreme heat exposure. The research improves scientific understanding of how animals can cope with a changing environment through shifts in their bacterial partners. The research broadly informs current industrial and commercial efforts to manipulate bacteria associated with animals and plants to improve food production. As a part of this research the fellow will develop a set of software tools to enable visually impaired scientists to interact with data through the sense of touch. <br/><br/>The fellow will 1) observe variation in gut bacterial composition between turtle ant colonies along a natural temperature gradient using 16s sequencing, 2) perform a growth chamber experiment; manipulating nest temperature and measuring response variables of gut bacterial composition and nitrogen acquisition from heavy isotope labeled urea, and 3) transplant gut bacteria into temperature naive ants; isolating the effect of microbe-based phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature.  This research will test the hypothesis that shifts in bacterial symbionts facilitate acclimation to novel temperature conditions in this desert ant species. This particular mechanism of phenotypic plasticity is poorly understood, but given the ubiquity of bacterial symbioses across plants and animals, shifts in symbiont composition may be important in determining the outcome of environmental change in a wide array of species. The project broadens participation of people with vision impairments by extending the functionality of a common scientific data analysis platform, R, to interface with 3-D printers, braille printers, and several commercially developed assistive technologies. The fellow will benefit from training in genetic data analysis and software development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy reliability is crucial to this infrastructure. The James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve is one of 39 closely connected reserves in the University of California Natural Reserve system (http://www.jamesreserve.edu/), and its location precludes use of conventional power. Nevertheless the James Reserve is committed to advancing the nation's capacity to support basic research and to sharing its resources with a diverse group of faculty, students, staff and the public. Power from solar energy fuels typical daily operations at the James Reserve. Requested funds will increase the battery bank to maximize the storage of solar energy that is harvested from existing solar panels, which will increase accessibility of the reserve. In addition to enhancing research, increased power will facilitate extended visits from classes of students. Many student visitors are from a diversity of urban, underrepresented and underserved populations in Southern California who have never had a firsthand look at winter snowpack. Understanding the connection between snowpack and drought is fundamental for scientists and citizens alike. <br/><br/>Installation of photovoltaic batteries and a separate power system for the weather station will improve its reliability, particularly in winter months when it is currently prone to power failure. This will improve availability of meteorological data. Increasing solar power storage will permit year-round access. Other minor improvements will stabilize power to scientific equipment and communications to increase research potential and improve safety. Strengthening the infrastructure at the James Reserve will enable longitudinal projects to become established as well as advance the capacity for future research programs. The majority of new research programs at the James are focused on the effects of shifting environmental conditions. Access to the James is crucial to support a new cohort of principal investigators who collect data during winter months, the season during which California receives most of its precipitation. The James Reserve is a particularly important field site for many projects because it is the only field station located in the San Jacinto Mountains of Southern California, an ecologically important area. The San Jacinto Mountains are a relatively humid sky island surrounded by desert; they represent a unique northern and inland region of the Peninsular Mountain Ranges. The James Reserve and surrounding region are vital for further research because of its baseline abiotic and biotic data that extend back to the early 1900's."

Their dried, pressed specimens are of multidimensional importance: they are documentation of plant occurrence through space and time; markers of taxonomic and nomenclatural identity; evidence of plant-animal interactions; and sources of DNA for molecular studies. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the acknowledgement of the importance of natural history specimens to modern biological research. Despite this resurgence and broad application of specimens in research a number of herbaria in Louisiana have recently closed and the collections orphaned. The Shirley C. Tucker Herbarium at Louisiana State University (LSU) has been the recipient of a large portion of these orphaned collections.  This has resulted in a near doubling in the size of the collection, from 207,500 specimens in 2015 to an estimated 400,000.  This project will result in the integration and consolidation of these specimens into the Tucker Herbarium's infrastructure, as well as completion of prior digitization efforts.

Challenges related to the integration of different filing schemes and database structures will be addressed by project personnel and their solutions will be presented at national conferences.  Additionally, continued digitization efforts will result in a nearly complete online database with image records of the Louisiana flora.  All associated data will be publicly accessible and linked to multiple consortium and data aggregation efforts, including SERNEC, iDigBio, and GBIF.

The AMNH has one of the largest primate collections in the world, including over 10,000 specimens collected on dozens of museum expeditions to South America, Africa, and Asia.  The AMNH collection preserves host specimens from large field surveys of scientifically important microbes and parasites and is an archive of biological diversity in many formerly pristine landscapes subsequently altered by human activities.  This collection is a national resource for training undergraduate, graduate-student, and postdoctoral researchers from the United States and abroad.   Primates are also studied by anthropologists for clues about human evolution, and primate research is also important for understanding the origins of human diseases (like AIDS and malaria), which are caused by microbes that evolved in monkeys and apes.  Additionally, the collection is often used as a basis for illustrations in field guides used by the public.  Specimens for public exhibits are viewed by millions of museum-goers every year. <br/><br/>This award will contribute to the long-term research and societal value of the AMNH primate collection by protecting vulnerable specimens on archival substrates in new dust- and insect-proof cabinetry, cleaning and repairing specimens, decompressing and reorganizing the collection, georeferencing, and improving data quality.  Currently, much of this collection is stored in old cabinets, where skins are discolored by dust and urban soot and at risk from insect pests.  AMNH houses one of the largest and most heavily used mammal collections in the world. On average, more than 200 unaffiliated researchers visit the AMNH mammal collection every year, the AMNH Department of Mammalogy loans about 1800 specimens annually to researchers at other institutions, and an online collection database provides access to specimen data.  Primates comprise a uniquely important part of the mammal collection.  Primate researchers account for more than 40 percent of total visitor activity in the Department of Mammalogy and account for a substantial fraction of publications based on AMNH mammals. Traditional museum research with this material has produced hundreds of scientific publications over the last 100 years, and new technologies (such as CT scanning and 3D laser-imaging) allow modern researchers to use AMNH primate specimens for a wide range of non-traditional research purposes.  A professionally produced video posted on the AMNH main website and its YouTube channel (the latter with more than 41,000 subscribers and millions of annual visitors) will serve to educate viewers about these important functions and about the challenges of museum specimen conservation."

Despite the research value, some of these collections are in distress due to lack of local institutional support.  One approach for raising awareness and support for the research and education value of campus collections is a student-led Natural History Collections Club (NHCC).  Since 2013, several clubs have formed based on the NHCC model to train the next generation of undergraduate students in biological collections methods and management; and to raise awareness, increase scientific and educational use, of their campus natural history collections.  These clubs collectively form the Natural History Collections Club Network (NHCCN). The Network has hosted workshops at international and regional meetings to encourage other groups to take up the NHCC model on their campuses and to start a student club and become part of the NHCCN. Through this award, workshop activities are planned that recruit and educate interested students and faculty advisors to develop a NHCC, strengthen the existing network, and support participation in existing NHCCs. <br/><br/>A 2019 workshop will take place during a full day of the annual meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC), which meets May 26-31.  The workshop agenda includes training and discussion on topics such as natural history collections documentation, specimen digitization, and experiential learning. Invitations for workshops will target institutions that may benefit most from joining the NHCCN, such as those that have expressed interest in improving student involvement in collections, particularly institutions with small collections and institutions with minority-serving emphases such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Universities with small natural history collections often contain many records of their surrounding ecosystems not duplicated in larger facilities and therefore provide unique representation of biological diversity to national and global data resources. The support provided through this award represents a cost-efficient way to ensure the maintenance, expansion, and data sharing of participating collections by involving students and recruiting participants from small collections that are committed to the success and sustainability of those collections.  A link to the workshop announcement is available on the web (https://www.idigbio.org/content/spnhc-travel-grants-nhccn).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jeana Drake is 'Coral skeleton protein evolution: Using ancient and modern skeletal protein data to elucidate coral evolutionary patterns'. The host institution for this fellowship is the University of California, Los Angeles, and the sponsoring scientist is David Jacobs.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop and test evolutionary models of proteins in corals, and how evolution of these proteins relates to climate change over the past 250 million years. The Fellow is using fossil coral collections from the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary periods, from the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution, and gene sequence data from modern corals housed in university and private aquaria, to study the evolution of coral biomineralization proteins. After employing standard geochemical analyses to confirm the pristine nature of fossil coral specimens, the Fellow is using mass spectrometry to sequence fossil proteins from corals that lived just before or after dramatic climate shifts in the last 250 million years. She is also developing constant evolutionary rate models based on gene sequences from modern corals within the same families as the fossil coral specimens. Finally, the Fellow is testing the validity of these evolutionary rate models using the fossil protein sequences. The Fellow's research examines the evolutionary patterns of corals across climate change events, and will clarify the robustness versus plasticity of individual coral biomineralization proteins.<br/><br/>The Fellow is furthering her skills in geochemistry, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, and managing a research project within a multidisciplinary setting. The Fellow is training undergraduate and graduate students in laboratory methods as well as preparation of manuscripts, posters and presentations. She is doing outreach at a local high school to share research concepts and outcomes with students and to include highly motivated students in laboratory work."

The project partners with the Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis (MAM) TCN, which is focused on generating and making available digital images of herbarium specimens from the urban corridor of the Mid-Atlantic states. The PAC collection spans over 100 years, from the early 1800s to the present, largely representing the flora of forested and agricultural landscapes west of the Susquehanna River and thus, can serve as a contextual counterpoint to plant assemblages in the MAM urban corridor. Its richness, both in time and space, will present a more complete picture of plant communities within the Mid-Atlantic Region and will contribute to the regional knowledge base.  These records will, in turn, contribute to active research initiatives in biology, horticulture and environmental management at Penn State and within the larger regional botanical community.  This project will fill critical gaps in knowledge of plant communities in urban environments of the Mid-Atlantic Region by providing key information on plant diversity in non-urban landscapes.  It also serves to train the next generation of botanists through experiential learning in state-of-the-art digitization and databasing techniques, make important components of the collection accessible to a broad array of researchers within the region and beyond, and engage both students and faculty as well as the local community in herbarium programs and activities.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to generate and distribute, through partnering with the ongoing Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis TCN, high-resolution digital images of the collection of vascular plant specimens at the PAC Herbarium.  The project will perform high resolution photographic imaging, transcription, georeferencing, and web publishing of approximately 64,000 vascular plant herbarium specimens of Pennsylvania, filling an important gap in digital data that is currently lacking from online databases.  Detailed information on plant communities across different landscapes, which will be enriched by the contributions from the PAC collection, will inform research on the factors that determine plant establishment, sustainability and invasibility in urban environments characterized by the MAM urban corridor. This project will also contribute to the wealth of vascular plant data currently available to botanists across the country and abroad through the iDigBio and UrBioNet portals.  We will recruit and train undergraduate students and local volunteers in digitization protocols, transcription of herbarium labels, and georeferencing through a series of Digithons. PAC staff and interns will also participate in the mini urban research symposium hosted by the MAM TCN and held at Rutgers University. Interns will be encouraged to attend the mini symposium to interact with scientists in the field of urban research and gain valuable experience in research protocols.

Two well-studied intracellular bacterial pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (Mtb) and Legionella pneumophila (Lp), known to induce dramatic organellar changes in host cells they infect, will be used to test the framework. Accurately characterizing the spatio-temporal evolution of the organellar changes in a large collection of time-lapse videos from different genetic mutants and controls will provide significant insight into the host response as a function of the specific stimulus. This can have a positive impact on large-scale genotype-phenotype association studies and the efficient screening of large genomic libraries. The analytical framework will be implemented using open source tools and integrated with standard tools available to the imaging community, thus increasing the accessibility of these tools and the transparency of the analysis. Open source development will facilitate enrichment of undergraduate education, through synergies with an NSF and Department of Defense funded REU program, TECBio. <br/><br/>The problem of isolating and tracking spatiotemporal changes in individual organelles is extremely challenging, subject to significant sources of noise and variability under many possible conditions. This project relies on a novel approach of considering subcellular components as vertices in a social network. Ensembles of cellular machinery will be characterized as networks to study organellar response to stimuli within the framework of interconnected elements whose collective behavior influence local and global social network topologies. The team will develop spectral graph analytics to characterize global network evolution and identify local dynamics, thus providing powerful algorithmic tools for isolating cohesive regions of subcellular evolution. This framework will be designed from the ground up to be highly scalable, capable of processing arbitrary amounts of high-resolution 4D confocal microscopy image data. Open-source, distributed software for ""big data"" analysis, such as Apache Spark and Hadoop, will be used to build the framework.

The technologies used to study proteins on a large scale are collectively called proteomics. The main method used in proteomics is mass spectrometry (MS), which can calculate the molecular weight and abundance of molecules. The majority of proteomics workflows perform a step of protein digestion prior to MS. The result of digestion is that all the proteins become broken up into small chains, called peptides. This step has become common, because peptides are easier to analyse by MS, due to their lower mass, producing simpler data to interpret. One challenge in this digestion step is that some proteins break down quickly whereas for others digestion is incomplete, producing unreliable quantification data that are not fully understood or compensated for by current analysis software. To overcome this problem, the University of Texas Anderson Cancer Center will collaborate with the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom to develop an integrated suite of analysis techniques using a powerful statistical technique called Bayesian modelling. These advances will be incorporated into a freely available software suite.<br/>  <br/>Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the primary technique used in proteomics. The most common approach is LC separation of tryptic fragments derived from a proteome digestion, followed by tandem MS of the peptides. This entire workflow is conceived as a series of discrete steps, some chemical, some instrumental, some informatics and some statistical. Existing software concentrates on subcomponents of the workflow, and comprise a series of deterministic, self-contained steps. This project will translate the whole protein quantification pipeline into a rigorous statistical framework underpinned by Bayesian methodology. The new framework will integrate evidence across all experimentally acquired datasets, and borrow strength from unused structure within a proteomics workflow, including digestion dynamics. The proposed pipeline consists of three synergistic developments (1) Utilization of all unidentified (peptide) features, as well as identified features, to infer the most likely mixture of proteins present in a sample; (2) Differential quantification of complex mixtures of known proteoforms; (3) Discovery of unknown proteoforms and all modifications (PTMs) carried by their quantification signatures. These advancements will elicit a step-change in quantification sensitivity and interpretation at the proteoform level for the first time. The end-to-end analysis solution will be made available within the user-centric standards compliant ProteoSuite package, and as a Galaxy workflow for high-throughput pipelines."

The ability to visualize, measure, and test the understanding of the movements and spatial distributions of animals in real time and space is especially important at a time of rapid environmental change, with altered habitats and seasonal patterns and important consequences for organisms and ecosystems. Performing experiments that mimic natural conditions and interactions with built-in repetition can demonstrate patterns and evaluate predictions to a very high standard of scientific rigor. This new stream system will allow this level of repetition in multiple stream channels to document the behavior of stream organisms like fish, crayfish, snakes and their food very precisely. The behavior and distributions of these and other stream organisms determines whether certain populations that may be important for ecosystem function or recreational use will survive or perhaps spread beyond their present limits and displace native species. Knowing how these organisms fare when faced with natural and human-caused disturbances like floods, droughts, chemical pollutants, and sedimentation requires just this kind of facility to obtain clear answers. This work involves a close connection with students in local schools, who in some cases will be able to participate directly in these studies or can watch behavior of animals in the stream system from their classrooms. <br/><br/>This project builds on the emergence of the Ecological Research and Education Center (EREC) field station at the University of Kentucky (see http://darwin.uky.edu/~erec/) by incorporating enhanced analytical capabilities through the construction of a new facility. The goals are to accelerate the development of research programs already associated with the station and its field research area ERF (= Ecological Research Facility) and to attract additional productive researchers and strengthen links with other universities, colleges, and K-12 schools in the region. An artificial stream system will be constructed with remote-controlled video that will be flexible enough to accommodate a diversity of questions and focal organisms and will allow control over physical conditions essential to mimicking the corresponding natural environments. The system will have enough independent streams to allow two or even three studies to run simultaneously at modest levels of replication or one study at high replication. The video tracking, controlled for position and zoom from off-site, can transmit high-resolution video from one or all 10 cameras to a single video screen for real-time day/night observation, storage, and analysis. A computer linked to the system by an underground fiber-optic cable will enable visualization of behavior in the streams in real time, store the large amount of data generated, and facilitate data analysis and sharing with collaborators, schools, and other researchers. This combination of capabilities will allow rapid advances in our understanding of the under-studied animals and ecosystems of streams, a high priority in Kentucky's stream-rich landscapes."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Understanding the environmental factors that allow species to survive in various environments is an important goal of ecologists. Knowledge gained from such work can be used to explain patterns of biodiversity, predict how species will respond to changing environments, and enable society to make informed decisions about conservation and management. Temperature is a prevalent factor that determines aspects of life for ectotherms, i.e., animals that cannot produce their own body heat. For example, an insect living underneath a leaf in a shady tree may experience temperatures that are much cooler compared to the surrounding air. How does this ""micro-scale"" temperature change from leaf to leaf? How does it affect the growth and survival of the insect? How does it affect the interactions between the insect and others? These questions will be answered using leaf miners, small moths that live inside aspen leaves, and their wasp predators. Answering these questions requires a large team effort, making such a project ideal for teaching scientific methods to students. The Fellow will use this opportunity to teach undergraduates from underrepresented communities, especially Native American students, how to conduct a scientific experiment, collect data, and interpret and share results.<br/><br/>To understand the thermal environment of leaf miners, the Fellow and her team will first collect temperature data using thermocouples from several hundred leaves located in various parts of aspen trees. Then, to record which temperatures are optimal for miners, the Fellow and her team will construct thermal performance curves using growth rate. Finally, the team will investigate how interactions between wasps and miners are altered by experimentally manipulating temperature in an experimental arena. The experiments are designed to test multiple hypotheses about how leaf temperature affects leaf miners and how it might alter predator-prey interactions. The Fellow will also teach Native middle school children how to use basic biological monitoring techniques with insects to assess the health of streams around the Flathead Indian Reservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellow, Elliot Gardner, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Andrew Hipp at The Morton Arboretum and Robert Raguso at Cornell University. The fellow's research project uses field studies, DNA sequencing of museum collections, and chemical analysis of floral scent to investigate convergent evolution of animal pollination of plants, specifically the oak, mulberry, and palm families. Transitions from wind to animal pollination are considered rare but likely represent an important pattern of flowering plant evolution. Although not closely related, these diverse plant families have all evolved similar dense spikes of tiny flowers that use scent to attract small insect pollinators, and these insects often use the flowers as brood sites. The fellow's research challenges some assumptions about the evolution of animal pollination, providing an important foundation for future studies on pollination transitions and, more generally, convergent evolution. The project is improving our understanding of the biology of diverse tropical trees - including important but underutilized crops - and promoting international cooperation with researchers in developing countries. The fellow is contributing to public education and outreach programs, as well as research opportunities for high-school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will produce a multidimensional picture of convergent transitions from wind to insect pollination in three divergent lineages. Data from field studies, herbarium specimens, and chemical (GC-MS) analysis of floral scent will support ancestral state reconstructions and phylogenetic comparative analyses to reveal patterns associated with transitions. Targeted sequencing of the entire terpene synthase gene family - involved in floral scent production - will reveal gene duplication and loss as well as molecular signatures of selection associated with pollination transitions. Using herbarium specimens will enable dense sampling within the target clades, highlighting the potential of museum collections for targeted next-generation sequencing. The project will generate a trait data base and genomic resources for hundreds of taxa, and clarify phylogenetic relationships in three important clades. Results will provide insight into a remarkable pattern of convergent evolution, and may shed light on the emergence of biotic pollination in ancient lineages such as cycads, whose fragrant cones resemble the convergent pattern described here.

The fellow, Sara Miller, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Michael Sheehan at Cornell University and James Highman at New York University. Character displacement is an evolutionary change in phenotype that results in decreased competition between species using the same resources or the same signals for mate choice. This process has been proposed as a key mechanism for maintaining biodiversity because it allows species to coexist that would otherwise go extinct through competition. Character displacement has been poorly examined in social insects. The United States is home to sixteen native species of paper wasps in the genus Polistes. These charismatic species exhibit striking diversity of color variation within and among species, yet occupy the same ecological niche and can have overlapping distributions. This project will provide a comprehensive overview of inter- and intraspecific color pattern diversity in these species. The fellow will test if these patterns are consistent with character displacement and will explore alternative hypotheses to explain this variation. This project will produce improved distribution maps, and detailed data on coloration and size variation for these species and will additionally develop image analysis methods that can be applied to other organisms. Data will be used to develop identification resources for researchers and citizen scientists. The fellow will mentor undergraduate students and present findings to local residents at Insectapalooza. <br/><br/>Thousands of paper wasp specimens are available in museum collections making this an unexploited resource ideally suited to large-scale studies of phenotypic variation. The fellow will compile specimen information and use ecological niche modeling to generate species distribution maps. Measurements of body size and high-resolution photographs will be taken for most specimens. Automated image processing will be used to measure and quantify color pattern variation in multidimensional space. To test for a pattern of character displacement, trait means and distributions will be compared between habitats with different species compositions. Color patterns will be compared with environmental variables and latitude to test for correlations among phenotypes and the abiotic environment. This project will also examine the process of character displacement by comparing trait distributions in species' body size and coloration before and after the recent colonization of the United States by the invasive wasp species Polistes dominula. Overall, this study will provide a much-needed assessment of the mechanisms maintaining diversity among social wasps."

This project explores a poorly understood area of plant biology: how genome and biological complexity are related and how that relationship can be manipulated to design responses such as increased tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses for agricultural applications. The future promises rich synthetic biology applications, if the next generation of scientists is appropriately trained. To address this gap, this project will provide research training in systems biology and predictive modeling for postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and undergraduate students. This team will partner with computer scientists, modeling experts, and journalism students to provide a vision of integrated systems biology for the new century. All research and outreach activities proposed are integrated with recruiting and mentoring students from underrepresented groups. This project will expose trainees and other students through daily dialogues, joint seminars, team-taught courses, and other venues. In addition, this project will develop novel computational and genomic methods that will start to integrate genotype with phenotype, thus transforming comparative biology. Access to all data, computational tools and resources generated in this project will be provided to the broader research community through long-term repositories and through CABBAGE: Community Assets for Brassica Biology And Genome Evolution, a web portal that will be integrated with the cyberinfrastructure developed by the NSF-supported iPlant Collaborative.  <br/><br/>Brassica crops have tremendous morphological and chemical diversity and are ideal for studying domestication and other economically important plant processes. The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between polyploidy (the merger and doubling of two genomes) and plasticity using the crop Brassicas. By integrating comparative genomics, networks, and genetic models, this project confronts the key question ""Did a whole genome triplication in the crop Brassicas facilitate their domestication and adaptability?"".  This project leverages the systems biology and -omics resources of Arabidopsis to focus on two hypotheses regarding how whole genome triplication (WGT) affected the Brassicas. The first is whether polyploidy in the crop Brassicas are associated with global alterations to the metabolic and gene expression networks, possibly allowing faster growth through duplication of core, high-flux, enzymes.  The second is whether polyploidy and subsequent domestication by human farmers altered the networks related to biotic stress in the crop Brassicas.  The specific objectives are to: (1) map post-polyploid duplicated genes using comparative genomics (across species of Brassica and Arabidopsis) and identify post-polyploid changes in gene co-expression and metabolism; (2) search for signatures of selection and recent adaptations to biotic stress during the parallel domestications of Brassica oleracea (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi) and B. rapa (turnips, Chinese cabbage, Pak Choi, and oilseeds); and (3) survey gene expression and glucosinolate levels in F1 hybrids of B. oleracea morphotypes to identify functional elements in genetic response to stress.  Analyses of genome organization and gene expression will improve the current understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic innovation. Analyses of transcriptome and metabolic data will identify the types of variation selected during domestication and describe the resulting changes to metabolism, growth, and biotic stress response. Further, this project will describe the evolution of gene expression patterns in Brassica and test genome-scale models of metabolic networks in Brassica, which will be refined with glucosinolate measurements."

Recent changes of project leadership and supporting foundation creates an ideal opportunity to build on past successes and create a plan to ensure the legacy and sustainability of HRF as a field station. This plan is needed in part because a whole new set of environmental challenges, not foreseen in 1982, have emerged. The plan will develop strategies to stimulate research and teaching on the value of healthy managed forest ecosystems, climate change adaptation, and forest dynamics at the urban/rural interface. A strategic plan will establish the steps needed for establishing an enhanced infrastructure, a refined data management plan with increased access to the valuable long-term data, broader dissemination of research results, and developing greater communication between HRF and similar field stations. A key outcome of the planning grant and resulting strategic plan would be expanded opportunities for teaching, training, and learning that engage graduate students, postdocs, undergraduate students, K-12 teachers and youth, and adult learners. <br/><br/>The Holt Research Forest (HRF) a field station located in southern mid-coastal Maine and has a 35-year history of multidisciplinary ecological research. The site features a red oak white pine forest ecosystem, an important and relatively understudied forest type, estuarine frontage with salt marshes and tidal flats, and the largest fresh water pond on the island. The unique coastal setting of HRF within the nationally recognized Kennebec Estuary with 30,000acres of conservation lands within a 15 mile radius provides a wide spectrum of possibilities for expansion of research. This planning project seeks to articulate the growth potential for research, educational, and public outreach programming. The process will involve a wide diversity of stakeholders and potential beneficiaries. Other universities and colleges, scientists, natural resource professionals, local schools, conservation organizations, state agencies, woodlot owners, and the general public will all be engaged to improve the outcomes.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The fellow will conduct research to improve our understanding of the role of rapid evolution in facilitating biological invasions. A longstanding theory in the field predicts that decreased genetic diversity normally associated with small initial populations of invasive species should reduce the likelihood of success for these species. However, invasive species are everywhere across the globe, and result in hundreds of billions of dollars in economic costs each year. The fellow will apply recently developed DNA sequencing techniques to museum specimens of an invasive Great Lakes fish, the round goby, to look for evidence of genetic adaptations associated with this species ability to spread across the Laurentian Great Lakes since 1990. An improved understanding of the evolutionary processes that allow biological invasions to succeed will allow natural resource managers to better anticipate which species pose the greatest risks, increasing the likelihood of successful prevention or mitigation of invasions. The fellow will engage K-12 and undergraduate teaching programs to design active learning classroom lessons focused on biological invasions, which provide an elegant nexus between concepts related to biology, ecology, and evolution. <br/><br/>This research project will be completed using a spatially- and temporally-explicit landscape genomics approach that accounts for demographic processes that often make genomic detections of selection difficult. By using genomic data derived from museum specimens collected throughout the Great Lakes region since the invasion began, the project will provide a unique opportunity to empirically observe changes in allele frequencies associated with adaptation to novel environmental stressors. To complement methods seeking genomic signals of selection, the fellow will also evaluate associations between genetic data and a suite of morphological and environmental variables. This project will provide the fellow with training in laboratory and bioinformatic analyses of degraded DNA, including DNA extraction from formalin-preserved samples and sequencing via target capture. The genome-wide panel of loci used in the analyses will provide a resource for future genomic research on round gobies.

The fellow, Doug Booher, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Corrie Moreau (Field Museum of Natural History) and Andrew Suarez (University of Illinois). The fellow's research aims to describe and explain the changes in the abundance, distribution, and diversity of native species as non-native species arrived and spread. Human-caused transport of non-native plants and animals is moving species at unprecedented rates across the globe. These introduced species are the second leading cause of extinctions. Therefore, understanding how invasive species impact ecological communities over different time scales is a major question in ecological research. In Florida, approximately 25% of 239 ant species are non-native and about half these introductions happened in the last 35 years. The fellow is assessing the impact of invasive ant species, using very large and geographically extensive collections of ant communities collected in Florida over the past several decades, supplemented by older records in museum collections. In addition to pursuing these research interests, the fellow is engaging in public outreach programs for grade-school age children as well as training future scientists through integrative biology internship programs while conducting research at Field Museum and the University of Illinois.<br/><br/>This research has two main objectives in using available museum collections: (1) to investigate the long-term fates of invasive species and the corresponding dynamics of native communities after invasion to test competing hypotheses of community assembly i.e. neutral vs. niche assembly; and (2) to evaluate the importance of seven traits hypothesized to explain the ecological success of invasive species. Traits hypothesized to confer competitive success are continuous reproduction, polygyny, supercoloniality, omnivory, habitat generality, nest opportunism, and worker polymorphism. For these objectives, the fellow will investigate community dynamics at two phylogenetic scales: at a coarse phylogenetic scale, communities of all ants, and at a finer phylogenetic scale, communities of congeneric ants. In Florida, there are five common and/or diverse ant genera with native and non-native representative species. This will allow for a phylogenetically controlled statistical comparisons of ant community dynamics where members of these communities are more likely to overlap in life history and ecological traits due to shared ancestry. Once digitized, the collections data of this research will be publicly available through Antweb.org.  As one of the largest and longest time series collections of ants from a single region, these data will be invaluable to community ecologist, invasive ecologists, pest management scientist, evolutionary biologist, biodiversity scientists, climate scientists, and conservationist."

The ESCAPE will lead to significant advances in animal physiology and ecology research by enabling scientists to evaluate the physiological and behavioral responses of wild animals to long-term changes in the environment. The project will use a laboratory-to-field approach to: (1) Design a power-scavenging device that uses the locomotion of the animal to charge an onboard capacitor and battery. (2) Integrate the power generation device with a GPS, accelerometers, and magnetometers to measure animal behavior, energetics, and movement. (3) Test the ESCAPE on three terrestrial species (domestic dogs, trained elephants and wild mountain lions) and its potential assessed on two marine mammal species (trained dolphins and sea lions). <br/><br/>This comparative approach will allow the research to evaluate the ramifications of locomotory mode, body mass and environment on the functionality and durability of the collars or tags. These tests will also provide a ""proof of concept"" regarding the collar's capability to collect, store, and send various types of longitudinal data. By relying on animal movement to charge the device, ESCAPE will provide up to order-of-magnitude increases in tag deployment time, allowing researchers to compile long-term data sets crucial for the study of wild animal physiology and ecology. The development of the ESCAPE will leverage a unique interdisciplinary team from the Departments of Environmental Studies, Ecology and Evolution, Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The ESCAPE collar is expected to be widely adopted by the research community at large and lead to breakthroughs in animal ecology, conservation and management. The insights gleaned from these collars will also greatly inform public understanding of animal behavior and conservation.  Outreach activities associated with the research will include presentations at professional academic conferences, monthly public lectures, field trips for middle and high school children, as well as the production of a professional video showcasing the ESCAPE technology.

The development of methods to quantify mercury stable isotopes provides new insights into sources of pollution in ecosystems.  This powerful tracer reveals whether mercury accumulated in fish tissues was derived from local weather sources, long-distance atmospheric sources, or regional human activities. To date, use of mercury isotopes in fish has been restricted solely to near present-day samples. The remarkable archives of fish tissues preserved in museums can expand the size and the time-scale for analyzing mercury in fish. However, these archives have never been used for large-scale assessment of mercury contamination. This proposal will be one of the first to assess mercury contamination in multiple different collections of fish. Recognition of mercury as a global threat, due to neurotoxic effects in humans and wildlife, has led to efforts to reduce mercury contamination in many nations.  The data from this proposal can help to better understand where these levels of mercury are coming from, which can help to inform mercury management and mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>This project includes three core elements: 1) A rigorous experimental test of how chemical preservation affects the concentration and isotope ratios of mercury in fish. 2) Comparing recent and historical collections from Africa?s Lake Victoria (where erosion, gold mining, and aquaculture have increased mercury) and Lake Tanganyika (where anthropogenic inputs of mercury are minimal) to reconstruct changes in mercury sources and concentrations in these massive lacustrine fisheries. 3) Quantifying pollution through time for major riverine fisheries worldwide. These approaches will use archived specimens to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of global contamination of freshwater fisheries. After developing correction factors for interpreting results from preserved tissues, we will resolve the impact of human activities relative to natural geogenic inputs of mercury. Using fish rather than sediment cores to infer temporal shifts in mercury bioaccumulation will sidestep assumptions about bioavailability that have complicated previous approaches. Coupling mercury concentrations and isotope data will give insight to sources of intensive pollution, and the resulting geography of health threat. Findings will be conveyed to national fishery management authorities and the United Nations Global Mercury Program, to develop targeted mitigation strategies. The information can also motivate local education efforts to make subsistence anglers aware of the threat to their family's health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This research explores the relationship between form and function, a classic problem in biology. The fellow will investigate this problem by studying the mammalian lumbar spine (lower back). The nature of the form-function relationship varies across organisms, sizes, and structures, and is especially difficult to understand for extreme or unique structures. Extra bony reinforcements have evolved in the spine of anteaters, armadillo, and several shrews, but it is unclear if these reinforcements serve similar functions because their extreme and unusual shapes make them difficult to compare. The fellow will use specialized imaging techniques to analyze the internal structure of the vertebrae in shrews, anteaters, and armadillos. Internal bone structure is indicative of adaptation in response to forces applied to a bone, so this analysis will determine possible functional similarities between these structures that is difficult to detect using external bone structure. This project will promote understanding of how natural selection works to shape morphology; further, it provides an exciting example to demonstrate to the public that scientific understanding of evolution is constantly growing, and collections-based research is critical for facilitating that growth.<br/><br/>The fellow will quantify trabecular bone morphology of the lumbar spine in shrews and xenarthrans to test the following hypotheses: 1) convergent evolution of supplementary intervertebral articulations in shrews and xenarthrans reflects adaptation to similar in-vivo loading schemes; 2) a greater degree of external modification corresponds to a vertebral column that is more robust to bearing high in-vivo loads; and 3) vertebral function varies across shrews and xenarthrans according to locomotor type rather than size or phylogeny.

As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to decrease, it is now routine for multiple genomes per species to be available for analysis, giving much more information about the species. The approach makes use of a graph-based representation of a pangenome and exploits this representation to efficiently find both shared and unique regions of interest across genomes. Each individual?s genomic sequence corresponds to path in a graph data structure called a De Bruijn graph; these graphs are large and can have millions of nodes and edges.  The tools being developed are based on finding frequented regions (FRs) in De Bruijn graphs; these regions are hotspots that often represent features of interest in one or more genomes. Algorithms and software tools will be made available to the greater scientific community to facilitate new pangenomics research.  The project will provide support and training for a postdoc and an incoming PhD student at Montana State University. It will also support a summer intern in the last two years at the National Center for Genome Resources.  Aspects of the project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as integrated into several outreach and training activities at NCGR. In addition, MSU has several programs in place to serve American Indian students and the PIs will actively recruit from and engage this community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The current trajectory of next generation sequencing improvements, including falling costs and increased read lengths and throughput, ensure that multiple genomes per species will be routine within the next decade.

Therefore, understanding how protein sequence describes function and structure is a fundamental problem in biological research. Yet, the traditional interpretation of protein sequences is 3ased on either manual identification of sub-sequence patterns or some arbitrary dissection of a sequence into subsequences of fixed size; neither approach can accurately recognize all of the semantic components in a protein sequence that are relevant to its structure and function. In this project, powerful artificial intelligence methods, based on deep learning, will be designed such that they can automatically map protein sequences into high-level semantic features that are meaningful when related to protein structure and function. This will not only improve the accuracy of predicting protein structural and functional properties, but also provide a new way of representing and interpreting proteins biological function, transforming how protein data are interpreted. The impact of the basic research will be broadened through open source software dissemination to other researchers, seminars on deep learning and bioinformatics, student training, involvement of minority and female students, publications, presentations, workshops, and outreach activities for high school students, as well as thoughtfully crafted communication with the Missouri state legislature, and other members of the general public.<br/><br/>During the research, novel deep one-dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D convolutional neural networks will be developed to translate protein sequences or structures of arbitrary size into high-level features under the guidance of improving the prediction of multiple residue-wise local structural/functional properties (secondary structures, solvent accessibility, torsion angle, disorder, contact map, disulfide bonds, beta-sheet pairings, and protein functional sites) as well as global properties such as folds. The 1D convolutional neural network for interpreting protein sequence data will also be supplemented by the long- and short-term memory networks. The comprehensive deep learning models will be trained by innovative multi-task learning and transfer learning to enhance prediction performance. The 1D, 2D and 3D convolutional networks will be further integrated to improve the accuracy of analyzing protein sequence, structure and function. The 1D and 3D convolutional neural networks are completely original, and the new 2D convolutional architecture is more comprehensive and versatile than existing approaches.

As the cost of DNA sequencing continues to decrease, it is now routine for multiple genomes per species to be available for analysis, giving much more information about the species. The approach makes use of a graph-based representation of a pangenome and exploits this representation to efficiently find both shared and unique regions of interest across genomes. Each individual?s genomic sequence corresponds to path in a graph data structure called a De Bruijn graph; these graphs are large and can have millions of nodes and edges.  The tools being developed are based on finding frequented regions (FRs) in De Bruijn graphs; these regions are hotspots that often represent features of interest in one or more genomes. Algorithms and software tools will be made available to the greater scientific community to facilitate new pangenomics research.  The project will provide support and training for a postdoc and an incoming PhD student at Montana State University. It will also support a summer intern in the last two years at the National Center for Genome Resources.  Aspects of the project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at MSU, as well as integrated into several outreach and training activities at NCGR. In addition, MSU has several programs in place to serve American Indian students and the PIs will actively recruit from and engage this community.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The current trajectory of next generation sequencing improvements, including falling costs and increased read lengths and throughput, ensure that multiple genomes per species will be routine within the next decade. This project initiates work on a next generation of bioinformatics software that can exploit the increased information content available from multiple accessions and intelligently use the data for unbiased, species-wide analyses.  The proposed work will refine algorithms and develop software to address important problems in each of the identified areas. The research team has a variety of complementary expertise ranging from molecular biology, algorithms, machine learning and genomics research.  Pangenomic biology will be advanced through automatic identification of candidate regions of interest in a pangenome. Methods will be developed to discover regions that are conserved across evolutionary space, regions that are novel, and regions that have diverged due to positive selection.  Machine learning techniques will be used to search for interesting genomic regions. Lastly, this work will complement the work being done on the model plant, Medicago truncatula, contributing to research on its symbiotic relationships.

A premier example is the toxic chemicals in the skin of poison frogs. Because these frogs are brightly colored, predators such as birds and snakes learn to avoid them. These toxins are alkaloids, found in many animals and plants. The frogs acquire these chemical defenses by eating ants and other arthropods that contain the alkaloids. These frog alkaloids (e.g., tetrodotoxin, batrachotoxin) are pharmacologically important and cause muscle paralysis, and disrupt breathing and cardiac function. At the cellular level, alkaloids affect ion channels, which control the transmission of nerve impulses. Surprisingly, the ion channels of poison frogs are are not affected by their own toxins; thus, deciphering how this evolved has important broader impacts that translate to human health. This research will use evolutionary trees to guide the activities: fieldwork to acquire and characterize natural alkaloids and collect ecological data on the species, molecular evolution of ion channel resistance to alkaloids, and neurophysiological effects of alkaloids on ion channels. The research will provide opportunities for students from the University of Texas and Indiana State University to jointly participate in international fieldwork, acquire new skills in bioinformatics, molecular modeling, genomics, and neurophysiology, as well as promote interactions between the two universities.<br/><br/>The project will use Next-Generation DNA sequencing of transcriptomes, targeted sequencing of hundreds of genes, and bioinformatics methods to reconstruct evolutionary trees that will guide the research program with an experimental framework for explaining the origin of resistance, which has evolved multiple times in the poison frogs (family Dendrobatidae). Sequencing will also be used to identify novel amino acid replacements that may confer resistance to alkaloids. Computational modeling and in vitro assays of mutated ion channels will determine if these novel replacements provide resistance to natural and synthesized alkaloids. Fieldwork will focus on acquiring genetic samples, skin alkaloids, and color photographs from multiple populations of frogs, using natural history collection standards data collection and voucher specimens preparation. The combination of approaches will provide novel insights in the systematics of Dendrobatidae poison frogs, and also the evolution of auto-resistance to toxic alkaloids within the group."

The Ordovician Period was the second greatest period in the history of animal life, about 485 to 444 million years ago.  The diversity of life increased remarkably during the Ordovician Period until the mass extinction event at the end of the Period.  The Indiana University Paleontology Collection has systematically documented fossil records of 10 million years leading up to the extinction, including a series of fossils that were collected in the early 1900s when a new railway grade was cut through Indiana's Ordovician rocks along Tanner's Creek near Cincinnati. The fossils in the Ordovician collection document the migration of ancient marine organisms in response to changing sea level, demonstrate evolutionary adaptation to changing environments, and reveal ecological interactions that help explain why some groups survived the extinction and others did not.  Digitizing the collections makes this material accessible for large-scale quantitative scientific studies.  Importantly, digitization also makes these incredible fossils available to students, teachers, and fossil enthusiasts in Indiana, across the nation, and around the world.  This project will involve K-12 teachers in developing school curriculum exercises based on the fossils and on the digitization process. It will also engage the region's avocational paleontological community in the digitization initiative, giving them unprecedented access to the same fossil research collections used by scientists.  <br/><br/>The paleontological holdings that will be digitized through this project include macrofossils and thin sections that were collected along the entire Ordovician outcrop of the Kope, Dillsboro, and Whitewater Formations in Indiana.  The species are closely tied to a series of well-documented measured sections that provide stratigraphic and sedimentological context.  The material includes an extensive and unique series of bryozoan thin sections produced by E.R. Cumings and J.J. Galloway.   This material adds substantially to the PaleoNICHES digitization initiative of the Cincinnati Arch by filling in its entire western flank.  Inter-basin dispersals between the Cincinnati Arch and western epicontinental seas were mediated by rises and falls in sea level through the late Ordovician Period that iteratively flooded and exposed the transcontinental arch.  Spatially and temporally resolved digital occurrences of complete faunas are used to study the timing of dispersal events and changes in ecological associations that were mediated by these eustatic changes.  This project will utilize the stratigraphic and taxonomic backbone of the digitized collections from the Cincinnati Arch region to serve as a launchpad for engaging K-12 students and citizen scientists using the Notes from Nature transcription portal.  This rich, interactive content will be generated for smartphone apps (including the Digital Atlas of Ancient Life) to expand the use of biological collections data into regional K-12 classrooms and online, via curated curricula hosted on iDigPaleo.  High-quality specimen data and images will also be made available through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org)."

Over the past five years, 47 researchers from 17 universities, including undergraduate, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, have also conducted research at Karisoke and data from Karisoke has been used in collaborations with more than 40 institutions. Despite the long-term success of Karisoke as a research site, its facilities are not currently adequate to support this range of inquiry and demonstrate the limitations of ad hoc field facilities. Particularly, the laboratory and herbarium are desperately in need of refurbishment. These facilities lack adequate sanitation, ventilation, and the organizational capacity to store samples. This improvement project will provide the infrastructure needed for broad interdisciplinary research in the fields of endocrinology, genetics, disease ecology, and conservation biology. The primary outcomes will be an improved laboratory facility to advance innovative, interdisciplinary research, and a high-functioning herbarium, including a digital archive, to aid national and global collaborative research to better understand the increasing changes to the region's flora. In addition, improvements to these facilities will be utilized by visiting researchers around the world, as well as by host-country researchers (undergraduate and graduate students, and scientists), where there is a great need for next generation scientists. <br/><br/>The need for a modern Karisoke laboratory facility has been growing over the past 15 years and has become acute in the last five years as vast developments in new lab techniques and a need for increasingly interdisciplinary research has emerged.

Additional improvements include installing exhume hood exhaust systems along with refrigeration units and storage for samples. The KRC herbarium will be reconstructed into a biological sample storage room with state of the art storage and climate control measures. A drying preservation stage will be installed in a separate room to reduce the risk of contamination.

Auburn University completed a new, state-of-the-art facility for their collections in 2013.  Since moving to the new facility, the collections have seen remarkable growth, not just in terms of the number of specimens, but in the outreach that the museum is able to perform for people in the state and region.  The museum absorbed collections from other university units and orphaned collections from other institutions in the area, putting strain on the space available.  The collections stored in alcohol (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates) have grown at a particularly fast rate, and the alcohol storage area is limited because of needed safety measures for the proper storage of flammable liquids.  <br/><br/>This project will provide compactorized shelving that will dramatically increase the amount of space within the alcohol collections.  Moving invertebrate specimens from an area not currently rated for storage in ethanol into the compactors will also allow growth of the dry collections (particularly insects), which are also approaching capacity.

First, it incorporates cutting edge methods on a poorly understood group of organisms in a region of the world with a unique fauna. These findings will provide important information on how animals adapt to novel environments. Furthermore, Madagascar is an isolated region in dire need of conservation initiatives, which need to be informed by an understanding of species diversity and ecology.

Even though the application of DNA sequencing technologies has allowed profiling the response of these communities to external perturbations, the important knowledge resulting from this approach stems from descriptive and correlation-based analysis of these data. This strongly limits the understanding of the ecology (e.g. how the microbes interact) of these systems and, more importantly, hinders the ability to make quantitative predictions. This project will deliver new theoretical methods and related computational algorithms that, for the first time, allow forecasting microbiome dynamics that are typically constrained with sequencing surveys. This will benefit researchers working on host-associated and environmental microbiomes as it will enable them to computationally explore scenarios that are difficult to set-up experimentally. The tools developed in this project will be delivered as an open-source, freely downloadable and upgradable package, and will encourage and enable end-user contributions with the novel scripts and algorithms provided. Multiple graduate and undergraduate students will be included in the project and will benefit from interdisciplinary hands-on training in mathematical and computational biology, statistics, and microbial genetics. As the proposed methods combine concept from multi-linear regression and solution of large systems of differential equations, they will perfectly integrate with coursework in Biostatistics and Theoretical Biology at UMass Dartmouth. <br/><br/>This research will deliver the first computational suite that allows for simulating and predicting microbiome dynamics consistent with metagenomics observations. This will be achieved by: 1) the development of new time-reverse engineering inference methods solved by a combination of regularized regression and quadratic programming for the estimation of an optimal set of model parameters, and 2) the application of computational tools for metagenome reconstruction based on modeling predictions. This research will also include the development of explicit and implicit numerical methods for the solution of large systems of differential equations to predict microbiome transient dynamics and the use of linear stability analysis to determine all possible microbiome predicted configuration states in response to different sets of perturbations. Method testing and validation against data from simple in silico and in vitro microbial ecosystem of known ecological structure will allow accuracy testing of the proposed approaches both for predicting temporal dynamics and in recovering the correct microbial interaction network in response to external perturbation. Method application (and validation) on diverse datasets will allow testing of fundamental hypotheses about the role of the intestinal microbiome in resisting colonization by foreign bacteria and in shaping host immunity.

The ocean current profiler will track water movement on and adjacent to reefs, information that can help track where fish eggs and larvae go after spawning. This important aspect of the life history of fish will help to estimate where young fishes come from after spending their larval life in the open ocean. The CTD profiler will be used to measure how the temperature and salinity of the ocean and lagoon varies with depth. In Palau's marine lakes these instruments can also provide information leading to important work on climate change, where bottom cores from the lake provide a historical record of past climates. All of these instruments are used to measure important physical characteristics of the ocean, lagoon and marine lakes. Overall this project will improve the understanding of highly diverse tropical marine environments and their resources which are under increasing stress from climate change and human population pressure.<br/><br/>The project will purchase 1) a multibeam sonar system for bathymetric mapping, 2) two Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and 3) two Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) profilers. All equipment will be used by visiting researchers and staff at the Coral Reef Research Foundation (CRRF) in Koror, Palau (coralreefpalau.org). The multibeam system will be used to map outer slope reef environments and deep lagoon areas to benefit broad studies of mesophotic environments, topography of reef fish spawning aggregations, and marine lakes. The current profiles will be used to study fish spawning aggregations, fish vortices, and marine lake hydrodynamics while the CTDs will complement other location specific data collection. The equipment will enhance long-term data collection efforts stimulated by major events such as coral bleaching (1998, 2010) and jellyfish population crashes (1999, 2016). Broad impacts of the work include addressing the suggestion that mesophotic coral reefs are possible ""lifeboats"" for shallow water (less than 30 m depth) coral reefs, and help move beyond the relatively simple considerations of deep reef refugia presently being debated. Deep reefs also hold various organisms usable as proxies for questions of climate change, including ocean warming and sea level rise, and mapping will help delineate where such organisms occur. The health and fate of reef fish spawning aggregations, critical for fisheries in developing countries and understanding human impacts on reef fisheries, will be examined in new ways to quantify the locations and number/sizes of fish present.

Understanding how they work is critical to both a better scientific understanding of the fundamental processes of life, and to modifying or improving their function.  Despite the fact that proteins are physically 3-dimensional structures of cooperating parts, the current state of the art for representing and studying proteins uses a description that is simply a sequential list of the parts used in their assembly.  This sequential-list style of description has biased the development of tools for protein analysis to accentuate the sequential properties of these molecules, and to ignore the fact that the parts must work together in unison for the protein to function.  This project will adapt a recently-developed statistical technique, the Conditional Random Field (CRF), that can quantitatively represent densely-connected networks of features, and a recently-developed visualization tool that enables interactive exploration of these networks, for the task of describing proteins.  Structurally, Conditional Random Fields appear to recapitulate the process by which evolution has selected for parts that cooperate in proteins, and protein descriptions based on CRFs will be able to predict whether a change to a protein - a mutation - would have been tolerated by evolution, or selected against as non-functional.  This information will aid in predicting the effect of a mutation, or multiple mutations to a protein, using much more of the available information, than is currently utilized by state-of-the-art tools.<br/><br/>This work will broadly impact the study of proteins, improving a range of activities from basic scientific studies of function, to endeavors in protein engineering. In addition, the ""change in protein sequence to change in protein function"" problem is a ""model organism"" for many other types of biological and non-biological systems where rich interactions between parts of the system demand a sophisticated statistical approach.  To-date, in most of these fields, models that are similarly limited to those currently used in proteins are the de-facto standard.  Developing the tools necessary for applying CRFs to protein data, and methods of establishing testable ground-truth in this system, will enhance the application of CRFs to many other domains where they may provide a significant advantage over current methods.   The products of this project will be made freely available to the research community as online tools, and the methods will be incorporated in coursework, first in the Biophysics Graduate Program at The Ohio State University, and as the teachable component matures, made available as lesson-plan material appropriate for both primary and secondary education.  By developing a tool that makes interdependencies between features visually explorable and modifications of these dependencies quantifiably predictable, we will promote more thorough consideration of the true complexity of data and systems in many domains."

Biological macromolecules are highly regulated nanomachines that are dynamic and often show considerable flexibility while performing their functions. Knowing the full range of the conformations that molecules may take during a functional cycle is essential for understanding those functions. Methods for preparing biomolecules for imaging using electron microscopy can preserve this rich conformational landscape, allowing researchers to study the full range of structures. Improvements in electron microscope technology allow researchers to obtain resolutions as low as 0.5 nm when macromolecules have one or only a few conformations. However, the more flexible the macromolecule the more conformations it can take, and it has not been possible to obtain a similar level of resolution of molecules having global or continuous structure variations - this research aims to fill that gap. In this project we will develop multivariate statistical methods to facilitate the exploration of structural variations covering the full conformational space. We will implement highly adaptable non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for applying to the results of established multivariate statistical image analysis techniques, or directly to the data. After sorting data according to similarity, a second step is necessary to determine the conformational spectrum. Sufficiently homogeneous subsets of projections or volumes are extracted and can be used for 3D structure determination, either through 3D reconstruction from projections or sub-tomogram averaging. For efficiently obtaining high resolution structures, these techniques will be combined with a new streamlined method for the correction of the microscope contrast transfer function (CTF) addressing specifically the continuously varying CTF in images of tilted specimens. The new methods will be applied to two biologically relevant systems: Complex I and EmaA. Complex I, the first and largest enzyme in the respiratory chain of mitochondria and bacteria, is essential for the survival of all aerobic living cells. However, its function is still little understood. EmaA is a very large glycosylated bacterial adhesin that binds to collagen during the first and essential step of the infectious process. <br/><br/>The new tools developed will provide a timely, reliable and robust methodology to discern the different conformations of biological macromolecules and will be applicable to large number of biological complexes. The reconstruction of Complex I will contribute to the understanding of this enzyme, central to cellular energy metabolism. Knowledge of the structure of bacterial adhesins will help resolve between the existing paradigms explaining the role of glycosylation in bacterial adhesion and thus will help advance the understanding of key elements of the infectious process. These two biological systems are not unique, and the methods developed here will help advance the understanding of the structure function of an abundant number of macromolecules, whose function is still little understood. The results of the project will be presented at national and international meetings, and published in peer-reviewed journals. All software developed will be documented and made freely available to the scientific community under an open source license. Solved structures will be deposited in the EMDataBank."

It is an actively growing and heavily utilized research herbarium, and is the primary resource for the documentation and study of Oregon's diverse plants and fungi. This project will enable the addition of approximately 220,000 lichen specimens permanently transferred from the USDA Forest Service (USFS). These specimens were collected as part of the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and Air Resource Management programs. They comprise a unique and voluminous source of data and specimens not available in regular herbarium collections. The extensive, fine-grained sampling framework for the FIA program provides an exceptional basis for species distribution modeling, phylogeography, and measuring biological responses to environmental change. The need to secure these specimens is urgent because they are currently housed in non-archival conditions and are inaccessible to researchers. Incorporating the USFS specimens into the OSU Herbarium will protect them for the future by virtue of OSU's commitment to long-term preservation and use of biological collections. In addition, a popular educational resource developed at OSU for learning about lichens (http://ocid.nacse.org/lichenland) will be revitalized and enhanced as part of this project.<br/><br/>To accommodate the USFS lichen collections, 54 steel herbarium cases will be added to the OSU Herbarium. The lichen specimen labels will be photographed in order to capture information that is not maintained in the FIA and Air Resource Management electronic databases.

The workshop on Developing a Global Inventory of Brain Initiatives aims to advance discussions on coordinating Brain Initiatives around the globe.  It focuses on the development of an International Brain Initiative Inventory that will collect and report key information about each regional initiative in an accessible fashion.  Although there are significant independent efforts to catalog the developing neurotechnologies and approaches for acquisition and management of data, these efforts are not coordinated and do not communicate effectively with one another.  As such, there is a need for the implementation of a live inventory of Brain Initiatives, to promote the coordination of large-scale projects that require multinational involvement and to reduce duplication and increase efficiency of resources developed through various brain initiatives globally.  The International Brain Inventory will serve to broaden accessibility to Brain Initiative tools, data, and other resources, as well as increase collaboration by US investigators with investigators from other countries.  This workshop critically informs inventory development by providing input from a diverse group of US and international neuroscientists and communicating inventory goals to the broader neuroscience community.  In addition, the workshop serves to build relationships among global Brain Initiatives.  By working to inform the International Brain Inventory, ultimate goals of this project include to: (1) increase accessibility of all countries to Brain Initiatives work and products, and (2) promote multinational collaborations.  Further, by communicating these efforts to the public, the workshop enhances awareness of global brain research efforts and interactions between the US and other Brain Initiatives.<br/><br/>There are three specific aims of the workshop:  1. To consider what content to include in an International Brain Initiative Inventory, and advise on content and structure, with a focus on what would be most useful to the scientific community; 2. To suggest approaches for dissemination of inventory information and other mechanisms that encourage use and communication across International Brain Initiatives; and 3. To recommend approaches for receiving feedback from the neuroscience community and evaluating the effectiveness of the inventory.  The primary product of the workshop is a publication that will summarize the discussion and articulates the group?s perspective on key aspects of a global inventory as outlined above:  inventory content, input and structure, dissemination, and evaluation.  The publication will also outline steps for engaging the scientific community in this work.  A secondary product of the workshop is to propose strategies for communicating inventory efforts to the public.  An additional goal of the workshop and surrounding collaborative work of its participants is the strengthening of dialog and relationships between neuroscientists and Brain Initiative leaders across many countries, governmental agencies, and foundations to accelerate our understanding of brain function<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transcriptome assembly and gene expression profiling are key components in a vast range of biological experiments today, playing a central role in unraveling the complexity of cell types, cell differentiation, responses to stress, and myriad other conditions. Although transcript assemblers have been developed previously, most of them perform poorly on real, large-scale RNA sequencing data sets, severely limiting their impact. To produce better transcript models, an innovative new method will be developed, combining ideas from several scientific disciplines. By ensuring that this method works on the very large data sets that are routinely produced by modern next-generation sequencing instruments, this project will have an impact on a wide range of studies across the spectrum of eukaryotic species. It will also enhance the research infrastructure by providing free, open source software that can be re-used by other scientists for commercial, educational, or basic research endeavors.<br/><br/>This new method uses an optimization technique known as maximum flow in a specially-constructed flow network to determine gene expression levels, and it does this while simultaneously assembling each splice variant of a gene. It also incorporates techniques from whole-genome assembly, which has the potential to dramatically improve detection of alternative splice variants. By using pre-assembled reads, the computational load and memory storage requirements associated with transcriptome assembly will be greatly reduced, as many of the short reads will be combined into longer contigs that span multiple exons. Furthermore, the new method will address a critical need for a transcriptome assembly method that is able to handle the numerous gaps present in draft genomes, and to produce better-assembled transcripts by stitching together portions of transcripts situated on multiple fragments of the genome.

Department leaders from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities were selected as PULSE Leadership Fellows. Such improvements in how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions are expected to enhance students' understanding of core concepts in the life sciences, increase retention rates for students in the life sciences, and improve preparation for all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens. This project will establish an educational network across twelve states in the Great Plains and Midwest focused on spurring the organizational, department-level change needed for heightening alignment of undergraduate life sciences programs with evidence-based practices outlined in Vision and Change. In so doing, the network will increase the number of persons equipped with the scientific and technical skills to meet the nation's need for a technically skilled workforce.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this projects rests on two aims of the Great Plains and Midwest PULSE network to: 1) expand the network membership to reach a critical mass of effective change leaders who can motivate and guide colleagues at their home institutions toward curricular, pedagogical, and organizational transformation; and 2) coordinate, standardize, and synthesize evaluation efforts that ask whether the change processes initiated and led by network members support departmental adoption of evidence-based practices and the recommendations in Vision and Change. The major activities will involve workshops to support the growth of communities of practice. Additional activities include formative and summative evaluation of the network, coupled with systems analysis to comprehend the structure and dynamics of change within the complex systems of STEM higher education. Through these activities, the network will: (i) empower faculty members in the process of building institutional capacity for inclusive excellence in undergraduate education; (ii) deepen participants' understanding of strategies for leading organizational change and provide information, opportunities for collaboration, and mutual support across the network; and (iii) contribute to knowledge on effective ways to promote organizational change in undergraduate STEM education.

The CCMS coordinates the marine research and teaching at the University, primarily using the Cal Poly Pier. The Pier extends 1 km into Port San Luis Bay, and has an extensive flow-through seawater system as well as facilities for diving operations and the deployment of small boats. However, the existing boat landing on the pier is an aging, fixed platform that is marginally safe and usable only during the calmest of sea conditions, conditions that are rarely present on the California central coast. This project will replace the current access platforms with a larger fixed platform and calls for the installation of a camel vessel mooring and fender system to provide a buffer between the pier and vessels moored against it. The project will also increase the capacity of the hoist, allowing for easier deployment of vessels. This will make deployment of vessels and access to the waterline and vessels much safer and easier, permitting access in a variety of sea conditions and tidal heights. The new platforms and hoist will allow the CCMS to further increase capacity and scope for year-round field research and field teaching, all while improving access and efficiency and greatly increasing safety.  <br/><br/>The CCMS, the Pier, and all resources are managed by the College of Science and Math. These resources are available to any researcher or faculty member in the College for no cost, aside from consumables (e.g. fuel), providing a significant in-kind contribution to and lowering the cost of marine science teaching and research. The CCMS currently operates five research vessels, from a 13 foot Boston Whaler to a 26 foot Radon, the R/V Tom Richards. In the Pier's current state, the only boat access to the water is via a fixed landing with upper and lower elements at approximately 3 and 1 m above mean lower low water (MLLW), respectively. As such, access to the water is challenging in all but the calmest sea conditions, which are rarely present along the California central coast. The main elements of this project include removal of the current lower landing, expansion of the upper landing to cover an area of 12 x 20 ft., installation of a camel vessel mooring and fender system to provide a buffer between the pier and vessels moored against it, and replacement of the current jib crane motor and hoist mechanism to a 1-ton capacity system. This expansion and improvement will provide greatly enhanced access to the waterline and to Cal Poly's fleet of small boats in a range of sea conditions, significantly improving safety and expanding the educational and scientific opportunities for marine science students and researchers at Cal Poly."

Such improvements in how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions are expected to lead to increases in:  1)  student learning of core concepts in the life sciences, 2) retention rates for students in the life sciences, and 3) preparation for all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.  <br/><br/>Although individual faculty members have been very active in instituting reforms in their classrooms, departmental and institutional transformation has been more difficult. This proposal will address this challenge by creating a network of institutions in geographical proximity so they can support and advise one another as each moves to implement departmental change.  Tools and resources have been developed by the PULSE Leadership Fellows that will be field-tested by the different types of participating institutions in the Northwest. For example, rubrics for departmental self-assessment and visits by trained Ambassadors will be provided to assist departments in adopting reforms in how life science courses are taught. During each year of this award, fifteen participating institutions from across the spectrum of Institutions of Higher Education will identify teams of faculty, administrators, and students to participate in on-line training sessions, in-person workshops, and follow up activities, including a regional symposium for biology instructors. The NW PULSE efforts target change at the department level and a key aspect is training in a systems-thinking approach.  This enables institutional teams to recognize their department as a system whose behavior they can influence and helps them to understand and identify leverage points, thus empowering them to act as change agents at their home institutions. It is hoped that this Community of Practice will increase awareness of the recommendations made in the Vision and Change report, accelerate the pace of adopting those recommendations by different departments, and lead to a better understanding of how change happens on diverse campuses. Results from the network's activities will be shared with the life sciences community, primarily via the www.pulsecommunity.org website and by continued partnerships with other groups advocating for change in life science education in the Northwest.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/"

Although many programs designed to broaden participation exist, few individuals in ""STEM-disenfranchised"" populations -- individuals who feel alienated, marginalized, or incapable of participating in STEM -- choose to make use of these opportunities, due mainly to their own self-identities. This project's focus is on three STEM-disenfranchised groups: 1) adults who have been recently released from incarceration; 2) youth who have been released from juvenile custody; and 3) refugee youth, and builds on existing science education programs.  The research team will establish the ""Alliance to Strengthen the STEM Tapestry (ASSiST)"" -- with members from academia, workforce agencies, NGOs, and government agencies -- to explore how individuals who have an identity prematurely tied to failure in science might benefit from novel interventions that promote a shift of self-identity to becoming science learners, which will then lead them to explore STEM education and job training resources that already exist. Three novel interventions will involve drama activities, story- telling, and ecological restoration projects. This bold approach is designed to help these populations interweave their diverse ways of knowing with STEM workforce, higher education, and to become science-aware citizens, which will enhance U.S. leadership in STEM. ASSisT will create a strategic plan that can be interwoven with those of other NSF INCLUDES Alliances, and identify pathways to distribute outcomes to a national level. This work will provide pathways to bring other groups that are disenfranchised and who -- if motivated and directed -- could strengthen the STEM workforce and education tapestry.<br/><br/>Investments to broaden participation in science in the USA have supported abundant programs and resources, but few individual in ""STEM-disenfranchised"" populations  -- individuals who feel alienated, marginalized, or incapable of participating in STEM -- choose to make use of these opportunities, due most significantly to their own self-identities. The proposed ""Alliance to Strengthen the STEM Tapestry (ASSisT)"" will carry out research on novel interventions that are designed to lead these individuals to avail themselves of the science education and training resources that already exist. The initial focus is on: 1) adults who have been recently released from incarceration; 2) youth who have been released from juvenile custody; and 3) refugee youth. Using a collective impact approach, ASSisT will carry out early-exploratory research to investigate how the project's novel interventions -- 1) ecological restoration, 2) story-telling/autoethnography, and 3) devised theater -- might shift participants towards self-identification and subsequent involvement with the STEM community. The Intellectual Merit of our approach is grounded in social science research, specifically, identity theory, social cognitive theory, and resilience theory. Using a one-group pretest-posttest design, qualitative research techniques will identify which elements are most critical to foster change, e.g., perceived competence in STEM subjects, congruence of self-perception with those in STEM, mastery of STEM workforce skills, and/or the importance of being a STEM-aware citizen. Broader impacts relate directly to NSF's call for greater STEM participation of women and underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic minorities with impacts on the initial 30 cohort members for this pilot project. ASSisT will: create a common agenda; recruit cohorts of each STEM-disenfranchised group; design and implement research to test novel interventions; populate a STEM opportunities map; evaluate and analyze outcomes; articulate a strategic plan that can be interwoven with those of other NSF INCLUDES Alliances; and identify pathways to disseminate outcomes and benchmarks to a national level."

PULSE Fellows have developed programs to support life sciences departments across the nation as their faculties seek to integrate V&C's educational best practices for the benefit of the next generation of scientists.  The PULSE Ambassadors program was developed to address a key need:  organizational change, such as major curricular reform by faculty, often benefits from catalysis by and support of external consultants.  The program was successfully piloted at ten diverse institutions, from community colleges to research universities and will now be expanded by developing a robust and diverse national network of trained Ambassadors who will bring on-campus workshops to a broad array of institutions of higher learning.  Network participants will be intentionally recruited to ensure institutional, ethnic, and geographic diversity in order to benefit the broadest possible array of students, to promote greater persistence among prospective biology majors, and to advance scientific literacy and the process of science among all college students taking biology courses.  The program's impacts will be evaluated with respect to successfully promoting long-term change in the departments that are engaged and components will be modified and adapted as necessary to maximize effectiveness.   <br/><br/>The PULSE Ambassadors Program is specifically designed to engage life sciences departments in critical dialogue about the faculty's vision for the implementation of V&C recommendations and goals for change over time, provide the department with the skills necessary to guide organizational change, and connect faculty with key resources of the PULSE community at large.  A robust national network of Ambassadors who are representative of the institutional and demographic diversity in our country will be built to meet the increasing demand from the community.  A diverse community of network participants and PULSE Ambassadors will be recruited and trained to support departmental engagement (Aim 1); stimulate organizational change through collaborations of Ambassador network participants and life sciences departments across the U.S. (Aim 2); and develop and implement a systemic assessment plan to evaluate and adaptively manage network activities (Aim 3).  <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

It will be held at the University of Tampa on July 20-23, 2017. The conference brings together experienced teachers from four-year and two-year colleges and younger scientists who lack teaching experience. There are two major goals. The first is to facilitate the development of the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows as teachers through sessions at the conference and by matching them with a dedicated mentor with whom they will continue to interact after the meeting. The second is to highlight teaching approaches that will increase the retention and success of students transferring from two-year to four-year colleges. A report of the conference proceedings will be published in the ASBMB Today journal, in print and online and submitted for publication to the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education (BAMBED) Journal.<br/><br/>The conference is designed to address two issues in life sciences education. The first is the lack of experience of young scientists in teaching and the second is the lower graduation rates of students transferring from two to four-year colleges. The first problem stems from the fact that most graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, in biochemistry and molecular biology, are heavily focused on their research and have little opportunity to gain knowledge about current life sciences pedagogical approaches or develop their teaching skills. Exposing these young scientists to modern approaches in the conference sessions and providing them with long-term mentors will positively impact their professional developmental and better prepare them for teaching. To address the differential graduation rates of transfer students, the conference will include community college faculty and faculty from four-year institutions. Together the faculty will discuss pedagogical methods aimed at improving the success of students.  The following topics will form the core of these discussions: 1) High impact teaching strategies; 2) Classroom undergraduate research experiences (CUREs); 3) Molecular visualization in biochemistry & molecular biology pedagogy; 4) Teaching Sanger sequencing for conceptual understanding; 5) Scientific teaching & assessment; 6) Online assessment tools; 7) Community college into 4-year college/university transitions. <br/><br/>More information about the conference is available by visiting  http://www.asbmb.org/SpecialSymposia/2017/education/program/ or by contacting the PI (Dr. Michael Carastro mcarastro@ut.edu)."

At 19,485 km2, the KNP has a long history of world-class research on savanna ecology and on adaptive management of ecosystems. The OTS programs include semester and summer courses as well as summer research experiences. In 2014, OTS received funding from the National Science Foundation and the Government of South Africa to construct the Skukuza Science Center (SSC), a research and education facility, including a lecture hall, laboratory and library, providing critical research infrastructure for international collaboration between U.S. and South African researchers and students. The SSC was completed in 2017. The current project provides essential researcher housing in close proximity to the SSC.

The current project enables OTS to construct of researcher accommodations on the SSLI campus, in close proximity to the NSF-funded SSC. Four accommodation units, each roughly 55 m2 in area, will be built from rammed earth and recycled concrete to minimize environmental impact. The design of the buildings is flexible, housing eight researchers for short stays (sharing accommodation) or four researchers for long-stay periods. This will significantly alleviate the shortage of accommodations for researchers in the KNP and will increase researcher productivity. The SSLI campus is surrounded by an electric fence to keep out dangerous animals, so researchers can safely walk from the accommodations to the SSC 24 hours a day.

The long term goal is to increase the number of AI/AN individuals who pursue faculty positions in STEM disciplines at US colleges and universities. The dearth of STEM faculty from the AI/AN group has been a long-standing national problem. Many public and private entities have made investments to improve the representation of Natives in STEM fields -- including in faculty positions -- and these investments have not made much of a difference in the percentage of students persisting in STEM among AI/AN. This project, Lighting the Pathway to Faculty Careers for Natives in STEM, will implement a 5-year pilot program at the national level, using the extensive network of individuals who are engaged in AISES national efforts or its 184 college student chapters. To continue to maintain US competiveness in the global economy, the country must utilize all of its talents in order to advance scientific knowledge and technological innovation. This project will help achieve that.<br/><br/><br/>Through the AISES national network, this project will recruit students majoring in the biological sciences, mathematical and physical sciences, geosciences, computer and information science, and engineering -- at all academic levels (undergrad, graduate and postdoc). Over the course of 5 years, it is expected that an average of 35 students will participate in the program each year. The students will be provided a strong and persistent support and mentoring system so that they can overcome barriers to the completion of their STEM degrees. Students will be provided information relevant to success in a STEM career, research experience, leadership training, role models, and other tools to help them advance to the next academic level. Frequent face-to-face and virtual meetings will expose participants to topics such as balancing life and career, effective study habits, overcoming geographic and cultural isolation, graduate school and career preparation, strategies for success as a STEM major, and writing successful graduate fellowship applications. The network of Native scholars ranging from undergraduates to senior faculty will create a supportive environment conducive to continued success in the students' pursuit of a STEM career. Participants will attend the AISES National Conference to foster strong professional and personal ties with their peers, and a conference in their chosen STEM field in order to present the results of their research. An external evaluation will assess the impact of the program on student persistence in STEM before, during, and after students' participation.

As science is increasingly done in teams, collaborations bring diversity to research. Diverse interactions can support critical thinking, problem-solving, and is a priority among STEM disciplines. By exploring a set of individual contributors that can be effect change through collective impact, this project will explore alternative approaches to broadly enhance diversity in STEM, such as sense of community and perceived program benefit. The S-TEAMS project relies on the use of sustainability as the organizing frame for the deployment of learning communities (teams) that engage deeply with active learning. Studies on the issue of underrepresentation often cite a feeling of isolation and lack of academically supportive networks with other students like themselves as major reasons for a disinclination to pursue education and careers in STEM, even as the numbers of underrepresented groups are increasing in colleges and universities across the country. The growth of sustainability science provides an excellent opportunity to include students from underrepresented groups in supportive teams working together on problems that require expertise in multiple disciplines. Participating students will develop professional skills and strengthen STEM- and sustainability-specific skills through real-world experience in problem solving and team science. Ultimately this project is expected to help increase the number of qualified professionals in the field of sustainability and the number of minorities in the STEM professions. <br/><br/>While there is certainly a clear need to improve engagement and retention of underrepresented groups across the entire spectrum of STEM education - from K-12 through graduate education, and on through career choices - the explicit focus here is on the undergraduate piece of this critical issue. This approach to teamwork makes STEM socialization integral to the active learning process. Five-member transdisciplinary teams, from disciplines such as biology, chemistry, computer and information sciences, geography, geology, mathematics, physics, and sustainability science, will work together for ten weeks in summer 2018 on real-world projects with corporations, government organizations, and nongovernment organizations. Sustainability teams with low participation by underrepresented groups will be compared to those with high representation to gather insights regarding individual and collective engagement, productivity, and ongoing interest in STEM. Such insights will be used to scale up the effort through partnership with New Jersey Higher Education Partnership for Sustainability (NJHEPS)."

The goal of the project is to expand the scope and leverage the work so as to engage students earlier in their career exploration. Specifically, the project will target undergraduates who may not be aware of the multitude of career options available to them. These include opportunities in academia, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, science communication, science policy, and technology transfer/patent law. The effort will focus on undergraduates who come from populations generally underrepresented in STEM fields, including but not limited to ethnically, racially and socioeconomically underserved communities. The grant will support educational opportunities for students at minority-serving institutions and will assess the impact of providing new opportunities to this community. The critical contributions of a diverse and inclusive community are essential to progress in all STEM fields. By promoting diversity in education, this project aims to engage undergraduate students at a point in their professional development that could enable participation in a wide range of workforce opportunities so as to advance the progress of science and national health. <br/><br/>The focus of BEST BET will be to use a collective impact framework to connect the ""BEST network"" of institutions to partners engaged in undergraduate education of students from underrepresented communities who are interested in the life sciences. The underlying premise is that career exploration focused on opportunities that go beyond physician training will enable engagement of this community of learners in the life science workforce beyond the pre-med track and keep them engaged in degree completion. Multiple strategies will be used to attain the goals of BEST BET. They are organized in the context of two major objectives roughly divided into the scope of planned activities. The first objective focuses on ""career exploration"" and offers strategies to assist partner institutions to build career and skill development capacities. The second is grounded in an enhanced experience of BEST site visits whereby undergraduates will have the opportunity to envision life as a graduate student and beyond. These strategies will likely enhance persistence to complete the baccalaureate degree and move onto doctoral programs."

Undergraduate researchers report gains in their ability to think and work like scientists and increased interest in and enjoyment of science. They are also more likely to pursue further education and careers in science and research, which drive the nation's progress and economic prosperity. Yet, research experiences are typically structured as internships, which limits the number of students who can participate. In response, colleges and universities have begun to transform their laboratory courses into scalable research experiences, called Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Students who participate in CUREs achieve many of the same gains as students who participate in research internships, but there are colleges and universities that have yet to integrate CUREs into their undergraduate curricula - especially colleges and universities that enroll significant proportions of students from under-represented and under-served backgrounds. The CURE Network 2 (CUREnet 2) will take a multi-pronged approach to build capacity for CUREs at Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) and other under-resourced colleges and universities. As a result, broader and more diverse populations of students will have access to research experiences. CUREnet 2 will also support networking and collaboration to understand what makes CUREs effective for student learning and development and to maximize the effectiveness, impact, and long-term sustainability of CURE instruction.<br/><br/>CUREnet 2 aims to support the national shift in undergraduate lab instruction toward student engagement in research. CUREnet 2 is designed in response to educational needs and according to theories of change in higher education, thereby maximizing its likelihood of impact and success. With leadership representing seven universities and colleges, including four HBCUs, CUREnet 2 will build national capacity for CURE instruction by: (1) Offering campus-based faculty professional development on CURE instruction; (2) Supporting the development of cross-institution CUREs and acquisition of resources needed to support undergraduate research; (3) Convening meetings to synthesize research in education, cognitive science, psychology, and learning sciences to understand how CUREs influence student learning and development and to plan collaborations to develop needed assessment frameworks, methods, and tools; (4) Convening meetings to identify problems and solutions for sustaining CUREs over time; (5) Improving the functionality, sustainability, and widespread use of the CUREnet website; and (6) Sharing information and resources among CURE-related networks. Ultimately, CUREnet 2 will help ensure the availability and effectiveness of research opportunities for a broad and diverse population of undergraduates early enough to make a difference in their academic and career trajectories.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/).

Synthetic biology, the design and creation of biological systems not found in nature, is a powerful and increasingly common research approach, thereby demanding its inclusion in scientific training programs. The Build-a-Genome network will host annual workshops for educators from diverse undergraduate institutions, develop teaching materials and software that allow students to engage in design and synthesis of genes and genomes, coordinate the exchange of ideas, expertise, and pedagogical results, and increase understanding of synthetic biology among the broader community. The Build-a-Genome network's approach accomplishes many of the goals of Vision and Change, including integration of research into the curriculum, exposure of students to the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the scientific process, and enhancing students' abilities to model and create new genomes and systems and to apply the process of science. Because it exemplifies biology's shift towards interdisciplinary study by integrating biology, mathematics, chemistry, and computer science, Build-a-Genome will effectively train and position students for the science jobs of the future.<br/><br/>The Build-a-Genome Network will develop and support diverse synthetic biology workflows that can be implemented at the undergraduate level including the following: synthesis of bacteriophage genomes, synthesis of yeast neochromosomes, and induced rearrangement of synthetic yeast chromosomes. Annual workshops will introduce network participants to the Build-a-Genome course workflows and the broader synthetic biology field, facilitate the collective creation of teaching modules on synthetic biology ethics, and encourage discussions about course implementation. The Build-a-Genome network will have a robust online working site where protocols will be iteratively refined, common software tools will be disseminated, assessment mechanisms and scientific expertise will be shared, and collaborations among students and institutions engaging in genome synthesis will be coordinated. Network activities will impact institutional curricula, produce lab manuals and teaching modules, broaden knowledge about synthetic biology among non-research-intensive schools, and result in presentation of research and pedagogical results at meetings and in publications. The network will include faculty from varied fields and institutional settings, including 2- and 4-year colleges, minority-serving institutions, a community lab, and a postdoctoral training program.

These programs often provide specific types of training not provided anywhere else in the undergraduate education system. The Undergraduate Field Experiences in Research Network (U-FERN) seeks to understand the impacts of these types of experiences and to build a community of practitioners working together with education researchers to share and develop effective practices that are inclusive of all students. The network will connect current knowledge about persistence of underrepresented students in Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM) with practitioners of undergraduate field experiences to harness the power of active learning as a potential for increasing participation and persistence in the field-based sciences.<br/><br/>U-FERN seeks to build a vibrant, supportive, and sustainable collaborative network that fosters effective undergraduate field experiences by: 1) identifying and sharing evidence-based models and practices for engaging a diverse range of undergraduates in effective field and marine learning experiences, 2) identifying, modifying, developing, and sharing assessment tools for understanding the impact of field and marine learning experiences on undergraduate student learning, STEM identity, and career trajectories, 3) investigating how undergraduate field experiences may help broaden the participation and retention of underrepresented and underserved students in field-based sciences such as marine ecology, ecology and geosciences, and 4) establishing undergraduate learning experiences at field stations and marine labs as ""interdisciplinary laboratories"" for researching evidence-based practices in undergraduate research, service learning, and place-based education. U-FERN will build capacity of field station and marine labs (FSMLs) and others including undergraduates in field experiences while engaging new collaborators from the social and learning sciences in program assessment and research into student learning, effective practices, and broad engagement. The wide diversity of practices implemented at field stations and marine labs creates a unique opportunity to test models of effective training in order to generate insights that can inform educational practices beyond the FSML community.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Ernesto Lujan is ""Generating the mammalian limb progenitor."" The host institution for this fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Olivier Pourquié and Clifford Tabin. <br/><br/>These NSF funds are being used to generate a type of cell, the limb progenitor, which is the basis for the limbs of animals and has the capability to give the limb its form, pattern and structure. The research focuses on the basic biology of the limb progenitor, but is also of great national interest because it will advance efforts to use the limb progenitor as the source for generating limbs de novo, with utility for amputees of war, trauma or congenital defects. To date, no one has been able to generate such a cell type. This research gives us the foundation to interrogate the true limb progenitor functionally, genomically and on the chromatin level, and provides a clear understanding of how this 3D structure is generated. <br/><br/>Aside from scientific endeavors, these funds are also being used to translate the potential of modern science to the general public and to recruit traditionally underrepresented minorities to science.  To this end, three active approaches are being utilized to increase awareness and to recruit minority students. The first is mentoring - each summer students from underrepresented groups are recruited through the Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program (SHURP), a program at Harvard that recruits underrepresented undergraduate biology students to do research in a host lab for a summer. The second is involvement in the community - each year the Fellow helps to judge poster presentations for the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) and Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS) conferences.  The third is more traditional but important - by publishing good science in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals, the Fellow is increasing the awareness of the research, providing an effective microphone for showing that modern science is on the verge of being able to generate the basis for the mammalian limb."

Selection will be made by the project leaders based on eligibility criteria that includes freshman, sophomore or associate's degree level status, a cumulative 3.0 GPA, completion of at least one undergraduate science course as well as interest and potential in research. Past cohorts have included diverse students from underrepresented groups, veterans, and community colleges.<br/><br/>A total of 30 students from schools with limited research opportunities will be trained in the program. The projects will introduce students to an integrated approach to research in computational biology; develop academic, professional, and personal skills; foster a collaborative environment encouraging discovery and innovation; expose students to areas of relevance for scientific research and development such as ethical conduct and technology transfer; and finally, equip participants to make well-informed decisions on their academic and professional career. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.<br/><br/>A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program is completed to determine student career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available at http://ccib.camden.rutgers.edu/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Benedetto Piccoli at piccoli@camden.rutgers.edu) or Co-PI (Dr. Joe Martin at joe.martin@camden.rutgers.edu)."

However, the treatments that work for mice having a condition almost never work in other animals with that condition. This apparently occurs because, even when gene pathways seem similar across species, their regulation, or network wiring, is different. Some of these changes may be caused by retrotransposon elements, whose presence has been shown to be correlated with changes in the cohesin-associated regulatory modules of human and mouse cells. Modifying sequencing technologies with special reagents has allowed us to start mapping regulatory regions in both human and mouse; results show that there is a high rate of change at regulatory sites, with only about half of the sites showing conserved sequence between human and mouse cell lines and, even where conservation is found, the expected transcription factors don't bind under similar conditions. A further complication is that most gene networks are regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs) that must bind in a particular order and combination; often this binding is at sites quite distant from the genes. Looping of the DNA at distant sites back around to bring it close, and 'locking' it in place with a regulatory protein, is one of the factors this research aims to dissect. Understanding what these regulatory element TF combinations are, what mechanisms lead to change, and how their regulatory actions can be modulated will have important applications in such areas as the treatment of disease, including better targeted therapies. This research requires strong computational skills as well as understanding the biological states of cells and the technical details of the assays; in addition to mentoring the graduate students who will take leading roles in carrying out the research, high school students will be recruited to participate in computational summer boot camps and undergraduates will be recruited to paid summer internships for immersion in the research methods and questions, with a strong emphasis on bringing more women and under-served minorities into active research experiences.   <br/><br/>In this project the PI will use recently developed methods to explore the co-binding of transcription factors with CTCF and the cohesin complex in matched human and mouse cells. These sites represent anchor regions for 3D interactions in the genome. Initial work suggests that there is extensive turnover of these sites beyond the already high turnover of cis-regulatory modules in the two genomes. This finding stands in sharp contrast to previously published work showing, at low resolution, there is a high level of conservation of the physical 3D structure between the two species. The PI has previously developed computational methods demonstrating a complex co-localization of transcription factors and shown that these patterns are conserved in mouse. These patterns were shown to maintain similar regulatory properties even with underlying sequence divergence. Here the PI will explore these conserved patterns in terms of conservation at cohesin sites in the two species. As an extension of this, the project will focus on the effect of retrotransposons in the expansion of cohesin sites in the two lineages. Finally, the project will integrate 3D structural information from ChIA-PET and HiC data to determine the effects of the gains and losses of cohesin sites on the conservation of specific loops and topological domains. This work extends from a new way of considering conservation, that of conservation of regulatory patterns instead of considering only sequence context. Because of this, the PI is able to study the entire mouse and human genomes in comparison instead of only the small fraction of the genomes comparable by sequence. As a result, the project will provide new insights into the regulatory structure of the two genomes and shed light on the aspects of gene regulatory control through looping and domain structure that would previously have been impossible to consider. Progress from this project will be available at http://boylelab.org/."

There is a significant need for nondestructive and quantitative microscopy in many biological investigations that this proposal addresses; that is, that sample preparation does not alter or deform the sample, that the details can be seen clearly and images captured with high resolution, and that the imaging process itself does not destroy the sample. Optical microscopes suffer from poor light penetration and low image resolution so sample preparation often requires slicing, fixing, staining and tagging methods that damage the samples. On the other hand, X-rays penetrate deeper in biomaterials and can image live, whole specimens nondestructively as is seen in medical applications. X-rays also have the advantage that there is minimal diffusion and scattering in biosamples, which can result in very high image resolution. However, current forms of absorption x-ray microscopy have poor contrast, low resolution and deliver high radiation doses to specimens. The proposed new generation of tomographic x-ray microscopes will provide quantitatively accurate, multi-parametric and high-resolution imaging data at low radiation dose; a first-generation prototype for a multimodality microscope will be tested during the project period. Engaging K-12 and undergraduate students in this type of interdisciplinary research will first require giving them the basic skills and knowledge for tackling problems that cross between physics, mathematics, engineering and biology. Students will be recruited from disadvantaged Houston-area school districts, and to retain their interest in STEM subjects a peer-mentoring program will be started, with special support provided for under-prepared segments of undergraduate students. To further motivate students to stick with STEM subjects organized summer camps will highlight interdisciplinary career opportunities and create research opportunities for undergraduates and high-school students. <br/><br/><br/>X-rays are of significantly higher frequency than visible light and thus offer the possibility of very high resolution and nondestructive microscopy. This project will develop methods to fully realize the potential of x-ray microscopes for bioscience applications. The project involves developing x-ray phase-contrast imaging using novel technology such as fast-pulsing x-ray tubes, photon-counting spectral detection schemes and algorithms to utilize the maximum information from each detected x-ray photons. The scientific goals of this proposal include theoretical methods, the design of a dose-efficient x-ray phase-contrast microscopy system on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, construction of the system, and the development of an additional multimodality microscope prototype. A range of biological problems will be investigated to test the benefits of the imaging system. The developed methods will be broadly disseminated and the initial prototypes will be made available to researchers working on an array of biological applications."

In the aftermath of major catastrophic hurricanes like Harvey and Irma with winds that pull trees from their roots and roofs from houses, danger quietly continues at the microscopic level in the remaining floodwaters.  This EAGER research project will advance fundamental research on sensing technology for rapid characterization of pathogenic bacteria in floodwater generated by future catastrophic events.  Covering the spectrum from hybrid materials to system, there are variables and trade-offs that can only be clearly defined through methodical, directed experimentation. With this knowledge, synergistic innovations at material, device and system architecture are pursued to affect unprecedented sensor performance. The proposed cross-disciplinary research and education program will have significant broader impacts on fluorescence spectroscopy and optical sensor technology based on heterogeneous integration of nanocomposites on silicon.  Instrument miniaturization will enable new studies correlating factors in water quality. Interactive workshops with biochemists and students will be organized to guide spectrometer development. There is a strong mentoring and training component for students at all levels at Tufts, RPI and the broader community.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop a highly sensitive frequency domain spectrometer instrument for high-throughput tracking of bacteria to quantify and identify bacteria in floodwater in real time, which significantly reduces labor, time, and cost.   The proposed work focuses on the spectral and temporal characteristics of intrinsic fluorescence and the material, device, and circuit innovations needed to detect them.    Significant technical barriers must be overcome including optical sensitivity, wavelength selectivity, environmental robustness, interference, low-noise signal amplification, and power consumption. The proposed instrument is built on enhancements from the synergistic properties of new nanocomposites that comprise an ultrasensitive device while remaining compatible with large-scale, silicon fabrication processes.  The proposed research work will benefit studies of pathogenic bacteria in floodwaters. The frequency domain spectrometer device is realized using a hybrid system-on-chip approach combining nanocomposite optoelectronic devices integrated with silicon CMOS technology for low-power, complex signal processing and bacteria classification.  Silicon integrated circuit technology enables system miniaturization, resulting in an overall reduction in power consumption and parasitic components that contribute to system noise and performance degradation. This project is well suited to an EAGER grant given the innovative aspects of the proposed research program involving the merger of self-assembled nanocomposite structures, high sensitivity analog electronics, ultra-low-power multiplexing and digitization circuitry, and emerging nanofabrication techniques. The project will realize a new class of portable fluorescence spectrometers, enabling high throughput spatial and temporal correlation of fluorescence emission data for bacteria characterization unachievable with current systems.  Motivated by the need to detect low level, RF-modulated optical signals over a wide dynamic range, this research project will explore the design of novel bipolar front-end analog circuitry with advanced features, including programmable gain, chopper stabilization, and offset compensation. Low-power circuit architectures for on-chip signal quantization and digitization will be explored to enable back-end digital processing for bacteria classification."

They can can be covalently attached to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids), or exist as small, soluble molecules. Experimental techniques for studying glycans are not as well developed as for other types of biomolecules, including a lack of computational tools. This means it can be hard to decide which glycans contribute to protein function, how they act to modulate this function, and how to modify them to optimize interesting properties. Structural records of proteins, including glycosylated proteins, are appearing in ever larger numbers in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). By selecting these glycosylated protein structures for deeper investigation with sophisticated computational tools, a knowledge-based approach to understanding the relationship between their structure, function and biological roles can be built. Knowledge based approaches allow both top-down understanding of biological roles, and bottom-up simulations of structural fluctuations at the atomic level; the latter provide very deep insight into how different glycans affect the folding and function of modified proteins. In addition, most proteins in cell membranes are glycosylated, which is important to cell recognition and signaling; more realistic modeling of biological membranes, provided by the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder toolset, will further enrich the available repertoire of membrane structure simulations. This project aims to achieve these goals by developing a comprehensive toolset for glycan modeling and simulation. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary computational structural glycobiology. In particular, this project will raise the scientific literacy of the research community through the publication of research results and workshop participation. <br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a computational toolset for modeling and simulation of glycan-containing biological systems and to acquire an in-depth and molecular-level understanding of glycan structure, dynamics, and function in the context of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and protein-glycan complexes.

Avian brood parasites, birds that provide no parental care to their offspring but instead lay their eggs in the nests of other species, represent an ideal model system for comparative analysis because brood parasitism (and the loss of parental care behavior) evolved independently seven times in five different avian families. This project will characterize patterns of genomic change in both parasitic and non-parasitic birds to test whether changes in the same specific genes and/or parallel patterns of genomic change have occurred in independent brood parasitic lineages. The results will also provide insight into other fundamental questions about genome evolution, including whether genetic changes underlying differences in behavior are most often in regulatory portions of the genome or represent structural changes to the genes themselves. In a second, related line of inquiry, the project will examine the unique evolutionary dynamics of the sex-determination chromosomes, leveraging recent research showing that specialized adaptations for exploiting particular host species are maternally inherited (passed from mother to daughter) and therefore encoded on the avian W-chromosome (analogous to the human Y-chromosome) in three different brood parasitic species. The project will also contribute to the training of scientists at various career stages including undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. A research experience for undergraduates (REU) component will provide an opportunity for two students from East Carolina University to receive training in bioinformatics at Harvard University. The project will produce high quality genome assemblies for additional bird species, supporting additional comparative analyses of genome evolution across vertebrates, and data from the project will be integrated into educational materials supporting courses in the emerging fields of molecular and population genomics.<br/><br/>Avian brood parasites and their hosts, which exhibit a spectacular diversity of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations and counter-adaptations, have served as important models for the study of coevolution. Recent discoveries of genetically divergent, host-specific matrilines within each of three different parasitic species, examples of ""adaptation without recombination"", present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of selection on the non-recombining, sex-limited chromosome. Likewise, with seven independent origins of obligate parasitism and associated loss of parental care, brood parasites offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the genome-wide consequences of a major life history transition, providing greater power for tests of genomic convergence than in other recent analyses of the genomic basis of phenotypic convergence. Results of the study will lend insight into basic questions about genome evolution, including the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency, and the manner in which integration versus modularity of genetic networks constrains the outcomes of natural selection. In addition to increasing the number of high quality genome assemblies for birds (currently available for only zebra finch and chicken) and assembling W-chromosome sequences, the proposed study will test two major hypotheses: 1) that evolutionary processes influencing the non-recombining, sex-limited W-chromosome (e.g., Hill-Robertson interference, selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking) are amplified in parasitic lineages that have maternally inherited host-specific adaptations; and 2) examining all seven parasitic clades, that the evolution of brood parasitism (and loss of parental care behavior) results in genome-wide signatures of molecular convergence and/or convergent changes in coding and/or regulatory regions associated with particular genetic pathways or functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project hosted at the University of Virginia is innovating computer-based processing to pick out these cells and analyze their movements automatically. By simplifying these tasks, this software will permit studying large quantities of data for meaningful patterns and rules governing these cells' behavior. A front-end interface and back-end modules will enable scaling these capabilities from single videos to enormous databases, limited only by available computing power. These new capabilities will help scientists uncover new insights about these critical cells, leading researchers closer to understanding similarities and differences in cell behavior among animals used to study diseases and disorders that affect millions of Americans. By bringing together biologists and engineers, this project also provides exciting new experiences for students to learn about the future possibilities at the intersection of these fields. Training high-school teachers in image processing and its applications provides this well-rounded experience to even more students.  <br/><br/>To help neuroscientists observe the behavior of neurons and glia in their native setting, this software will automate the processing and analysis of complicated movements and interactions among dozens or hundreds of cells in high-resolution microscope videos. The interface will be both scalable and efficient, permitting rapid application of video enhancement, segmentation, and tracking software to large databases of microscope videos. The content-aware enhancement will suppress clutter while preserving cell features. Time-series segmentation will identify both cell bodies and ramified processes as they move between video frames and slices of the z-stack. Transport theory will enable tracking cell movements and other changes without having to construct a complicated model that could bias the results. Plugins under development for common packages like ImageJ and Vaa3D will allow scientists to integrate these tools with existing workflows. A modular design will facilitate expanding and refining the capabilities of this software over time. These software components can track how cells such as microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells react to their environment and how these behaviors change during infection. Microscopy videos of mice, zebrafish, and other animal models will reveal insights not currently accessible due to the complicated behaviors of these cells. The collaborative nature of this project will provide valuable experiences for students embedded in the investigators? laboratories to learn more about image processing and biological applications. Training high school teachers on biological image processing during the summer will enable these teachers to share these experiences with students at schools across central Virginia and beyond. The software and research products will become available online at https://pages.shanti.virginia.edu/Neuroglia_Image_Toolkit/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multidomain proteins are mosaics of sequence fragments that encode structural or functional modules, called domains.  The modular nature of a multidomain protein is integral to its function because different constituent domains play different functional roles.  For example, in signaling proteins, some domains are responsible for the recognition and others for the transmission of an environmental signal.  These modular proteins allow cells to interact with their world, via cell-cell signaling, cellular adhesion, and cellular  migration. In human health, multidomain families are fundamental to apoptosis, innate immunity, inflammation response, and tissue repair. The multidomain architectures that are observed in nature represent a tiny fraction of possible domain combinations.  These domain combinations are the product of the mutational processes that give rise to new sequence mosaics and the selective forces that promote or discourage their retention.  In a given species, mutation and selection are both dependent on genome organization, mechanisms of DNA replication,  transcription and repair, and the interaction of the cell with its environment.  Multidomain architectures vary substantially across species, as do genomic and cellular properties.  This project exploits this comparative framework to investigate how the biology of the cell shapes the processes of multidomain evolution.  This research has the potential to transform our understanding of protein evolution by identifying multidomain design rules that may provide a foundation for predictive models linking evolution and function, with concrete applications for human health and protein engineering.  This project advances research infrastructure through the development and distribution of computational tools that may contribute to national scientific resources.  This project also contributes to building a broadly inclusive scientific work force through research experiences for women in Carnegie Mellon's undergraduate program in computational biology.<br/><br/>This project uses a three-pronged approach to investigate the universal and lineage-specific design rules of multidomain proteins.  First, computational tools will be developed to infer evolution on the domain, gene, and species levels, by modeling a multidomain  family as a set of domains that are co-evolving with the associated genes and species.  Each entity is represented by an evolutionary  tree.  The history of evolutionary events is inferred using topological comparison of the domain, gene, and species trees.   Combining  information from three levels of biological organization reveals when domain events occurred relative to events in gene, genome, and organismal evolution, providing the information required to investigate how changes in domain architecture correlate with changes in genomic and cellular properties.  Second, these methods are applied to reconstruct multidomain evolution in vertebrate and  proteobacterial  genomes, revealing shared and lineage-specific  evolutionary  patterns.   Third, comparison of these evolutionary  patterns with differences in genome organization and  cellular  machinery  in vertebrate and  proteobacterial cells will support the  inference of design rules for multidomain evolution across the tree of life.  The resulting data and computational tools will be available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/??durand/Lab/multidomain.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Understanding the process of speciation (how one distinct species becomes two distinct species) is fundamental to understanding the origins of biodiversity. Speciation is difficult to study because it cannot be directly observed within a human lifetime. One way to overcome this obstacle is to study how one species evolves across space rather than through time. One example of this approach is to look at a species that has a distribution range expanding around a barrier (e.g. a mountain range), and then determine if that species has evolved due to this break in distribution. This is known as a ring species and it is considered to be the perfect demonstration of speciation. Examples are rare but have had an outsized impact on our understanding of speciation. This research will expand our empirical understanding of ring species and in turn, the process of speciation, by rigorously documenting a promising, yet so far unappreciated ring species candidate, the Dusky-capped Flycatcher of Central and South America. This research will utilize and integrate a variety of biological collections including museum specimens, genetic resources, and audio collections of avian vocalizations. <br/> In the Dusky-capped Flycatcher, two phenotypically and genetically divergent subspecies have distinct yet overlapping elevational distributions along the southern half of the Andes, yet are connected by a continuous ring of intermediate populations in the lowlands surrounding the impermeable barrier of the northern Andes. To characterize the phenotypic variation of this potential ring species, the fellow will collect data on morphology and plumage color from a remarkable series of historical museum specimens. Importantly, every specimen is linked to archived audio recordings made at the time of their collection permitting an integrated evaluation of plumage, morphology, and vocalizations. Secondly, a reference genome and accompanying lower-coverage genomes will be assembled from existing genetic resources. These genomes will be used to test the genetic predictions of the ring species hypothesis. The impact of this research will extend beyond its intellectual contributions to the broader public through involvement and mentorship of students from underrepresented groups. The results of this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications as well as a public education campaign through the fellow's host institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific progress calls for software with several qualities rarely found together. Ideally, scientific software: 1) is open-source (providing the underlying code); 2) gives conceptual and methodological guidance (orienting the user and helping them make decisions); 3) is flexible (allowing many options); 4) is interactive (showing the results of each stage of the analysis as it is completed); 5) can be expanded/updated easily and quickly; and 6) provides explicit documentation of the analyses run (making it easy to reproduce the results). The software to be produced in this project responds directly to these needs. It will be an example of an innovative way to make new scientific methods accessible to a broad audience of researchers, far beyond the specialists of a particular subfield. It targets a large user base of biologists and natural resource managers, and also will be of interest to programmers, educators, and students. This software should lead to better estimates of species ranges, important to interests as diverse as conservation biology, the study of invasive species and diseases passed to humans from insects and wildlife. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in computer coding. In addition to the software itself, the researchers will produce scientific publications and online webinars that document and explain its use.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will greatly expand the software Wallace for the burgeoning field of niche/distributional modeling and related fields. Such models estimate environmental suitability for a species, indicating their potential geographic distribution for a wide variety of scientific studies. Currently, researchers struggle to follow advances and achieve a nimble uptake of new ideas and techniques. To improve this situation, the Wallace software provides a modular platform offering customizable workflows through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Taking advantage of the modular nature of Wallace, the researchers will coordinate with many external partners to add diverse cutting-edge functionalities. The project will: 1) produce a comprehensive framework for modeling based on occurrence data that document the presence of a species; 2) include techniques that take advantage of repeated sampling; 3) allow seamless user up/download and customizable workflows via online and local implementations; and 4) grow the user community. Eventually, this approach could be scaled-up, allowing high-quality modeling for thousands of species. Wallace also will serve as an example for the development of scientific software in other disciplines. The results of the project will be made available at: https://wallaceecomod.github.io/"

As the world's largest collection of chytrids, it serves as a resource to the research community by providing cultures to biologists in both academic and industrial settings, resulting in biological insights found in over 200 published articles.  Although these microscopic fungi reproduce with a swimming spore they occur in soils as well as in fresh and saline waters; they fill important ecological roles as parasites and also by degrading substrates such as pollen and other plant material, insect exoskeletons, hair, etc.  Chytrids are notorious for their role in the global decline of amphibians; the collection contains over 180 strains of the amphibian pathogen from around the world.  This collection was developed and maintained by Joyce Longcore at the University of Maine without institutional support for more than 25 years.  To safeguard the chytrid collection, it will be moved to the University of Michigan's recently remodeled Research Museums Complex where it will be stored in a state-of-the-art cryopreservation facility and managed by the University's Herbarium unit. The collection will be a resource for the scientific community involved in research on chytrids and their function in terrestrial and aquatic systems.<br/><br/>Chytrid fungi require special growth and maintenance conditions, because they are aquatic fungi that reproduce with flagellated, wall-less zoospores. Most of the University of Maine collection is cryopreserved, making inter-institutional transfer in a frozen state possible, however, approximately 12% of the collection is routinely transferred in liquid cultures, because it has not been amendable to freezing. The first goal of the project is to move the collection in Maine to the Research Museums Complex in Ann Arbor where fungal strains will be stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.  Cryopreservation in the vapor of liquid nitrogen stabilizes samples at -193 degrees Celsius; because inadvertent exposure to temperatures above -80 affects the viability of frozen cultures, storage in liquid nitrogen is safer than storage in typical ultralow freezers with electrical compressors.  A second goal of this project is to develop methods to freeze and secure the remaining 12% of strains that have been resistant to cryopreservation.  To verify taxonomic assignments of the culture collection and to better characterize its contents, DNA barcoding will be performed by sequencing and making accessible the 18S and ITS ribosomal RNA gene regions.  Finally, this project will transform the collection into a public resource by making additional data about the strains accessible online and improving the distribution and maintenance of the cultures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While nearly all cells within an organism have the same DNA, they can exhibit very different characteristics as different genes are turned on, or expressed, within them.  Transcription factor interactions, comprising regulatory networks, control which genes are expressed, and thus the dynamics of these interactions across cells, conditions and organisms are a critical feature of proper biological functioning.  To date, however, most existing knowledge about regulatory networks is static in nature: for nearly all organisms, transcription factor interactions are known under only a small number of conditions of interest. To help fill this gap and begin to uncover the dynamic nature of transcriptional regulatory networks, novel computational approaches will be developed to predict and compare condition-specific transcriptional interactions within an organism and varying transcriptional interactions across organisms.  Software for these tasks will be released and made available to the broader scientific community. Additionally, significant new outreach efforts will be undertaken to recruit a diverse group of students to take part in this research.<br/><br/>More specifically, new computational approaches will be developed to uncover and differentially analyze condition-specific and cross-organism variation both in regulatory interactions between transcription factors and their genomic targets, as well as in interactions amongst regulators themselves, as these interactions are a central mechanism by which regulatory specificity is achieved.  The approaches will leverage large numbers of transcription factors with known binding specificities, existing chromatin accessibility data across numerous conditions that reveal which portions of a genome are accessible to be bound by transcription factors in those conditions, and comparative analysis of multiple closely related fully sequenced organisms.

Cilia move in regular, rhythmic patterns in order to transport materials outside the cells. These movements of the cilia are important at every stage of life, from early embryonic development to reproduction and regular healthy maintenance; in short, healthy cilia are a critical component of overall health of an organism. Consequently, when cilia move abnormally, numerous debilitating conditions can result, encompassing disorders ranging from developmental shortcomings in the embryo to adult pathologies such as infertility and lung scarring. Therefore, the key question this proposal seeks to answer is: by observing the motion of cilia, is it possible to predict whether the morphology or behavior is abnormal, and if so, whether that particular abnormality is associated with a specific condition? The answer to this question has implications not only in human health, but also in building fundamental knowledge of the biology around how cilia are constructed and maintained. To address this question, we are building the CiliaWeb platform, which will include new algorithms for analyzing videos of cilia and shedding light on the statistics of ciliary motion. The algorithms will take advantage of the regular back-and-forth movements of cilia and be built to incorporate crowdsourced feedback from users to improve the models of ciliary motion. As its name implies, CiliaWeb will be internet-accessible for researchers and clinicians to upload datasets, conduct analyses, and visualize results. The ultimate goal of CiliaWeb is to provide a standardized platform for ciliary motion analysis that can be reproduced and validated by others, encouraging collaboration and catalyzing new discoveries in fundamental cilia research as well as connections to health and well-being.<br/><br/><br/>Cilia are microscopic hairs that protrude from eukaryotic cells and are critical components in development, reproduction, and homeostasis. Cilia beat in synchronous waves to generate fluid flow and clear particulates; disruptions of these motions result in a spectrum of pathologies. However, no quantitative, reproducible, and validated method exists for assessing ciliary motion from high-speed videomicroscopy. Without such a method, beat pattern phenotype cannot be used to conclusively advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of cilia (construction and maintenance), nor the precise role of beat pattern in organismal health (examples being signaling, development, fertility). This proposal aims to create the CiliaWeb framework to establish an objective measure of motion phenotypes, enable new lines of inquiry into biophysical mechanisms of ciliary motion and discover the biological roles of specific motion phenotypes, as well as make possible cross-institutional collaborations, large-scale genotype-phenotype association studies, and longitudinal biomedical studies. The CiliaWeb platform will incorporate tightly-integrated and openly-available tools for processing ciliary motion, including: a novel unsupervised dynamic texture segmentation algorithm for automatically identifying cilia in high-speed digital videos; a hierarchical encoding scheme for quantifying ciliary motion at multiple spatiotemporal scales; a crowdsourcing module to solicit targeted feedback on the learned motion patterns that are fully interactive and automated. CiliaWeb will contribute methodological advancements in computational bioimaging and establish baseline data through the release of open source code and validated datasets, in addition to hands-on outreach and training for students in the form of workshops and hackathons.

Avian brood parasites, birds that provide no parental care to their offspring but instead lay their eggs in the nests of other species, represent an ideal model system for comparative analysis because brood parasitism (and the loss of parental care behavior) evolved independently seven times in five different avian families. This project will characterize patterns of genomic change in both parasitic and non-parasitic birds to test whether changes in the same specific genes and/or parallel patterns of genomic change have occurred in independent brood parasitic lineages. The results will also provide insight into other fundamental questions about genome evolution, including whether genetic changes underlying differences in behavior are most often in regulatory portions of the genome or represent structural changes to the genes themselves. In a second, related line of inquiry, the project will examine the unique evolutionary dynamics of the sex-determination chromosomes, leveraging recent research showing that specialized adaptations for exploiting particular host species are maternally inherited (passed from mother to daughter) and therefore encoded on the avian W-chromosome (analogous to the human Y-chromosome) in three different brood parasitic species. The project will also contribute to the training of scientists at various career stages including undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow. A research experience for undergraduates (REU) component will provide an opportunity for two students from East Carolina University to receive training in bioinformatics at Harvard University. The project will produce high quality genome assemblies for additional bird species, supporting additional comparative analyses of genome evolution across vertebrates, and data from the project will be integrated into educational materials supporting courses in the emerging fields of molecular and population genomics.<br/><br/>Avian brood parasites and their hosts, which exhibit a spectacular diversity of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations and counter-adaptations, have served as important models for the study of coevolution. Recent discoveries of genetically divergent, host-specific matrilines within each of three different parasitic species, examples of ""adaptation without recombination"", present a unique opportunity to examine the effects of selection on the non-recombining, sex-limited chromosome. Likewise, with seven independent origins of obligate parasitism and associated loss of parental care, brood parasites offer an unparalleled opportunity to explore the genome-wide consequences of a major life history transition, providing greater power for tests of genomic convergence than in other recent analyses of the genomic basis of phenotypic convergence. Results of the study will lend insight into basic questions about genome evolution, including the relative importance of determinism versus historical contingency, and the manner in which integration versus modularity of genetic networks constrains the outcomes of natural selection. In addition to increasing the number of high quality genome assemblies for birds (currently available for only zebra finch and chicken) and assembling W-chromosome sequences, the proposed study will test two major hypotheses: 1) that evolutionary processes influencing the non-recombining, sex-limited W-chromosome (e.g., Hill-Robertson interference, selective sweeps, genetic hitchhiking) are amplified in parasitic lineages that have maternally inherited host-specific adaptations; and 2) examining all seven parasitic clades, that the evolution of brood parasitism (and loss of parental care behavior) results in genome-wide signatures of molecular convergence and/or convergent changes in coding and/or regulatory regions associated with particular genetic pathways or functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellow, Kristin A. Moore, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Jeffrey C. Cameron at the University of Colorado. The fellow's research aims to increase our understanding of a fundamental question regarding life, namely, how do cells with varying amounts of DNA ensure that their descendants receive the correct amount of DNA? Control of genetic inheritance, the faithful copying and division of DNA, is an essential process for all living organisms. Disruptions that alter cell DNA content can result in abnormal development and disease. For example, in humans one additional copy of chromosome 21 results in Down syndrome. Historically, it has been assumed that bacteria contain a single circular chromosome. However, recent studies indicate that many bacterial species contain multiple chromosomes, and that the number of copies can even vary between individual cells in a population. Furthermore, the consequences of variable DNA content in bacteria are unknown, even though bacteria that are important medically, ecologically, and industrially, have all been shown to have multiple chromosome copies. The fellow's research aims to bolster our understanding of the extent, causes, and significance of chromosome number variation in bacteria. <br/><br/>This research aims to identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate genome copy number as well as the physiological and evolutionary consequences of polyploidy (multiple identical chromosomes) in a phylogenetically diverse subset of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria, a phylum comprised of photosynthetic microbes that play critical roles in many biogeochemical cycles, can be either monoploid (one copy of chromosomes per cell) or polyploid (2-20 copies per cell).  The natural variation in chromosome number, fully sequenced genomes, genetically tractable model species, and an extensive synthetic biology toolkit make cyanobacteria an ideal system to study the causes and consequences of polyploidy in bacteria. Over the course of this multidisciplinary project, the fellow will gain experience in advanced microscopy, computational biology, synthetic biology, ecology, and mathematical modeling. The fellow will also gain experience mentoring students from under-represented groups that will be involved in the research. Additionally, a unique set of teaching modules will be created based on the fellow's studies that will provide educators with real-world projects and data that they can incorporate into their own classrooms."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Laurel Yohe is ""evolution and development of chemosensory systems in tetrapods"". Most animals have only a single smell system for processing chemical signals that help them find food and mates, as well as avoid predators and noxious substances. This fellow is investigating the reasons why tetrapods developed a secondary olfactory sense system in their nose called the vomeronasal system. Explanations for why two smell systems evolved in the first place are incomplete and confounded by speculation. To complicate the story further, the vomeronasal system has been reduced or lost in many lineages independently. The fellow will apply innovative and non-destructive staining methods to museum specimens to quantify and characterize the variation in these two olfactory systems' function, from the developing nasal cavities of embryos to fully developed noses of species that possess these two systems, including those species that have lost the vomeronasal system. Understanding how these two systems evolved, and why the vomeronasal system is lost in some species, can help our understanding of chemosensory evolution and development specifically, but can also help us to understand sensory evolution in general. This study will prepare the fellow for a career as an independent research scientist, through the exposure and training of pioneering methods and new disciplines that will help shape the future research program of the fellow.<br/><br/>The majority of what is known about the molecular and developmental mechanisms of smell comes from model organisms. This project applies new staining and imaging methods to both adult and embryonic non-model organism museum specimens to test longstanding hypotheses on why selection on the vomeronasal system has relaxed in some tetrapods but remains well conserved in others. First, the fellow will use a non-destructive staining technology to a diversity of museum specimens to quantify the sizes and volumes of different olfactory structures in groups of organisms that are known to have differences in vomeronasal function. From this data, the fellow can test hypotheses for why some species have the vomeronasal system and some do not, such as having an aquatic lifestyle or being diurnal. Second, the fellow will perform a comparative embryology study of nasal cavity development in groups of organisms where variation in function exists, identifying key ontogenetic stages in which vestigialization may occur. Third, at the stages in which variation is thought to occur, the fellow will apply comparative transcriptomics to identify the molecular basis for this variation. The project will establish a new program that links students from New Haven's community colleges to participate in research projects at Yale. This outreach exposes students that often do not have direct access to research opportunities to hands-on learning activities and research experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop convenes interdisciplinary experts and trainees to brainstorm innovative and integrated approaches that create a positive feedback loop between instrument developers, computational experts, and biologists to transform the way imaging technologies are developed and deployed. The workshop is focused on discussing approaches that 1) increase access and training opportunities in cutting-edge imaging instrumentation as it is being developed; 2) foster interdisciplinary collaboration and training between microscopists, computational imaging specialists, and biologists to advance innovation and discovery; and 3) promote the development of complementary platforms that enable unprecedented imaging across scales. <br/><br/>The 2-day workshop is held at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, bringing together national and international key players, who work at the interface between biology, engineering, physics, and computation. The workshop includes keynote speakers, special sessions on ""Building and disseminating new microscopy methods"", ""Computation for generating image data and their analysis"", ""Centers for interdisciplinary collaborations and training,"" and a podium discussion on the creation of new centers that increase access and training in cutting-edge imaging instrumentation as it is being developed. With the goal of engaging the next generation of scientists and engineers working at the interface between several disciplines, a poster and additional discussion session will provide opportunities for graduate students and postdocs to present their work and give input on components that are currently missing or underrepresented in their training and that can be met by interdisciplinary imaging centers.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This project focuses on how a species of Puerto Rican lizard, Anolis cristatellus, has adapted to climate and land-use changes over the last 120 years. The fellow will use specimens collected since 1890 to study how scale-size and gene-frequencies in this lizard species have changed through time. Scale-size is a potentially important trait for tropical lizards, because large scales are thought to reduce the amount of water that is lost through the skin due to evaporation (i.e. evaporative water loss, or EWL). Therefore, lizards in drier habitats are predicted to have larger scales than lizards in wetter habitats. The fellow will measure scale-size variation from contemporary and historical museum specimens to see if A. cristatellus scale-size variation over the last 120 years tracks drying conditions due to climate and land-use changes in Puerto Rico. The fellow will also use genomic approaches to identify regions of the A. cristatellus genome that are under natural selection. This research will improve our understanding of how ectotherms respond to historical changes in climate and land-use, and will facilitate more accurate predictions of their responses to future changes. <br/><br/>The research will build links between the fields of eco-physiology, genomics of adaptation, and climate change biology while harnessing the power of collections-based research. The fellow will test for relationships between scale morphology and climate, and adaptive allele frequencies and climate, in both contemporary and historical samples. To determine genes that are under climate-mediated selection, the fellow will use ecological association analysis and climate layers to analyze exome-capture data. For genes that are under climate-mediated selection, the fellow will use a single-base extension protocol to assay adaptive alleles in historical specimens. The fellow will form a collaboration between the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and UC Berkeley's Pre-College Upward Bound Summer Program to bring museum-based education and mentorship to high-school students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Results from these studies will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared through presentations at scientific meetings."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Most information about extinct animals comes exclusively from their bones. Researchers often specialize, focusing on one part of the skeleton, for example, the skulls, teeth, or feet. However, bones neither develop nor function independently, and studying them in isolation may hide important information about underlying genetic, developmental, or functional processes that affect multiple bones at once a process called integration. Bones that are tightly integrated with others are more resistant to change (evolution) than those that are not, meaning they may reveal very different aspects of an animal's behavior and/or its evolutionary past. Knowing how integration works is therefore essential to interpreting the fossil record. Integration will be investigated by comparing the skeletons of marsupial and non-marsupial (placental) mammals who are not related but who are similar in behavior and appearance. This includes gliders (sugar gliders and flying squirrels), burrowers (wombats and ground hogs), swimmers (yapoks and otters) and leapers (quokkas and jerboas). Comparing the entire skeleton of these species can show whether similarities likely arise from the same genetic and developmental machinery or whether skeletons change in different ways to produce the same effect. Three-dimensional scans and high resolution photographs will further reveal which parts of the mammalian skeleton best reflect behavior (ex. movement, diet) and which best show genetic relationships across species. Over 6,500 bone scans will be created and shared publicly. These will help preserve fragile museum specimens, can be 3D printed, provide teaching and training material to others, and will be incorporated into community programs and high school workshops operated by the fellow and her mentees.<br/><br/>This project investigates how intrinsic constraints express as adult covariation by comparing skeletal-wide integration patterns between functionally convergent species and derived outgroups. Research foci are two-fold. The first assesses the universality of therian skeletal-wide integration patterns, with the null expectation that they are the same for all taxa. The second focuses on whether within-skeleton integration patterns appear functionally or phylogenetically structured, with the null expectation that they do not. This project advances evolutionary theory by showing how intrinsic constraints limit the paths by which specialist morphologies arise. It will further show the value of taxonomic inferences made from differentially fragmented fossils and which trait combinations best reflect phylogeny and which behavior.  The fellow will receive training in 3D data collection and processing, geomorphometric analyses, evolutionary modeling, and quantitative genetics. She will also develop a workshop in 3D morphometrics, present at scientific meetings, produce multiple publications, and mentor student researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the aftermath of major catastrophic hurricanes like Harvey and Irma with winds that pull trees from their roots and roofs from houses, danger quietly continues at the microscopic level in the remaining floodwaters.  This EAGER research project will advance fundamental research on sensing technology for rapid characterization of pathogenic bacteria in floodwater generated by future catastrophic events.  Covering the spectrum from hybrid materials to system, there are variables and trade-offs that can only be clearly defined through methodical, directed experimentation. With this knowledge, synergistic innovations at material, device and system architecture are pursued to affect unprecedented sensor performance. The proposed cross-disciplinary research and education program will have significant broader impacts on fluorescence spectroscopy and optical sensor technology based on heterogeneous integration of nanocomposites on silicon.  Instrument miniaturization will enable new studies correlating factors in water quality. Interactive workshops with biochemists and students will be organized to guide spectrometer development. There is a strong mentoring and training component for students at all levels at Tufts, RPI and the broader community.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop a highly sensitive frequency domain spectrometer instrument for high-throughput tracking of bacteria to quantify and identify bacteria in floodwater in real time, which significantly reduces labor, time, and cost.   The proposed work focuses on the spectral and temporal characteristics of intrinsic fluorescence and the material, device, and circuit innovations needed to detect them.    Significant technical barriers must be overcome including optical sensitivity, wavelength selectivity, environmental robustness, interference, low-noise signal amplification, and power consumption. The proposed instrument is built on enhancements from the synergistic properties of new nanocomposites that comprise an ultrasensitive device while remaining compatible with large-scale, silicon fabrication processes.  The proposed research work will benefit studies of pathogenic bacteria in floodwaters. The frequency domain spectrometer device is realized using a hybrid system-on-chip approach combining nanocomposite optoelectronic devices integrated with silicon CMOS technology for low-power, complex signal processing and bacteria classification.  Silicon integrated circuit technology enables system miniaturization, resulting in an overall reduction in power consumption and parasitic components that contribute to system noise and performance degradation. This project is well suited to an EAGER grant given the innovative aspects of the proposed research program involving the merger of self-assembled nanocomposite structures, high sensitivity analog electronics, ultra-low-power multiplexing and digitization circuitry, and emerging nanofabrication techniques. The project will realize a new class of portable fluorescence spectrometers, enabling high throughput spatial and temporal correlation of fluorescence emission data for bacteria characterization unachievable with current systems.  Motivated by the need to detect low level, RF-modulated optical signals over a wide dynamic range, this research project will explore the design of novel bipolar front-end analog circuitry with advanced features, including programmable gain, chopper stabilization, and offset compensation. Low-power circuit architectures for on-chip signal quantization and digitization will be explored to enable back-end digital processing for bacteria classification."

The study of PPIs is very important to understand protein biological functions as the biological functions of almost all proteins are provided by specific, non-covalent interactions with other molecules. The identification of interacting partners and interaction sites of protein complexes or aggregates will shed light on the elucidation of biological process mechanisms. This instrumentation project will provide opportunities for students to be trained in interdisciplinary research involving analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and instrumentation. The proposed instrument for biological research will first be used for the study of UV-induced apoptotic signaling pathways. Following instrument construction and software training, many other biological research groups in structural and molecular biology at Ohio University will have access to the developed instrument. The instrument will also serve as a prototype instrument for commercialization, enabling dissemination to the biological research community. It is expected that the proposed research will benefit the research communities of structural biology, molecular biology, and drug discovery.<br/><br/>      Cross-linking mass spectrometry (MS) has become a useful technique for mapping protein-protein interactions and elucidating protein networks in living cells. However, several experimental obstacles limit the usefulness of cross-linking MS, including difficulty in the identification of cross-linked peptides in the complex mixture, the complexity of the fragmentation patterns of cross-linked peptide ions and the inability to quantify cross-links. This project proposes a new approach using electrochemistry (EC)-assisted cross-linking MS for probing protein-protein interactions in vivo, based on an electrochemical cross-linking reagent, diselenide [succinimidyl propionate] (SSP).  Following online digestion, the cross-linked protein complexes will undergo capillary electrolysis (CE) separation, online EC reduction and online MS detection. The EC reduction provides a novel way to quickly identify and quantify cross-links based on the reduction current (also on MS signal), significantly reducing time required for data analysis by more than one order of magnitude. The online EC reduction takes seconds, which is much faster than hours required in chemical reduction. Furthermore, EC reduction yields easily identifiable linear peptides, facilitating MS/MS identification of cross-link structures for pinpointing out the interaction sites in the protein complexes."

Whether in soils, waters, human guts, or the atmosphere, prokaryotes affect, if not control, all life-sustaining processes on Earth, but how these microbes interact with and change their environment is not fully understood. Current incomplete understanding is, at least in part, due to the fact that the great majority of microorganisms resist cultivation in the laboratory, i.e., they represent the uncultivable majority, and thus, cannot be studied efficiently. In the past few years, there has been an explosion of culture-independent genomic techniques (a.k.a. metagenomics), which allow the analysis of microorganisms and their communities in their natural habitat by sequencing their entire genomes or transcriptomes, bypassing the need for lab cultivation. However, the development of computational tools and algorithms to analyze metagenomic data is lagging behind developments in sequencing technologies. To advance the understanding of the uncultivable majority of microorganisms, and take full advantage of the investment of society in genomic technologies, new quantitative approaches are needed. The goals of this project are: 1) to develop new computational tools that fulfill critical research needs and thus, help scientists understand the composition, functions and values of the microbial communities, and 2) to train faculty from undergraduate colleges, including community colleges, in new metagenomics techniques, which are positioned at the interface of microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology, a pivotal area of contemporary research and education that is inadequately covered in traditional curricula. Therefore, these activities are expected to provide important infrastructure for training the future workforce and to facilitate contemporary research. <br/><br/>The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) has been successfully used to catalogue and study the diversity of microorganisms for the last two decades. This work has been facilitated by the development of dedicated resources (databases and tool repositories) such as the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu). However, rRNA gene-based studies have important limitations that techniques based on genome sequences do not. For instance, the genomic techniques can better resolve microbial communities at the levels where the SSU rRNA gene provides inadequate resolution, namely the species and finer levels, and catalogue whole-genome diversity and fluidity, which are relevant for nutrient cycling, bioremediation efforts, and emergence of microbial antibiotic resistance. This project seeks to develop tools that overcome several of the limitations of the rRNA gene-based approaches and allow the efficient analysis of microbiomes. Robust implementations of both well-accepted existing methods, such as genome-aggregate average nucleotide identity (gANI) for delineating closely-related species and strains, along with newer methods, including the recently developed Nonpareil method for estimating the coverage of a microbial community obtained by a metagenomic dataset, and MyTaxa method for examining horizontal gene transfer events between microbial lineages will be provided. The overarching objective is to develop the genome equivalent of the RDP that will enable the scientific community to perform classification and diversity studies at the genome level."

These relationships are represented as an evolutionary tree, or, more generally, a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) when horizontal or vertical transmission of genetic material is modeled. The proposed project investigates the popular Bayesian approach to phylogenetic inference. Currently, all popular software packages for Bayesian inference utilize Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The problem is that these algorithms can take months to converge on large inference problems.The project's aim is to develop parallel algorithms for MCMC that are suitable for use in a modern cluster compute environment, such as Amazon.com's EC2 service.  To ensure broader impacts of this work, the software, along with a user's manual and tutorial, will be open-sourced and the PIs will make special effort in recruiting students from underrepresented groups<br/><br/>For a phylogenetic inference algorithm to scale to thousands of organisms, parallelization is mandatory. For example, one idea that the project will expore is the so-called Bayesian Forest (BF) approach.  In the BF approach, the MCMC algorithm maintains not one tree or DAG, but dozens, hundreds, or thousands of trees or DAGs at the same time, where all of them work together and share information with one another as the algorithm runs.  This tends to avoid problems associated with converging to poor, locally optimal solutions because as long as one tree/DAG has avoided a problem configuration, over time, that tree/DAG can pull the entire forest away from the poor solution.  Crucially, since the most expensive computations over the individual trees/DAGs are independent of one another, it is easy to send them to different machines.  The project will also consider distributed algorithms for challenging variants of the problem, such as  multi-loci data sets and vertical and horizontal transmission of genetic material, as well as co-estimation of gene and species trees. All software, along with a user's manual and tutorial, will be open-sourced.  The project web page will be available at http://cmj4.web.rice.edu/phylogenetics."

This collection consists of an estimated 472,000 plant specimens, making it the largest herbarium in Louisiana, and among the largest in the Southeastern U.S.  In early 2017, the ULM administration determined that the university could no longer support the collection and that it would need to be relocated. The ULM collection will join the approximately one million specimens already in BRIT's herbarium where they would be housed in climate-controlled conditions to preserve them for scientific research. This award will ensure that the ULM collection is safely transferred and cared for. BRIT will collaborate with staff at the Louisiana State University Herbarium (LSU) to select approximately 60,000 specimens that will be returned to Louisiana and housed at the LSU Herbarium. The ULM specimens document the natural heritage of Louisiana and surrounding regions and can provide valuable insight into understanding critical issues affecting the region, including extreme weather, land subsidence, wetlands loss, and ocean acidification. By preserving the collection at BRIT and repatriating selected specimens to LSU, the project will ensure that the specimens remain available to scientists, resource managers, and students for generations to come. <br/><br/>The estimated 472,000 plant specimens at the ULM herbarium constitute an expansive resource documenting more than 99% of the vascular flora of Louisiana. To rescue this valuable collection from destruction, BRIT will transport 336 herbarium cabinets in trailers equipped with freezers capable of reaching -29°C, sufficiently cold to eradicate any insect pests. The BRIT herbarium will retain the majority of collections in a self-contained building, with climate controlled to 18°C and 55% relative humidity. Any necessary cabinet and specimen repairs will be conducted, and specimens inventoried. BRIT will serve as a staging facility to repatriate a synoptic set of specimens to Louisiana State University (LSU) that will address geographic, conservation, and taxonomic gaps in holdings at LSU and other Louisiana herbaria. Any other duplicates will be sent to other herbaria on exchange, with priority to herbaria of the southeastern U.S. Copies of all image files and specimen metadata will be given to BRIT for incorporation into their specimen data digital repository. The project will ensure that this collection can continue to serve as an invaluable resource for floristic knowledge of Louisiana."

Research on these questions has been challenged by the relative inaccessibility of the signal recordings and their associated physical specimens. This project will meet this challenge by partnering together multiple biological research collections and the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, the world's largest scientific archive of animal signal recordings. Collectively, these institutions will co-curate and make accessible digitized and vouchered recordings of the communication signals of birds, frogs, fish and insects, and will establish direct and transparent links across collections between physical voucher specimens and their digitized recordings. This project will make accessible digital audio recordings of animal signals that can be used to address a host of scientific questions, including the responses of animals to anthropogenic noise and other human activities. By providing a useful co-curation system and encouraging collection of recordings along with physical specimens, this project will have a transformative influence on the way that researchers collect and use biological specimens in the future, and will serve as a useful model for collections facing similar co-curation challenges. <br/><br/>This project will also provide materials for extensive educational outreach at all age levels, and will have significant conservation impacts because the digitized material will contribute directly to our ability to assess and monitor biodiversity. Finally, this project will expand biological collection methods and help train the ""next generation"" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers.

The RHIP-5D system will provide a novel capability for rapid hyperspectral imaging. The RHIP-5D will be implemented on a confocal microscope and will allow imaging of organelles and sub-cellular structures with high molecular sensitivity, as well as the ability to detect many different molecules simultaneously. This approach will advance new molecular imaging studies aimed at measuring crucial functional information in cells and tissues that was previously inaccessible. Once complete, the microscope system will enable breakthrough studies of high-speed events at the biosystems level, including processes controlling cell signaling cascades, seagrass infection, microparticle dynamics, and cellular biomechanics. The University of South Alabama will host training sessions for scientific researchers outside the University on the use of this novel microscope system, further establishing the University as a center for imaging and biotechnology development. In addition, this system will provide unique BioImaging capabilities to lower Alabama and the Gulf Coast region, and will serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaborations within the State of Alabama and the nation.<br/><br/>The RHIP-5D system is made possible by a novel form of imaging that scans the fluorescence excitation spectrum. Previous hyperspectral imaging approaches have provided increased sensitivity and specificity by acquiring spectroscopic data for every pixel in the image, but it has been difficult to implement hyperspectral imaging on fluorescence microscope systems at high speeds. This is because previous hyperspectral approaches that scan the fluorescence emission spectrum can result in significant (>90%) signal loss. By contrast, the excitation-scanning approach employed by the RHIP-5D system will allow the entire fluorescence emission signal to be detected, providing a 30-100X increase in signal strength. This novel approach has the potential to transform biological microscopy studies."

Natural history collections contain substantial amounts of untapped information concerning North American biodiversity that is largely unavailable to non-scientists. The digital revolution that is allowing the integration of photographic images and associated information permits the availability of information on species diversity along with the criteria used to separate species to anyone with internet access. Moreover, the end-user of such information can make important contributions to the knowledge of our fauna if they are given appropriate information on methods used to characterize species. <br/><br/>The Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC) includes a major North American moth collection, with extensive representation of moth species from much of the United States, especially the mountain forest habitats of the American southwest. The CUIC Lepidoptera holdings total 1.7 million specimens and are currently stored as four separate, parallel collections. These specimens will be integrated into a single comprehensive moth collection reflecting modern classification and up-to-date nomenclature. The currently parallel collections, housed under cramped and partially unsafe storage conditions, will be rehoused in expanded cabinetry incorporating archival storage materials, ensuring long-term preservation of the specimens and full access to all material by researchers. These tasks will be conducted by undergraduate student employees who will receive training in curation and insect taxonomy. Approximately 8700 adult specimens representing at least 2800 species of North American moths will be photographed along with their associated microscope slide-mounted genitalic preparations. These images with associated label data will be uploaded onto the NSF supported Morphbank website, making all images and information available for moth identification or taxonomic description. Approximately 1500 of the specimens in this special collection have never been assigned to a known, described species, supporting their status as representatives of undescribed, cryptic species.  An M.S. graduate student will conduct thesis research that emphasizes the use of moth anatomical characters for species discrimination and description. This student will also develop short educational videos that explain various aspects of moth taxonomy, including how to collect moths, how to dissect moths, and how to identify and interpret the morphological characters used for moth identification and taxonomic description. These videos will target knowledgeable amateurs of all ages, thereby integrating the substantial community of citizen scientists into a larger effort to understand our moth fauna. The adult and genitalic moth images will be made available at Morphbank (www.morphbank.net) and shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).

CRFS is located within Capitol Reef National Park, an area preserved because of its exposed geologic strata and associated variety of habitats that are home to a rich diversity of living organisms. Established in 2008 under a cooperative agreement between UVU and the National Park Service, CRFS embodies a unique partnership between a university and a national park. A strategic plan for CRFS will enhance the utilization of this station for undergraduates who are learning and conducting faculty-mentored research in a variety of STEM disciplines. The majority of students who visit CRFS are from UVU, an open-enrollment institution committed to inclusivity and access. The university serves a dual mission as both a regional, comprehensive university and as a community college. UVU is in the uncommon position of having the field station resources of a comprehensive university while serving a high proportion of community-college-going students who are underrepresented at field stations across the nation. Over 40% of UVU students are either first-generation college students or ethnic minorities. Strategic planning will enhance this field station's ability to provide meaningful experiences to a diverse group of individuals. Further, in addition to benefiting UVU undergraduates, the proposed planning process will lead to a better understanding of field stations, like CRFS, that are located in U.S. national parks and run through university partnerships.<br/><br/>As part of the planning effort, UVU will conduct a survey among other similar field stations to determine how they maximize opportunities and minimize challenges associated with university-national park partnerships. Selected survey participants will be invited to a conference at CRFS to meet with UVU faculty and Capitol Reef National Park personnel. CRFS staff will then visit the field stations of key conference participants, some of whom will be hired as consultants. The consultants will assist in the development of CRFS's strategic plan. The products of the strategic planning process will include: 1) a written 5-year plan for research, education, and conservation activities at the station; 2) a document detailing what additional facilities and infrastructure are needed and a 5-year plan for seeking funding for these needs; 3) a data-informed presentation on field stations in U.S. national parks with university partnerships at the Organization of Biological Field Stations meeting; and 4) a peer-reviewed manuscript submitted for publication."

A survey of, and visits to other FSMLs that face similar challenges as the DSC will be used to refine the current DSC Strategic Plan.  This Plan will guide development of an Operations Plan for improving infrastructure and logistical support of research at the DSC.  The final step will be to educate arid-land scientists about opportunities provided by the DSC, especially those of a cross-disciplinary nature, with an emphasis on recruiting use by faculty and students of minority-serving institutions.  These plans and a written summary of best-practices for increasing research and training at FSMLs operated by primarily-undergraduate institutions, as well as data associated with this program, will be made available through the DSC website (http://nsm.fullerton.edu/dsc/)."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The goal of this project is to understand the role of group size in the evolution of self-organization in ant colonies. Across social insects, larger colony sizes are associated with greater organizational complexity, but we still don't know how enlarging group size causes this pattern. Colony organization may result from natural selection to reduce potential gridlock of large groups, targeting individual behaviors or the shape of the colony's nest, both of which may govern interactions. Alternatively, complex organization may instead be a beneficial by-product of increasing group size. The fellow will test these hypotheses by comparing species of ants with different colony sizes. The findings from this research will help elucidate the evolutionary forces structuring groups more generally, from cell aggregations to animal societies. The fellow plans to broaden participation of under-represented groups by partnering with teachers at her former schools to create classroom workshops in which students collect data for this project, thereby creating opportunities for underrepresented K-12 students to participate directly in research, and will extend the same outreach opportunities to other minority-serving LA public schools partnered with UCLA's MESA School Program. <br/><br/>The project has three, interrelated objectives that examine how colony organization has evolved in response to increasing group size. First, the fellow will distinguish whether increasing colony size leads to costly versus beneficial changes by enlarging the groups of small-colony ant species (Temnothorax) and comparing them to naturally large colony species of equivalent size (Tapinoma, Linepithema). Second, the fellow will determine the contribution of nest architecture in structuring colony organization by housing colonies in subdivided or single-chambered nests. To facilitate comparison between distantly related ant species in the above objectives, the fellow will generate standardized metrics of (1) colony organization from social networks of nutrient flow and (2) colony functionality by assessing how well foragers respond to the nutritional needs of the entire colony. The fellow will learn to fluorescently label these nutrients and track them within the colony using computer vision. Third, the fellow will investigate which aspects of nest architecture have been adapted for large colony size. The fellow will lead k-12 students in to complete this final objective by allowing classroom ant colonies of various sizes to excavate nests in observable structures. The fellow will use the classroom ant colonies to facilitate educational workshops that will be targeted to help satisfy national teaching standards in STEM fields (NGSS) at the appropriate grade level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major goal is to update the framework of NEON's CI and put in place an architecture that is evolvable. Plans are to engage Battelle and the expertise it brings to the project in the evaluation of the CI requirements of the project. Participants in the workshop will engage in open discussion of issues and opportunities, identify constructive approaches towards enhancing NEON's CI, and provide suggestions about how to best maintain a CI framework that can be optimized to meet the community's needs over the life of the project.

Escherichia coli is an important model organism and is arguably the most completely understood cellular organism from a genetics and biochemistry standpoint. This high degree of understanding has made E. coli not just an important subject of research, but also the laboratory workhorse for studying a broad variety of organisms as well as an invaluable tool for biotechnology. The mission of the CGSC is to act as a central repository for genetically modified strains of E. coli created by the research community, so that they may be readily available to other researchers and educators. To that end, the CGSC maintains a collection of about 28,000 cultures of genetically defined derivatives of E. coli K-12. There are over 8,000 different mutations represented in this strain collection with verified mutations in over 90% of the 4,111 identified genes in the sequenced E. coli K-12 genome. These cultures are distributed to researchers and educators throughout the US and in over 65 countries worldwide. In addition to the distribution of cultures, the CGSC is also an information resource, and provides information about strains, mutations, genes, gene products and genetic maps, in a fully searchable database on the web. Importantly CGSC also acts as a source of expert information and advice for those researchers who have questions about using the E. coli strains in the collection. <br/><br/>The CGSC will continue to maintain and expand its publicly available database on strain genotypes, phenotypes, histories and pedigrees, which is unique to the Stock Center. The information systems will be enhanced to increase compatibility with other E. coli web resources, including the EcoliWiki project, EcoGene and EcoCyc. The CGSC is collaborating with other US culture collections and the World Data Centre for Microorganisms (WDCM) so that the collection can be indexed by global strain databases and to create a national microbial strain database. Over the period of this award, capabilities for our new strain construction services will be expanded for those users who require a genetically modified strain, but lack the capability of constructing it themselves, particularly to those outside of the traditional bacterial genetics community. This is a service unique to the CGSC and has shown great growth potential.  Access to the strain collection database, including genotypes, gene function and map location, as well as an extensive bibliography are available online (cgsc.biology.yale.edu).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to engage in research and training that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Chris A. Hamilton is ""Broadening Participation of Native Americans into Collections-Based Research: Testing Hypotheses on the Hawkmoth-Bat Evolutionary Arms Race."" The host institution for this fellowship is The University of Florida and The Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Akito Kawahara and Dr. Charles Cobb.  <br/><br/>The Fellow's research focuses on the evolution of morphological diversity in hawkmoths, a species-rich group of insects. This research enhances our understanding of how evolutionary pattern and process produced Earth's diversity, a key question in biology. Hawkmoths are large, charismatic moths that are strong, fast fliers, with a diverse array of forewing shape variation and body size, yet few studies have investigated the drivers of this spectacular morphological diversity. Between 50-60 million years ago, major evolutionary lineages of echolocating bats emerged, along with a large radiations of the Macroheterocera, a group of moth species that includes the hawkmoths. The Fellow is testing the intriguing but unexplored hypothesis that differences in hawkmoth wing shape and body size are associated with the diversity of their primary nocturnal predators - bats. This idea challenges the conventional hypothesis that moth diversification was driven by plant evolution (because plants are their food source). Across the approximately 1,500 species of hawkmoths, anti-bat traits can be found which include ears keen to a bat's ultrasonic echolocation and ultrasound-producing organs that ""jam"" bat biosonar. The fast flight of hawkmoths, also thought to be an anti-bat trait, likely provides the ability to escape predators and cover large distances as adult hawkmoths seek out food for themselves or host plants for their larvae. These extended periods of flight would render hawkmoths vulnerable to predation by bats, putatively providing a strong selective force that led to evasive anti-bat traits, diverse body sizes, and wing shapes able to support acrobatic evasive flight; however, no one has tested this hypothesis in a phylogenetic context.<br/><br/>The proposed project promotes the participation of Native American students in biology by using exciting research questions and an interactive learning approach to characterize hawkmoth wing shape, investigate the historical evolutionary sequence of anti-bat traits, and test for correlations between these traits and extant diversity. The Fellow is engaging middle and high school students from The Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, by utilizing museum collections at the FLMNH to answer fundamental hypotheses regarding patterns of diversity - effectively linking two of NSF's missions: increasing minority participation and increasing the utility of biological collections. This collaborative research introduces the students to the usefulness of natural history collections (students gather morphometric data on hawkmoth wing shape and body size), demonstrates how researchers can use these resources to answer fundamental biological questions, and sparks students? interest in evolution. In addition, Chickasaw Nation students are being exposed to their own cultural history during summer trips to the FLMNH; during this time they work in the collections, assist in DNA extraction and preparation for sequencing of hawkmoth species, and importantly, discover the history of their Chickasaw ancestors through interactions with archeological artifacts."

The fellow, Noor White, is conducting  research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Anand Swaroop (National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health) and Belinda Chang (University of Toronto).  Looking at the ways in which animals have adapted to novel or changing environments is key to understanding the world around us. This research investigates a particularly striking transition that some birds have undertaken the shift from a day-living (or diurnal) to a night-living (or nocturnal) environment. Being relatively rare in number, nocturnal birds have an advantage over diurnal birds in that there is less competition for food and fewer predators present at night than during the day. That advantage comes with challenges, however, and in particular the challenge of how to see in low-light environments. By asking what changes are present in the genes and proteins necessary for vision between diurnal and nocturnal birds, this project will uncover how birds have developed night vision, and adapted to a new environment. The genes and proteins involved in vision are conserved across vertebrates, and therefore the results of this project will be relevant to other animal groups, including humans. The data uncovered here will help society understand how vision works, and will be applicable and relevant to research on human vision and visual diseases, such as colorblindness.<br/><br/>This research will generate genomic and protein (through retinal transcriptome sequencing) sequences of visual genes from both nocturnal and diurnal birds with all lineages of nocturnal birds represented. The functional significance of molecular adaptations will be identified by expression of opsin proteins and direct measurement of their spectral sensitivity. The fellow hypothesizes that the transitions to nocturnality across the avian tree of life were independent, and thus novel mechanisms of adaptation will be found coincident with each major transition. This project relies on collections housed at major museums across the country, taking advantage of the work of previous scientists to carefully collect and curate birds from around the world. The fellow has a long history of public outreach and is committed to sharing her work with the public at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC.  Results from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings."

Biological research collections allow scientists to understand both how changes in the landscape affect species and to forecast how future changes to the landscape could affect those species. As indicators of environmental health, specimens preserved in biological research collections provide human society with a vital tool that can be applied to a diversity of issues related to human health, including studies of infectious diseases or the affect that disasters had on the environment. For example, without biological research collections, tracking the entire arc of an emerging infectious zoonotic disease (one caused by the transfer of an infectious agent from animals to humans) would be challenging if there were no animal specimens to determine the wild species that served as a reservoir for the infectious agent. Along the Gulf Coast of the United States, determining the biological effect of large oil spills on the deep-water and coastal environments would be challenging without good documentation of when and where species occurred before spills. Biological research collections are available to fill these needs through careful preservation of specimens that document when and where a species occurred. This grant supports the Collection of Genetic Resources at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, one of the oldest and largest collections of frozen tissues (e.g. heart, liver, muscle tissues) and tissue extracts (e.g. DNA) of wild vertebrates. Since its inception in 1979, the Collection has been acknowledged in more than 1500 publications and theses. The grant will allow the Collection to continue supplying the research community with the highest quality genetic materials.<br/><br/>The Collection of Genetic Resources at the LSU Museum of Natural Science houses genetic material from more than 140,000 individual wild animals representing over 8,000 species, with a rate of growth of ca. 10,000-15,000 samples per year from ca. 4,200 individuals. This collection is used by scientists working in a diversity of fields, and provides, on average, 2000 tissue subsamples to researchers around the globe each year. The Collection supplies genetic materials to the international community for research in genomics, molecular evolution, population genetics, ecology, wildlife management, forensics, epidemiology, environmental toxicology, and other areas.  Whenever possible, tissues in the Collection are flash frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen to ensure the preservation of fragile biomaterials, such as RNA and proteins, required by the dramatically expanding field of genomics. Optimally, those flash frozen tissues are transferred at LSU to liquid nitrogen vapor freezers (-196 degrees C) for long-term archiving. However, the Museum's six liquid nitrogen freezers are now full. This award provides funds to purchase two additional liquid nitrogen vapor freezers for the bird and mammal specimens, and a safer, more efficient liquid nitrogen delivery system and to provide support for a graduate assistant to transfer specimens from ultracold to the new liquid nitrogen freezers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finally, the instrument will be widely utilized in high school summer outreach programs to further educate and excite young minds.  <br/><br/>Due to the different disciplines involved, there will be a wide variety of projects supported by this award.  An environmental engineering project focuses on determining better ways to alleviate abandoned mine drainage, a common pollutant in Pennsylvania?s watersheds.  Two ecology-based projects, one seeking to create a better understanding of how diatoms are classified while the other will concentrate on understanding which proteins may be responsible for enhanced survival of dragonflies in cold temperatures. An animal development project will look at several genes to determine if they play a role in insect eye size.  Three projects that will use mouse models or cell cultures have applications towards human injury and diseases.  For example, a study applying stress to mice will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning susceptibility and resilience to chronic stress. A project exploring the signaling pathway of deer velvet antler extract, a substance commonly used by injured athletes, may lead to wider applications of the extract to treat injuries and organ regeneration.  A study highlighting the transcription complex of mitochondrial genes will provide insight into how mitochondria initiate gene expression.

The project is open to current faculty and postdoctoral fellows and is coordinated through several life sciences professional societies and faculty at a range of educational institutions. Network coordinators will recruit participants and provide venues for sharing of their achievements in enhanced active learning. Special efforts will be made to include instructors at minority-serving institutions and community colleges, where many under-served students begin their college careers. The outcome will be an expanding national network of undergraduate instructors who practice effective active learning methods, thus enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education. <br/><br/>Short-term exposure to principles of active learning is often not sufficient to promote significant change in teaching practices from lecture-dominated to a more effective learning format. The goal of the PALM Network is to provide long-term, hands-on mentoring experiences that will allow PALM Fellows to experience the scope of pedagogical and cultural changes needed to achieve effective change, and thus lead to change that will positively influence the teaching culture at each PALM Fellow's institution. PALM brings together stakeholders to support teaching mentorships to promote sustained biology education reform at diverse institutions. PALM will allow faculty and postdoctoral fellows to gain hands-on experience and at least one semester of mentorship in bringing evidence-based, effective active learning strategies into their classrooms. PALM Fellows will pair with mentors who have reformed their teaching, visit their mentors to observe and participate in redesigned classes, develop an active learning module for one of their classes with guidance from their mentors, demonstrate how they have adjusted their practice to use active learning, and disseminate their work at their home institutions and at professional society meetings and in the peer-reviewed science education literature. Evaluation of the program will involve analysis of PALM Fellows' teaching practices before and after mentorship and annual follow-up surveys for 3-5 years afterwards to determine long-range impact. A Steering Committee consisting of educational representatives from seven life sciences professional societies and faculty from a variety of institutional types will oversee the program, screen applicants for mentorships, provide mentor orientation and regular follow-up, and coordinate information sharing meetings of Fellows and mentors each year. By capitalizing on Steering Committee links to minority- and tribal-serving institutions, societies of underrepresented scientists, and community colleges, which educate over half the minority students in the U.S., PALM will bring Vision and Change reforms to faculty and undergraduate students who have not factored prominently into past pedagogical reform plans.  <br/> <br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

Just as smartphones and social media have transformed the way people interact and acquire their news, breakthroughs in image processing, GPS satellite and wireless animal trackers as well as DNA and stable isotope analytical tools are emboldening scientist to solve old ecological and environmental problems in new ways and to design new studies that ask and answer questions that were inconceivable only a few years ago.  At the 22,000 ha Mpala Research Center in central Kenya, US scientists from over a dozen US universities and Institutes supported by 14 NSF and NIH grants, resulting in 197 publications in the last 5 years, study the ecology of a 20,000 Km2 semi-arid ecosystem that sustains the second most diverse array of wildlife in Kenya as well as supporting livelihoods of commercial ranchers, pastoral herders and farmers who share the landscape with this wildlife.   It is a model system that supports large scale experiments that are difficult to do within the continental US.  Moreover, the Mpala, Research Center, especially with the new modern lab envisioned, continues to serve as an educational laboratory that teaches US undergraduate and graduate students of all ethnicities and walks of life how do real, important, relevant and transformative science. In addition, their interactions with students, faculty and PIs from Kenya and around the world provide a diversity of perspectives that will make them broader scientists able to work within different cultures.  In this way, Mpala is training the next generation of environmental leaders, some of whom will practice science, but others of whom will shape science policy. <br/><br/>At Mpala, research generally focuses on the biogeochemistry as well as the population, community and behavioral dynamics of the animals and plants inhabiting the ecosystem.   But as strong as the research has been to date, advances in DNA and genetical analytical techniques will transform science, allowing more in depth looks at the diets, the competitive and mutualistic relationships of animal species comprising food webs as well as the population genetics of species spread across expansive spatial and temporal scales.  Similar advances in stable isotope analytical tools will enable novel and more detailed investigations into the functioning of the ecosystem, closer examination of water use by plants that drive and limit photosynthesis as well as those of animals that shape their movements, habitat uses and overall decision-making, and the paleoecology of many extinct species, including our human ancestors.   These new tools will also provide important insights underlying interactions among wildlife and people, thus helping reduce conflict that accompanies human population growth and expansion.  In order to carry out this research, the new analytical tools must be purchased and a new 'clean' building that isolates the equipment form the harsh, dusty and hot tropical climatic elements of central Kenya must be constructed.  This new facility will propel the NSF and NIH supported scientists and their students to uncover new rules shaping environmental patterns and processes that were impossible to study before the emergence of these new technological advances.  What is learned in Kenya where biodiversity is high and the land is shared between people and wildlife easily applies to similar ecosystems, species and problems found in the western and southwestern states in the US.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first project, a Cellular Machine Shop/Core, will create an inventory of high throughput and modular tools for cell engineering that will enable the ""build"" step of the engineering ""design, build, test"" cycle. A set of core resources and instruments for the Center community will be assembled, including high throughput and quantitative imaging systems, gene synthesis, and next generation sequencing. These will be used to assemble modules for cellular engineering in other Center projects.  The second project, Computer Aided Design, will generate tools to implement a computational ""design"" platform for engineering cells with predictable and desired internal structure, as well as to design multi-cellular structures. The third project will create the molecular tools necessary to program multiple specialized cell types or organisms into multicellular structures capable of executing complex functions. The fourth project ""Living Bioreactor"" will specify the organization of intracellular and multi-cellular structures to implement new approaches to metabolic engineering by tuning organelle size to improve yield, and by creating multi-layered self-assembling/self-healing multi-kingdom cell aggregates capable of withstanding harsh conditions, resisting contamination, and facilitating harvesting of the desired products. The fifth project ""Cell State Inference Engine"" will create a software platform for converting images of cells into estimates of cell environment and signaling state, permitting e.g. the use of cells as living sensors of environmental conditions for real-world applications, and also providing a framework for predicting how cells transition between phenotypic states, one of the great challenges in cell biology"

This instrumentation will expand the scope of research in multiple departments at JMU and in neighboring institutions by enabling faculty and students to study the dynamics of molecules, cells, and tissues. JMU and most of its neighboring colleges are primarily undergraduate institutions and are committed to engaging students in learning through faculty-mentored research. Indeed, students are responsible for over 95% of the total research use of our core microscopy facility. The new microscope system will provide these students with exposure to live imaging and multi-fluorescence technologies unavailable elsewhere in our region, and will expand the facility's ability to increase research opportunities for undergraduates. This instrumentation will also enhance formal upper-division courses such as Human Histology and Environmental Microbiology by providing students with practical training in light microscopy techniques. Moreover, in an effort to expand our impact on undergraduate research training, we will work with Bridgewater College's Biology Department (a neighboring, small liberal arts college) to provide access for their upper-division courses. Finally, this microscope system will support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education in the northern Shenandoah Valley region by enhancing the JMU Biology Department's local elementary school outreach program. This program provides K-5 classes with the kinds of science enrichment experiences known to pique early interest in science (but often only accessible to select populations) to all students regardless of academic readiness, language and cultural barriers, and socioeconomic status. This state-of-the-art instrument will be integrated into 5th grade learning modules focusing on the components and dynamic nature of cells.<br/><br/>The new fluorescence microscope system will open new investigative avenues for researchers at JMU and in the region by enabling the study of dynamic processes at multiple levels of biological organization-from molecular assemblies to entire organisms-and by accommodating multi-fluorescent-label imaging with a broader diversity of fluorescent probes. It will advance the research and training programs of at least 16 faculty members from three institutions and multiple STEM fields including biology, kinesiology, regenerative medicine, mathematics, engineering and science education. Projects that will be substantially impacted include: cornea tissue wound healing and regeneration; using molecular and mathematical tools to investigate cell- and organism-level responses to protein mis-folding (a component of many neurodegenerative diseases) in nematodes; genome reorganization during crustacean development; the relationship between stress and feeding behavior in mammals; and the role of endocrine signaling in the control of sexual signal production in snakes.

RMBL's ability to support year-round research will be transformed by building the laboratory's first fully four season housing dedicated to scientists and students.  A changing climate, combined with rapid technological advancements, including in genomics, the microbiome, and sensing, has significantly increased demand for RMBL facilities outside summer.  RMBL is intensively used; more than 175 scientists from 76 institutions have had research projects at the laboratory during the last 6 years.  Year-round housing will allow scientists to track important biological activity that now happens outside summer, as well as applying the full range of genomic, microbiome, and sensing tools available to understanding and predicting biological systems.  The new cabin will also create unique opportunities for winter programming.  RMBL works with the Crested Butte Adaptive Sports Center, whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities through exceptional outdoor adventure activities, to provide unique opportunities to individuals with disabilities.  Additionally, RMBL works with a local school to provide K-12 science education in the backcountry.  Finally, this project will relieve housing pressure in the summer, which will support our undergraduate research program, as well as the scientists' research programs.  <br/><br/><br/>This grant would fund the first fully four season housing dedicated to scientists year-round. Construction of this cabin would reflect the need of the nation's scientific infrastructure to adapt to a changing climate.  Over the last 35 years mean temperature has increased approximately 0.73° C and snow melt date has advanced approximately 11 days.  This has translated into biological activity over longer parts of the year.   Marmots are emerging almost 40 days earlier than they were in the 1970's, first flowering has advanced 11 days over the last 35 years while last flowering is happening 5 days later over the same time period.  Changes in science are also driving increased demand for RMBL outside summer.  Field scientists have access to a rapidly expanding range of techniques and tools, many of which are best utilized outside summer.  We now have fall and spring visitation associated with maintaining sensors, conducting experiments involving the microbiome, and applying genomic techniques.  RMBL's scientific community, and our governing Board, have identified adding year-round housing as a top priority.  Despite growing demand, RMBL currently has no four-season living facilities that provide all basic amenities to scientists.  Construction of the cabin will transform RMBL's ability to support science outside summer, leverage a large existing investment in science by increasing access to research equipment, and enhance RMBL's sustainability by allowing it to generate revenue outside summer.  Numerous federally funded research groups would be supported by this project covering questions on plant population genomics, fungal-plant associations, and biogeochemistry. These teams have struggled to maintain productivity outside summer because of housing.  This project would also support a unique collection of long-term research and the insights they offer into a changing world.  RMBL hosts 17 long-term research programs, several extending 50+ years, which RMBL supports.  Year-round housing will allow scientists to take full advantage of this wealth of knowledge, tracking important biological activity that now happens outside summer, as well as applying the full range of genomic, microbiome, and sensing tools available to understanding and predicting biological systems.

The proposed facility, which we call the ""FLBS SensorSpace"", will advance a variety of cutting-edge research areas, such as: novel networked sensors for high-resolution physiochemical monitoring; eDNA detection with automated in situ genomic analyzers; stream turbulence and bedload monitoring with acoustic profilers; single-cell genomics with microfluidic devices; high resolution ground-truthing of passive optical sensors; and in situ stream metabolism assessment from continuous physical-chemical profiling, to name a few.  Four core technology zones will define the proposed FLBS SensorSpace: Manufacturing, Optics, Microfluidics, and Embedded Systems. In addition to these four core capacities, the facility will include a meeting space where researchers can work/teach/collaborate in a flexible manner, a computer terminal bench, a teaching/reading area, and a technology showcase display. This facility will advance ongoing and anticipated research at FLBS and help make the station a regional magnet for scientists and students interested in developing and field-testing customized sensor systems suited to their needs, ranging from the most basic to the most advanced capabilities currently available.  The SensorSpace will also advance education, public appreciation of science, and commercial applications.  This will occur via integration of the SensorSpace into the curricula of our summer course offerings and development of a new course, ""Environmental Sensor Design and Production""; via collaboration with Salish Kootenai College; via programs for high school students; via efforts to establish a freestanding Citizen Science program at FLBS; and via use of the SensorSpace to attract environmental scientists, students, entrepreneurs, and businesses interested in developing sensors and other instrumentation as part of their research and development portfolio, leading to economic benefits and intellectual property."

MacIsaac Facility for Aquatic Cytometry (FAC) and acquire a multi-user, shore and seagoing flow cytometric analyzer and imaging cytometer to support, research, training and education in the field of aquatic microbiology.  The FAC at Bigelow Laboratory has been a multi-user research facility for over 30 years to advance the study of aquatic microbes and algae in marine and freshwater ecosystems.  The primary structure of aquatic ecosystems is microscopic.  Many new types and function of aquatic microorganisms have been discovered using flow cytometry (measurement of cells suspended in fluid flow).  The majority of these microbes remain uncultivable and are therefore largely unknown.  The FAC facilitates aquatic microbiology research to a broad research community allowing for this vast, untapped reservoir of biodiversity in these environments to be identified. It also provides training and education on both flow cytometry and aquatic microbiology to a broad range of students, including, undergraduates, graduate students and research scientists.  The modernization of the FAC will support a variety of aquatic research (freshwater and marine) as well as the development of new aquatic flow cytometric applications.  The instrumentation will be a part of the FAC, a multi-user center for training and applications of advance cytometric technology for the study of aquatic microbes.<br/><br/>The current instrumentation at the FAC is well used and outdated.  Advances in optical technology (fiber optics, imaging, and fluorochrome detection) allow for flow cytometric instrumentation that contains solid-state lasers and are available in numerous wavelengths spanning the UV and visible light spectrum, some of which are better suited for aquatic biological applications.  The new instruments acquired by this project will facilitate the ongoing primary research at Bigelow Laboratory and within the broader aquatic science community, develop new approaches and applications using both flow and imaging capabilities, and educate students and scientists in flow cytometric methods and applications.  The new flow cytometric cell analyzer has a number of features that will enhance research capabilities, a 3-laser system for multiple wavelength excitation with up to 17 detectors for scatter and fluorescence particle detection, the ability to do volumetric counting, and includes a universal sample loader in order to rapidly process samples.

A confocal microscope is an essential tool for studying cell and gene function in animals, plants, and microorganisms, as well as in material sciences. The confocal microscope also improves the quality and expands the scope of the research, training and educational activities in many scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and engineering. The new confocal microscope will be housed in the Lamar Bruni Vergara Science Center within the Department of Biology and Chemistry and the School of Engineering in the College of Arts and Sciences of TAMIU. The confocal microscope serves as the core and multi-user microscope for all departments at TAMIU as well as surrounding Laredo communities, including the Laredo Community College (LCC). Investigators that use the microscope will train undergraduate and graduate students to utilize this imaging technique in coursework as well as research environments. On a broader level, the microscope support several programs that train college students from underrepresented groups pursuing college degrees. These programs include; 1) the university's continued growth as a research-oriented institution, 2) the range of available cutting-edge methodologies that would improve scientific results and competitiveness for federal research funding, 3) the development of hands-on research experiences for students, and 4) TAMIU's visibility in the community, as a leading academic institution of the Rio Grande Valley. These needs are fundamental for student and faculty recruitment and retention, professional growth, and the development of technologically oriented graduates to foster the socio-economic development in South Texas. This equipment will significantly enhance research productivity and educational opportunities at TAMIU. It will also strengthen ongoing services to communities and collaborations in the region. Thus, the new confocal microscope will become an essential tool for current and future scientists as well as engineers in all of Laredo communities.<br/><br/>The new instrumentation primarily serves users from the Department of Biology and Chemistry and the School of Engineering at TAMIU for individual research, research training programs, and teaching. The four major research projects that use the confocal microscope are multidisciplinary including investigation of the roles of microtubules in Drosophila eye development; study of host-pathogen interactions in Mycoplasma pneumoniae pathogenesis and their potential for drug discovery; determination of the role of a novel gene cia7 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; and non-destructive confocal imaging for surface analysis of materials. Research projects benefit from increased resolution, enhanced scanning speeds and the ability to conduct live cell-imaging experiments. The new confocal microscope meets both the current and future needs for research and education across multiple disciplines at TAMIU and Laredo communities."

Algorithms have long been the language of computing, and all biological systems must compute (i.e., process information) to survive. Thus, the study of ""algorithms in nature"" can represent a new field of interdisciplinary research between computer science and biology. More specifically, this project seeks to uncover fundamental network design strategies and optimization principles shared by branching structures in nature, including plant shoot (above-ground) and root (below-ground) architectures, as well as neural branching arbors in the brain. Understanding the basic patterns that evolution has used to design these systems has bi-directional benefits; it can lead to improved understanding of how these natural networks process information and function in both health and disease, and it can lead to new computational strategies for building better engineered networks. Educationally, making the study of algorithms a requirement in life science curricula can help educate the next-generation of interdisciplinary scientists.<br/>    <br/> This project has three Aims. The first Aim is to discover principles governing how plant architectures grow and adapt to changing environments. This Aim will: (1) study how different network optimization trade-offs sculpt the shape of plant shoot architectures using the theory of Pareto optimality, and how different trade-off objectives are prioritized depending on the environment and species; (2) determine the molecular mechanisms (genes) that drive prioritizations; and (3) determine what search algorithms are used by plant shoots to find resources and to strategize growth. These questions will be studied using 3D laser scanning of crop species (tomato, tobacco, sorghum, corn, rice) grown across multiple conditions and time-points, and of model species with different genetic backgrounds. Overall, this Aim will link network design principles commonly studied in computer science with those driving network formation and adaptation in plants, and may help design and evaluate breeding strategies to enhance crop yield. The second Aim is to develop models of network warfare to study plant-plant competition. This Aim will: (1) create ""gladiator-style"" arenas to study how two plants battle for limited light; (2) develop game theory methods to assess whether dominant or stable strategies emerge; and (3) quantify how competition strategies differ based on the species of the two plants and their growth environment. This Aim will lead to predictive models of plant social interactions that can inform the design of polyculture farming spaces based on which plants ""get along"" the best. The third Aim is to test the generality of these principles to other biological and engineered branching structures. This Aim will test if the branching properties learned from plant shoot architectures also dictate the structure of plant root architectures below ground and neural (axonal and dendritic) architectures in the brain. For example, are root architectures also Pareto optimal? What search algorithms do they use to find nutrients? How does competition affect these strategies? This will also lead to the first quantitative comparison of branching structures across two kingdoms of life, from plants to neurons. Finally, this Aim will also study human-engineered networks that also must adapt their structure to resource availability and demand in dynamic environments. Insights from biology could reveal new strategies for optimal reconstruction of damaged infrastructure after war or natural disasters, or extension of existing infrastructure into developing areas.<br/>    <br/> URL: http://www.snl.salk.edu/~navlakha/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This development will provide biologists with new imaging capabilities, similar to advantages adaptive optics provided to astronomers, enabling them to obtain the highestresolution deep-tissue images in neurobiology to study brain development and synapse plasticity in the nervous system, in cell biology to study cell cycle events, and in developmental biology to study stem cells, chromatin remodeling and the cytoskeleton. The research activities in this project include opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to participate in a multidisciplinary research team consisting of optical physicists, electrical engineers, and biologists, contributing to their training as the next generation of instrumentalists and advanced users. The research activities and instrumentation will be integrated into teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels through hands-on projects in engineering and science courses at UCSC, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), and through an NSF sponsored outreach program, the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science(COSMOS), a summer residential program for high school scholars with demonstrated interest and achievement in math and science. They will also work in a partnership with all ten UC campuses and three affiliated national labs (LANL, LBNL, and LLNL) and industry to broadly disseminate the technology to the biological research community. Such improvements will benefit society by greatly advancing our fundamental understanding of life processes at the cellular and sub-cellular levels.<br/><br/>The proposed activity more than doubles the depth (>1,500nm) of diffraction limited imaging (738 nm) into dynamic live tissue (AO frame rate >1 Hz) where many fundamental cellular processes occur, such as neuron growth, organization and synapse formation. For example, by increasing the imaging depth from 500 um to 1,000 um, they can reach the deeper cortical layers to see if synaptic reorganization during development and under pathological conditions follows similar rules as in the superficial cortical layers, were synapses are constantly remodeling in living animals. By increasing the imaging depth beyond 1,000 um they can reach the Hippocampus, the site for learning and memory. This will allow studies of how synapses reorganize during learning and how they encode for long-lasting memory."

Citizens, with and without higher educational backgrounds, are increasingly required to make impactful choices based on their understanding of biology. multimedia learning resources (illustrations, animations, interactive media) play an essential role in biology education and are a common feature not only in today's undergraduate science classrooms, but also in various informal learning settings (online/print news media and science museums for example). Instructors rely upon these visual learning resources for teaching and students seek them out in support of their studies. Despite the popularity of these resources, little is known about their efficacy in supporting learning in undergraduate biology. Indeed, the scientific accuracy, clarity, and quality of these resources can be highly variable. <br/><br/>A primary goal of the VISABLI network is to address an acknowledged gap between the communities responsible for the design and evaluation of scientific visualizations and the teachers who use these materials in the classroom. We seek to connect these distinct disciplines into a network fostering the co-creation of new knowledge and sparking innovative research; these three largely independent communities share a common goal of improving the design efficacy of instructional visualizations. The network activities will focus on an in-depth needs assessment, followed by meetings bringing together members of these three communities to identify and develop shared resources, and will conclude with a VISABLI website to disseminate them. We will work with the biology scientific societies to organize a series of workshops during which activities like collaborative storyboarding will give instructors a better sense of the visualization process and an appreciation for the difficult intersection of visualization design and pedagogy. These activities will also help to identify areas of instruction that are not well served with existing curricula.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Northwestern University will help develop higher eigenmode ""Ultrasound Bioprobe"" for sub-cellular biological imaging. The objective of this project is to develop Ultrasound Bioprobe with higher order harmonics capabilities to detect and track subcellular defects at nanoscale resolution under physiological conditions. Anticipated applications will investigate the dynamics of endothelial cells under cellular transfection to develop potential therapeutics for acute lung injuries in the early stage. It will further be extended to study the progression of tumorous cells at onset of their development. In Ultrasound Bioprobe, the cantilever monitors the perturbation to the surface acoustic waves, especially their phase, which carry information about embedded or buried sub-structures reflected in the scattering of specimen acoustic waves due to the difference in their respective viscoelastic properties. Variations in the amplitude and phase of the bulk wave due to the presence of the sub-surface nanostructures/defects as well as the variations in near surface affect the amplitude and the phase of the difference frequency signal (beats) which is detected by cantilever. These variations are used to create spatial mappings generated by subsurface and near-surface features/defects. To realize these efforts requires a way to combine scanning probe microscopy hardware,functional electronics and its integration into an FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) for simultaneous generation and detection of multiple harmonics in scan using labVIEW codes. By leveraging the nanoscale resolution of scanning probe microscope and use of higher order harmonics, this innovative approach may provide a new way to perform sub-cellular biological imaging of living cells in close to real-time, uninhibited by traditionally cited challenges in electron microscopy methods that require chemically fixing of the cells or cryo preservation and conventional confocal/fluorescent microscopies that require fluorescent tags to image and have micro scale resolutionThe ability of the Ultrasound Bioprobe to detect features at nanometer scale has important implications to study the nanomechanics of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells which are transfected with plasmid. It will help understand how to regulate endothelial cell structural arrangements that result in the barrier function properties of the pulmonary vasculature and to assist therapeutics targets. <br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the project promises to open new vistas in high resolution non-destructive and non-invasive imaging of biological and soft structures under physiologically viable conditions. The ultrasound bioprobe will be positioned to provide abroad user base with exposure to the developed technology. Once developed, the technology will be accessible to other institutions, broadening their user base to include life sciences. In undergraduate course material, the PI?s will use examples from this research project to highlight how integration of engineering and physical principles is incorporated into real biological research. The PI?s will promote the active participation of women and other minorities in science and participation in classroom visits to elementary schools through the Science Chicago program in Midwest and Chicago public institutions for broader audience. The education plan focuses on development of a teaching module in sub-cellular imaging which includes hand-on-laboratory demo and classroom tutorials.  The educational objectives will be achieved by (a) providing hand-on, team experience to promote active and collaborative learning; (b) exposing promising students at the undergraduate level to research opportunities in emerging field of sub-cellular biological imaging, and (c) to recruit and retain traditionally under-represented students though MIN (Minority Internships in Nanotechnology) programs which provide opportunities for undergraduates to participate in hands-on research in the area of nanotechnology.<br/><br/>Thsi award is co-funded by CBET/Biophotonics Program, and Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR)."

The pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has decimated numerous populations of amphibians. Several bacteria living on the skin of amphibians produce anti-fungal chemicals that repress the growth of Bd. These bacteria can be used to treat/prevent infections by this pathogen, but it is unknown whether Bd can develop resistance to these bacteria over time. The fellow's research characterizes the skin microbiome of several amphibian species, to identify commonalities and differences in services provided by skin microbes. In addition, the fellow is evaluating whether repeated pressure from common anti-Bd bacteria induces evolutionary changes in Bd over generations.

The ByWater Biological Field Station lies in an eight-acre forest tract in the City of New Orleans, contiguous with a larger 5,000-acre bottomland hardwood forest on the city's southern margin. The site offers wide range of opportunities for experimental and applied research, education, public engagement and science communication, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The scientific importance of the site lies in its experimental value for the development and refining of urban ecosystem management techniques, and additionally in the site's proximity to and embeddedness in important regional deltaic processes and related policy development. Further, the ByWater Field Station is already utilized as an environmental education and arts integration facility for the region. Strategic planning will be undertaken to compliment these uses with a rigorous scientific program that aims to support partnerships with diverse stakeholders in the region. The ByWater Biological Field Station represents a key opportunity for scientific practice and community engagement in Louisiana and beyond. <br/><br/>This planning project for the ByWater Biological Field Station will produce a five-year strategic plan for a new peri-urban field station situated at the nexus of vulnerable ecosystems and communities. Research at the Station has the potential to significantly contribute to use-inspired urban, forest, coastal, and riverine science ongoing in the region and growing nationally. The human and biophysical factors shaping forest dynamics in and around the Station represent a locally important and globally relevant setting for scientific research and land management policy development.

The scope of disciplines required to understand brain structure and function - chemistry, molecular biology, structural biology, biophysics, electrical engineering, computational science, cognitive science and psychology - to say nothing of the fields of inquiry and exploration that are influenced by this understanding, such as religion, art, music, philosophy, sociology and literature, is far-reaching. The sheer scale of the cells contained in the human brain, in contemplating the vast number of neurons, some 80 billion, and the hundreds to thousands of connections that each neuron forms with other neurons, along with the additional 80 billion non-neuronal support cells, makes for a daunting parts list to catalog. And yet, beyond just a static picture of the arrangement of these various cells into ensembles and networks, the dynamic information flow between these cells, the electrical and chemical impulses that underpin the very essence of human existence - sensation, thought, emotion, cognition - represent not just an additional layer of complexity, but, at its core, a deep mystery to be unraveled and explored. To push back at this frontier requires new thoughts, new tools, new techniques, and new interpretations that will almost certainly come from teams of scientists working across disciplines to bring new approaches that are more than the sum of their parts. This project will develop and apply new methods for non-invasively measuring electrical signals underlying brain cell communication.<br/><br/>This award establishes a NeuroNex Innovation Project at the University of California, Berkeley, which will develop chemical-genetic methods to measure neuronal activity in a non-invasive, high-throughput, high-fidelity manner across multiple length scales, at high speed, and in multiple species with molecular precision.  The team will optically read-out neuronal activity by directly imaging changes in membrane voltage with bright, sensitive, chemically-synthesized voltage-sensitive fluorophores. The voltage-sensitive fluorophore make use of photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) as a voltage-sensing trigger to provide fast, sensitive, non-disruptive optical recordings in neurons. In this project, pairing of PeT-based voltage-sensitive dyes with genetic targeting methods to enable optical voltage sensing with sub-cellular and sub-millisecond resolution in intact animal brains will be conducted. This NeuroNex Innovation Award is part of the BRAIN Initiative and NSF's Understanding the Brain activities."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Caitlin Fong is ""Resistance and Resilience of Turf Communities to Pressed and Pulsed Subsidies?. The host institution for this fellowship is California State University Northridge (CSUN), and the sponsoring scientist is Robert Carpenter. <br/><br/>This research explores the consequences of resource subsidies for coral reefs. Resource subsidies, an addition of a resource to an ecosystem from outside its boundaries, have important influences on ecological systems, and mounting evidence suggests that human activities are increasingly influencing resource subsidies. Resources subsidies vary widely in magnitude, duration, and frequency; the pattern, or subsidy regime, can range from pulses (low frequency, high magnitude) to presses (high frequency, low magnitude). It has been proposed that increasing subsidies of nitrogen and sediment, in conjunction with reduced herbivory, cause shifts in coral reef communities from a dominance of corals to dominance by macroalgae. The Fellow is characterizing the nutrient and sediment subsidy regime of a fringing reef in French Polynesia, and quantifying the effects of the subsidies on benthic organisms. The Fellow is testing the hypothesis that nitrogen availability and sediment load are characterized by a pulse-press regime, are increased with rainfall events, and attenuate with distance from the source stream.  The Fellow is also using lab and field assays to test the hypothesis that algal species have individual responses to press versus pulse nutrient and sediment subsidies and different resistance to herbivores that can be characterized by trade-offs.  Finally, the Fellow is conducting a field experiment to test the hypothesis that the subsidy regimes of nitrogen and sediments interact with each other and with herbivory to drive shifts in benthic organisms. <br/><br/>CSUN is an official minority serving (MSI) and Hispanic serving (HSI) intuition, and 51% of the students are self-described minorities, which facilitates the Fellow?s efforts to broaden the participation of under-represented groups. She is collaborating with existing programs at CSUN aimed at broadening participation to channel students into her research program in biology and ocean science. Additionally, the Fellow is offering a workshop for graduates students entitled ?Develop Your Outreach? to develop research modules or teachable units aimed at exposing and involving underrepresented groups in science.  Finally, the Fellow is sharing her research through online platforms, including: 1) publishing research updates on her personal website, 2) publishing updates called ?A Day in the Life of a Marine Ecologist?, 3) creating videos of fieldwork to provide a virtual field experience to students, and 4) using Twitter and Instagram accounts to provide updates on research."

Webb Coastal Research Station, a newly-established biological field station operated by the University of North Florida (UNF) in Jacksonville, FL. The Webb Station is a 1,050-acre parcel of undeveloped salt marsh habitat located on the eastern side of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway between Jacksonville and St. Augustine, FL. As much of the world observed while watching cable news footage of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, Jacksonville, like many U.S. coastal cities, faces significant threats from coastal flooding due to the combined effects of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and other coastal stressors. The intended purpose of the Webb Center is to use this ""living laboratory"" as a location for testing new approaches for reducing coastal flooding and making shoreline communities more ""resilient"" to its effects. This will be accomplished by teaming UNF Coastal and Marine Biologists with Coastal Engineers from the University's Taylor Engineering Research Institute to establish a world-class research program in newly-growing field of Coastal Resilience. In addition to spearheading new efforts to reduce coastal flooding, the Webb Center will also be heavily involved in educating students at all grade levels and members of the general public about its risks which, based on an April 2017 report by the U.S. Geological Survey, are believed to threaten the survival of nearly a quarter of the world?s population.<br/><br/>The goal of this FSML planning grant is to support the development of a 5-year strategic plan for the research and educational use of the station. To accomplish the goal of this project, the University proposes to: conduct faculty site visits to 4 currently operating coastal research stations to identify potential desirable features for the Webb station and learn about ""best practices"" for the operation of a successful biological field station; host survey visits by 4 external scientists experienced in the management of biological field stations to obtain their expert assistance in identifying infrastructure needs and operational/management requirements, potential research and educational programs, and unique features of the Webb Station that could potentially set it apart from other coastal research stations; and establish an Advisory Board consisting of UNF faculty and administrators and representatives from other regional colleges and universities, local informal science education facilities, community groups, K-12 schools, city/state/federal policymakers, and other agencies involved in coastal research, engineering, and conservation to guide the development of a 5-year strategic plan, making use of information obtained from faculty site visits and visiting expert recommendations. Proposed activities for the Webb Station will advance understanding and discovery in the field of coastal biology and engineering while promoting the education and career development of future coastal science professionals and the development of a more Ocean-literate community.

Evidence is rapidly mounting indicating that these co-occurring periods of precipitation deficit and warm temperatures are likely to increase over the next century and pose a serious threat to biodiversity and the critical services these ecosystems provide society. While the impacts of a warmer and drier future on these and similar ecosystems are expected to be severe, some species and ecological communities may be more vulnerable to these changes than others.  Understanding the factors that drive differences in vulnerability is one of the preeminent scientific and societal challenges of our time as this knowledge is essential for prioritizing conservation efforts and for identifying practical adaptation strategies that can conserve or enhance critical services these ecosystems provide society under changing environmental conditions.  To address this need, this project develops linked infrastructure at the UC Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC) that will allow researchers to (1) measure how exposure to drought and elevated air temperatures varies over time and across the topographically complex landscapes and (2) experimentally apply different levels of drought and air temperature to key plant communities and species that are critical drivers of services these ecosystems provide society. The infrastructure developed here not only allows multiple lines of new research around drought and warming impacts to be pursued but does so while greatly reducing start-up costs for researchers, thus overcoming a major barrier to greater participation in climate change research by students and scientists from underrepresented institutions.  This project also adds key capacity to expand K-12 STEM education and science content training for educators to diverse and rural agricultural communities in northern California having markedly less access to STEM and science education training opportunities than most areas in the state.<br/><br/>While the need to deploy an integrated framework for assessing species vulnerability to climate change is widely acknowledged, globally we have minimal field infrastructure that allows us to simultaneously assess impacts due to climate change exposure and impacts due to climate change sensitivity. To address this need, this project establishes linked research infrastructure distributed across the University of California Sierra Foothill Research and Extension Center (SFREC, http://sfrec.ucanr.edu/) that supports continuous measurements on local exposure to climate change and experimental assessment of multiple factors that drive variation in species sensitivity to these changes.  Specifically, this research infrastructure includes (1) a distributed wireless network of meteorological and hydrological sensors to measure and model how regional climate exposure is modified by topographic complexity and (2) a distributed field system for experimental manipulations of precipitation and warming that will provide researchers extensive ability to develop mechanistic understanding of factors (e.g. ecophysiological traits, genetic diversity, plasticity) and interactions (competition, biological invasions, soil microbial community) that ultimately drive variation in species and population sensitivity to climate change.  The wireless mesh system will be constructed using commercially available wireless technology and environmental sensors. This system also will allow future researchers the ability to add project specific sensors. For experimental manipulations of field conditions, experimental warming will be achieved using large (7 x 7 m) passive warming structures designed to minimizes airflow disruption and provide sufficient space for multiple experiments to be run simultaneously in a cost-effective manner.  Precipitation manipulations will be achieved using a polycarbonate roof system coupled to an automated precipitation redistribution system that will allow researchers to increase or decrease precipitation inputs relative to ambient inputs on an hourly basis. This infrastructure extends our current global research capacity by providing researchers an experimental framework to establish mechanistic and causal linkages between regional climate change and local changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function. This research infrastructure also provides an unparalleled ability to test and model conservation benefits of various biodiversity management tools and strategies. Ultimately this infrastructure should support major positive steps for biodiversity conservation in these and similar Mediterranean systems across the globe."

Specific research projects will be developed under one of these themes and research groups consisting of faculty and students from more than one institution within the network will submit position papers to the FEWER RCN steering committee so that the initiation of projects may be scheduled during the term of the grant.  Faculty are expected to engage graduate students and undergraduates in this research using a variety of mechanisms, including institutional funding for undergraduates, REU funding that is available across the network, and other funding sources.  A few student internship awards will be available directly through the RCN. <br/> <br/>The FEWER RCN will enhance emerging areas in food, energy, water and ecosystem resources and facilitate new research collaborations between scientists within MIRC and between MIRC and the international partners.  From an academic development perspective, this project aims to increase the number of minority and minority-serving faculty engaged in international research. It will also address scientific problems of importance to stakeholders within the Mississippi River system and the Lower Mekong Basin.  This project is aligned with the goals of the U.S. Department of State's ""Lower Mekong Initiative"" and officials from governments within foreign partner countries as well as the U.S. State Department are aware of and will be informed on a periodic basis of results from this NSF-funded RCN effort. This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

This proposal aims to uncover the basic principles that direct how organisms tailor their physiological responses to environmental changes.  Understanding why certain responses occur requires a precise map showing which genes are regulated in a given response and how they are coordinated.  Using prior NSF ABI support, the Baliga Laboratory at the Institute for Systems Biology developed an approach to create precise maps of gene regulation for any microbial species. Using this approach, they mapped gene regulation in a set of important organisms including uranium-reducing Desulfovibrio vulgaris, lipid-accumulating Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, yeast, diatoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The next goal is to see how well the maps work as tools to predict the results when manipulating complex behaviors. Effective tools have wide-ranging implications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. Initially, new algorithms and software will be developed to further refine the gene regulation maps and identify factors affecting gene regulation during environmental changes. The focus will be understanding how organisms switch on or off specific behaviors in response to environmental cues. The work will be performed in two organisms - E. coli, a well-known, widely studied bacterium, and Halobacterium salinarum, an extremophile that thrives in high salt environments; it will be readily applicable to all sequenced microorganisms that are of significant industrial, agricultural, and medical importance. Part of the project is to develop and disseminate new high school curriculum to introduce the importance of computational modeling in solving real world problems such as food scarcity and climate change. Diverse populations of students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds, including those currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), will receive training and sustained support as they learn this interdisciplinary science. This curriculum and training is part of a program called Systems Education Experiences (SEE) that reaches thousands of students and teachers each month. SEE works toward cultivating systems thinkers who can tackle problems, contribute to a STEM-literate citizenry, and help build a more diverse population of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to develop a framework to elucidate and predictably manipulate the gene regulatory program of any microbe. In previous ABI-funded research, the Baliga lab developed a systems approach to reverse engineer the environment and gene regulatory influence network v2.0 (EGRIN 2.0) model directly from a compendium of transcriptome profiles. The EGRIN 2.0 model elucidates mechanisms for environment-specific transcriptional regulation of all genes with unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution, at canonical promoter locations and even within coding sequences and inside operons. Here, an approach will be developed to elucidate transcription factor interactions within EGRIN 2.0 and characterize how the topology of these interactions (i.e., 'network motifs') generates genome-wide, temporally coordinated transcriptional responses. These studies will be performed in the context of understanding how two phylogenetically distant organisms --Escherichia coli (a bacterium) and Halobacterium salinarum (an archaeaon)-- use distinct regulators to mediate physiologically different yet phenotypically similar transitions from aerobic growth to anaerobic quiescence. First, an approach will be developed to precisely map conditional binding of transcription factors to sequence elements within promoters of all genes in the genome (EGRIN 3.0). Next, EGRIN 3.0 will be used to identify, characterize, and manipulate topologies of transcription factor interactions (i.e., network motifs) to predictably alter oxygen (O2)-responsive state transitions in H. salinarum and E. coli. In addition to developing a generalized framework for manipulating a microbial gene regulatory program within any organism, the activities will test the hypothesis that similar environmental forcing drives convergent evolution of topologically similar network motifs in phylogenetically distant organisms. The high-level thinking and process used by this interdisciplinary group will be translated into curriculum and training experiences in the form of real-word cases studies for high school teachers and students. One of the goals will be for students to use experimentation and modeling to better understand the influence of environmental parameters (such as oxygen, nitrates, pH, light, etc.) on productivity and stability of food systems, such as aquaponic systems. Students, teachers, and STEM professionals will work together to iteratively develop and test curriculum and experiences through a modified Dick and Carey Instructional Design model. All curricula will be integrated with published national education standards. All needed technology, software, lesson plans and learning aides will be provided to teachers and students through multiple online sources, resource centers, and in-person and online trainings.

However, even though approximately half of biology majors complete coursework at community colleges (CCs), including disproportionate numbers of under-served students, only 3% of recent BER papers included a CC author or CC study context. This raises concerns that existing BER may have failed to characterize the educational experiences of half of the relevant undergraduate population and that innovations stemming from BER might not be reaching CCs. This project is a grassroots effort driven by a strong nationwide group of CC faculty to promote, conduct, and publish CC BER. The network will mobilize diverse stakeholders from CC settings including students, faculty and administrators to journal editors and national society leaders to enhance the representation of CCs in BER. Grounded in the unique values and cultures of CCs, it will provide opportunities for intellectual support, infrastructure support, and social support to mitigate previously hypothesized constraints on CC BER and empower CC faculty to engage in and publish BER. The project will thus address the paucity of BER from CC contexts and contribute insights that can improve life science instruction for students from underserved groups across all institutional contexts. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is to address research questions about the types of social, infrastructure and intellectual support CC BER. These networks will build on established models of change, provide answers to research questions regarding hypothesized constraints to CC BER, and integrate with existing networks. At the core of this national effort will be 20 geographically dispersed, regional CC BER networks. These regional networks, consisting of approximately five individuals representing CC faculty, administrators, students, future CC faculty, and CC BER advocates, will meet regularly and make substantial progress on one or more collaborative CC BER projects. The national network effort will provide intellectual resources in the form of faculty development experiences in BER at an opening national meeting, ongoing mentorship for regional networks, and travel to national BER conferences. Additionally, the network will provide critical resources often absent at CCs, such as access to an Institutional Review Board and journal articles. The project will culminate with presentations by regional teams at a national BER meeting and preparation of manuscripts related to regional efforts. As a result, the new CC BER network will make substantial, novel contributions to the present body of knowledge regarding CC biology teaching and learning and will provide insights into how networks can support innovation at CCs and in education research broadly.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)."

All engineering benefits from the use of standards. Examples include the standardization of screw and bolt sizes, standard voltages in computer electronic circuits, or internet standards that drive the World Wide Web. In each of these cases the use of standards has made many new industries economically viable which in turn has yielded enormous dividends to society. A nascent and growing community of synthetic biology researchers across industry and academia has come to recognize the value of standards, and worked together to develop the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), a standard that can describe biological designs constructed from DNA. This project will build from this starting place to (a) strengthen and extend SBOL so that it can serve a wider range of uses, (b) develop validation suites and services, so that systems can verify correct use of the standard, and (c) perform outreach and education to further grow and build our community of users and developers in both academia and industry. The key driving force for the development these standards will be the synthetic biology community. Our essential role is to put in place the means by which the whole community can benefit from a single standard that all can all agree to. <br/><br/>The project also has in place a number of outreach efforts that will benefit society directly. At the educational level, a special relationship with a community driven effort called HiveBio (http://hivebio.org/) will help high school students and laypeople understand modern biotechnology and molecular biology through hands-on classes. Every year the project will help fund up to 30 individuals to learn about genetic engineering, the techniques that scientists use in the lab and the ethical issues that we potentially face in biotechnology.  Two of the researchers on the project also publish undergraduate textbooks on synthetic biology and cellular modeling and will publish second editions of the books during the lifetime of the project.  The project will hold biannual meetings where researchers from academia and industry will be able to discuss future developments for the standard and to further build the community.  In addition to developing an active community website, the communities' work will be presented at workshops and cross-disciplinary groups engaged in work such as systems biology, and e-science. Project staff will also present at the Seattle science clubs where the general public can learn more about synthetic biology in general.

A LSM is an essential tool for studying cell and gene function in animals, plants, and microorganisms. The LSM also improves the quality and expands the scope of the research, training and educational activities in many scientific disciplines, including biology and chemistry. The new LSM will be housed in the Dewel Microscopy Facility (DMF) (http://casmifa.appstate.edu/) within the College of Arts and Sciences. The DMF serves as the core, multi-user microscopy facility for all departments at ASU as well as surrounding Appalachian communities, including high school students in western North Carolina. Principle investigators that use the facility train undergraduate and master?s level graduate students to utilize this imaging technique in coursework as well as research environments. On a broader level, ASU and the DMF support several programs that train college and high school students from underrepresented groups pursuing degrees. These programs include Upward Bound that provides academic support to high school students in the Appalachian region, the Forensic Program in the Department of Chemistry, and the Duke TIP for gifted middle and high school students. This instrument will also be used for other outreach programs at ASU, such as the STEM education program and annual NC Science Festival. This project will significantly enhance research productivity and educational opportunities at ASU. It will also strengthen ongoing services to communities and collaborations with other universities in the region. Thus, the new LSM will become an essential tool for current and future scientists as well as engineers in all of western North Carolina.<br/>      <br/>      The new instrumentation primarily serves users from the Departments of Biology and Chemistry at ASU for individual research, research training programs, and teaching. The five major research projects that use the LSM are multidisciplinary including investigation of the roles of microtubules in root development; study of the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms using zebrafish as a model system; research on the morphology and function of sensory neurons in Drosophila melanogaster; exploration of the biophysical processes behind the transport of negatively charged molecules through major facilitator superfamily proteins overexpressed in mammalian cell lines; and examination of the evolutionary transitions in the mechanisms of ammonia excretion in vertebrates.

While a technological revolution in systems neuroscience yielded a broad array of tools to observe and manipulate neural circuits, behavioral technologies have lagged behind. The problem of behavioral measurement and description is as complex as behaviors are diverse. To study behavior, laboratories employ complex behavioral systems, often in combination with custom-made hardware and software, and use these to define the tasks animals are required to learn and perform. As a consequence, the descriptions of behavioral tasks are tied to the hardware of each system, and there is no general, abstract description format to bridge across laboratories employing different systems. Building on insights from computer science, computational linguistics, and psychology, the goal of this project is to develop a formal language to describe behavioral tasks. This new behavioral task description language enhances accurate task design, improves reproducibility of existing tasks, enables widespread sharing and publication of task descriptions, and supports cross-system implementation. The project has broad benefits for improving scientific rigor and reproducibility in behavioral neuroscience. Moreover, the project reduces a significant barrier to sophisticated behavioral neuroscience experiments, putting them within reach of undergraduate class projects, and exposing students to a highly interdisciplinary approach, drawing on neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and linguistics.<br/> <br/>The project entails the development of a formal computer language that can describe all laboratory behavioral tasks in a platform-independent manner. Currently, behavioral tasks are described largely with a combination of flowcharts and textual explanation, beyond the specific software codes used to control behavioral hardware. These descriptions do not provide formal accounts that ensure identical re-implementation or the rigorous comparison of similarly described paradigms. In addition, the hardware-bound codes tend hide the logic of behavioral tasks. The objective of this project is to design a new language, an extension to finite state machine descriptions, that can serve both as abstract illustrations for publications and also ready-to-run programs to control hardware. The new behavioral task description language builds on the class virtual finite state machines, a finite state machine extension framework that was developed to provide software specifications for real-time control systems. Additionally, the new task description language introduces ways to encapsulate common design motifs so they can be treated as primitives and additional features to define trial structures. The consistent high-level description enhances behavioral task design, distilling critical features into an easy-to-understand and formally rigorous structure. To demonstrate the use of this language, a turn-key implementation, including a graphical editor, is produced. In addition, templates for an array of commonly used behavioral tasks are produced. The platform-independent behavior description language exposes the underlying behavioral task logic and makes it easier to describe, reproduce, and share behavioral tasks across laboratories.

This bequest stated that Meyer's Point should be used to promote environmental education, research, and the arts.  Meyer's Point currently boasts substantial natural resources including extensive terrestrial, wetland and aquatic habitats.  For the past 26 years, in keeping with this bequest, WSU and its many partners have utilized Meyer's Point for a range of environmental research, education, and outreach activities, including studies of shoreline native plants, marine invertebrates, butterflies, salt marshes and birds, water quality and ecosystem restoration.  But these prior research, education and outreach efforts have generally been 'stand-alone' projects and not well coordinated.  There is an opportunity to focus WSU's (and other institutions') research efforts in some high-profile and high-impact areas.  WSU, the state's land-grant research university, has growing expertise in three new thematic areas relevant to the urban/rural interface that could guide the build-out of Meyer's Point: 1) Water Science; 2) The Interface between Agriculture and Ecosystems; and 3) ""People and Place"" in the Arts, Humanities, and Sciences.  More broadly, WSU will adopt a consistent, intentional and interactive process at Meyer's Point for: 1) educating and training undergraduate and graduate students (e.g. hosting the ""New REU Site: Landscape Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics: Integrating Terrestrial and Aquatic Perspectives"" project), 2) engaging with K-12 teachers and students (e.g., the Olympia High School Earth Corps"" has for many years cleared invasive plants and re-planted native late-succession tree species over several acres of land at Meyer's Point), and 3) reaching out to engage and inform the public (e.g., Meyer's Point is currently home to a community-based, non-profit oyster farm collaborative, that educates and provides hands-on experience developing, managing and distributing fresh, native oysters harvested from the site).  <br/><br/>The overall goal is to build Meyer's Point into a leading environmental research, education and outreach center for the Puget Sound Area, and by extension, the state of Washington and the nation, that is focused on environmental issues at the urban/rural interface.  The three primary objectives for this planning grant are to: i) Learn about the needs, capabilities and aspirations of stakeholders, potential partnering institutions, and regional field stations, via a series of site visits; ii) Work with stakeholder and partner institutions to identify goals and outcomes for the next 5-years of growth at Meyer's Point, via a professionally facilitated workshop; and iii) Produce a detailed 5-year strategic plan that can guide WSU and its partners in facilities enhancement and fundraising for Meyer's Point."

VIERS has a 50 year legacy of serving generations of scientifically literate citizens, educators, and researchers. Research at VIERS provides one of the longest running insights into the changes affecting Caribbean reefs. Of central importance in the legacy of VIERS is its unique location in a US National Park in the eastern Caribbean, and the novelty of a fully-protected watershed. These benefits have been recognized by NSF through ongoing support of coral reef research, including most recently, efforts to quantify hurricane effects through RAPID grants. VIERS provides critical access to science infrastructure for underrepresented groups (Caribbean islanders) through a significant HBCU (i.e., UVI). Specifically, these advantages accrue through: (a) the global benefits of ensuring the longevity of an historically important field station at a time when such facilities are critically needed, (b) sustaining the capacity to mentor and train the next generation of biologists through real-world natural history experiences, (c) supporting research of national importance to the US to manage coral resources in one of the only areas of coral reef with MPA status in US waters, and (d) provision of education, research, and training opportunities for US Caribbean islanders that are chronically under-represented in science and education.<br/><br/>Damage caused by two Category 5 hurricanes (Irma and Maria in 2017) severely impacted the capacity to conduct research and education in St. John, US Virgin Islands. Many cabins and related buildings were displaced, flooded through, and severed from electrical and plumbing infrastructure. A two-phased restoration plan has be developed. Phase 1, to be supported by this grant, will construct new visiting scientist housing and work space in a location directly adjacent to the laboratory building which survived the storms. Phase 2 will be to restore the cabins damaged by the hurricanes, rebuilding them and re-setting them on their foundations. The investment in Phase 1 will restore research activities as quickly as possible.  Once Phase 2 is complete and the damaged infrastructure is replaced, this new structure will represent an expansion over previous housing capacity, serving researchers that need 24-hour access to the marine environment. This will put VIERS on a renewed trajectory of grown into research on the ecology of coral reefs, forecasting the future, and training scientists for the 21st Century.

The projects using this instrument will introduce a diverse group of researchers in the laboratories of the participants, including undergraduate co-op researchers at NEU and NEB, to cutting edge interdisciplinary science. Due in part to the participation of major users from Wellesley College and Bridgewater State University, women and researchers from underserved communities will gain access to new research experiences. The CTFM instrument will be incorporated into two major undergraduate courses at NEU, in which students will have the opportunity to use the CTFM instrument and to design and test mutations on DNA-interacting motor proteins. Biannual workshops to attract and train regional users will be run by Lumicks and hosted by Northeastern, and the instrument will be advertised widely.<br/><br/>The CTFM instrument will allow users to measure and apply tension to single biomolecules with sub-picoNewton resolution, and to detect the presence, number, and position of individual fluorescently labeled molecules during these measurements in real time. This allows users to push or pull on biological systems and observe the reaction of the systems to force by using fluorescent labels. Simultaneously, the users can ""feel"" the reaction of the systems to these inputs through measurements of force or extension changes as the system responds to these inputs. Importantly, these observations reveal interactions at very small length scales, revealing activities of single proteins interacting with a substrate. Innovative projects at the forefront of interdisciplinary science will be enabled by this instrument, including projects to study how cellular DNA replication and repair of DNA damage occurs, how retroviruses copy their genomes, and how DNA is packaged (and can be unpackaged) in cells. Studies on collagen will probe how force affects tissue repair, while studies on polymer dynamics will use force to observe and direct protein assembly. The results of these studies will allow observation of real-time biological dynamics at the single molecule level, providing significant new insights into the functions of the biological systems probed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrument will be able to completely analyze complex mixtures of molecules in microbiomes and in rapidly changing chemical environments. The microbes that live on and within vertebrates play a critical role in metabolism, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their influence are not well understood. This instrument will allow simultaneous monitoring of many molecules produced by these microbes. The same instrumentation will also be adapted to detect important, short-lived chemical species.  These highly reactive species play central roles in many chemical reactions - for example, in flames and in the atmosphere - but many have never been directly observed. Developing this instrumentation will also provide an ideal arena for an interdisciplinary collaboration in which undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, and chemical biology will learn about the challenges and capabilities of each other's areas of science.  Overall, advancing this technology will add a powerful technique to the suite of chemical analysis tools currently available to the microbiology and chemistry communities.<br/><br/><br/>Detecting, identifying, and quantifying the complex mixtures of volatile, reactive molecules found in microbiomes and many other chemical environments is a challenging and important problem. A host of sensitive mixture analysis techniques exist today, but no technique can definitively analyze gas phase mixtures with hundreds of components, and many methods require laborious adjustment for each new species to be analyzed. The analysis of short lived, reactive species is a particularly difficult problem, as most separation techniques operate too slowly to observe such molecules. Fourier Transform Microwave Spectroscopy (FTMW) is exceptionally well suited to this challenging analysis problem. FTMW works by exciting and then detecting narrow, highly specific rotational (microwave) resonances in gas phase molecules. Fingerprints of distinct species can be separated electronically, and physical separation or purification of samples is not required, even for mixtures with hundreds of components. The new instrumentation leverages recent advances in microwave spectroscopy techniques, cryogenics, and fast electronics to dramatically increase the sensitivity of FTMW.  The cryogenic techniques used here further provide one of the most inert chemical environments ever achieved, allowing for the stabilization and detection of highly reactive compounds. These reactive compounds play critical roles in many chemical environments, despite lasting for a small fraction of a second under typical conditions. The instrumentation will be adapted to study both complex mixtures produced in microbiomes and reactive mixtures produced in rapidly changing chemical environments. This instrumentation will allow scientists to unravel chemical environments of previously unmanageable complexity, providing an important new tool for studying a wide range of important chemical and biochemical systems. <br/><br/>This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Chemical Measurement and Imaging, in the Division of Chemistry"

A gateway  such as this helps  improve our understanding of how the brain works by making it easier for neuroscientists to use complex digital models of brain cells and circuits in their research. Powerful software has been developed for building and using models, and on-line resources such as Open Source Brain (OSB), ModelDB, Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), and OpenWorm have been created to help neuroscientists find existing models, collaborate in developing new ones, and share the results of their work with others. However, models are becoming too complex for the computer hardware that is available to most neuroscientists, resulting in a critical need to use high performance computing resources (HPC). This work extends an existing Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), which was developed with support from NSF to eliminate or reduce many of the technical and administrative difficulties that previously limited neuroscientists' access to HPC (http://www.nsgportal.org/). That said, NSG users must still log in, upload models, launch simulations, and download results--a process that involves many time-consuming, error-prone steps. The expanded NSG-R will eliminate these steps by enabling on-demand, automated communication between itself and familiar working environments including resources like OSB and others mentioned above, and even with neural simulation software running on neuroscientists' own laptop and desktop computers. <br/><br/>This seamless access to HPC is implemented in NSG-R by a software infrastructure that uses REpresentational State Transfer (""REST"", the R in NSG-R). NSG-R utilizes set of web services which expose the capabilities of NSG for access via publicly available application programmer interfaces. This will allow users of neuroscience resources such as OSB, ModelDB, NIF and OpenWorm to readily access HPC from their respective websites via NSG-R. This enhances the usefulness of NSG-R, other neuroscience resources like OSB, and widely used neural simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, PyNN, NEST, Brian and MOOSE. It also results in greater research productivity and enables wider use of large scale computational modeling by scientists and students. NSG-R will accelerate progress in brain science, and have far-reaching beneficial effects on related fields such as robotics and engineering of adaptive and learning systems. It will widen opportunities for educational and career advancement in neuroscience and engineering. Furthermore, by removing barriers that traditionally have limited access to HPC, NSG-R levels the playing field for all students and researchers regardless of their institutional affiliation. NSG-R, a free and open neuroscience gateway infrastructure, will naturally be a ready entry point for students and researchers from historically underrepresented schools and colleges. NSG-R workshops will be hosted at minority serving institutions (MSI) and opportunities for students to do internships with the NSG-R team at the University of California San Diego will be provided."

The fellow, Jaaved Mohammed, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Dr. Joanna Wysocka at Stanford University. The goal of this research project is to characterize craniofacial mutations (those of the head and face), and to understand their impact at the molecular level. The head and face are remarkably distinctive organs that set humans apart from each other and from other species.  Enhancers are a class of DNA elements that play important roles in craniofacial differences, yet mutations in enhancer sequences that underlie these differences remain poorly understood. This research project will benefit the scientific community, the general public, and individuals underrepresented in science and technology. First, the basic biology knowledge gained from this proposed work will be disseminated to audiences of varied technical expertise via journal articles, conferences, and print and social media. Second, this research will produce a database of DNA mutations that may be implicated in craniofacial disorders. Third, the proposed research will help our society learn about our distant ancestry. Specifically, it will address how DNA of Neanderthal origin, introduced into the genome of modern humans when our ancestors and Neanderthals interbred in ancient Eurasia, led to beneficial human adaptations and our increased risk of diseases. Finally, the fellow will mentor students underrepresented in science and technology in his research lab.   <br/><br/>To characterize nucleotide differences within enhancers that contribute to craniofacial differences across hominids via regulation of transcription factor binding, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression, the fellow will utilize Cranial Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs) and the Neanderthal genome. CNCCs are a relevant model for addressing this goal because CNCC derivatives become the embryonic face. Furthermore, the recent availability of the Neanderthal genome facilitates the study of human morphology and traits at a finer resolution, than comparisons to the chimpanzee. Using these systems, the fellow will employ an interdisciplinary strategy to identify enhancers that have evolved adaptively, to quantify the potency of enhancer variants on transcription exogenously, and to understand the effect of Neanderthal enhancers on CNCC behavior, and ultimately, morphology."

The fellow, Rebecca Prescott, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology, under the mentorship of two sponsoring scientists: Alan Decho (University of South Carolina) and Charles Cockell (University of Edinburgh). This project investigates how biofilms (thin films of microbes attached to surfaces and encased in mucus) survive in harsh environments on Earth and under a simulated early Mars environment. This is important because determining the range of planetary conditions that are favorable for life, detecting life on other planets, and understanding how life evolved on Earth are all important questions in astrobiology. The Fellow is focusing on how biofilms from hypersaline environments may survive through cooperative behavior and chemical communication among microbe cells (referred to as quorum sensing). The fellow is also determining what genes are regulated through quorum sensing, and investigating the response to the extreme environmental conditions these microbes endure on Earth and under simulated early Martian conditions. The questions of how life evolved on Earth are imbedded in cultural traditions across the globe, and the highly interdisciplinary field of astrobiology provides unique opportunities to develop and integrate indigenous cultural perspectives into K-12 classrooms. Thus, the fellow's broadening participation activities include working with the UK Centre for Astrobiology Summer Teacher Academy, and with science teachers from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, to develop teacher training workshops in culture-based science of astrobiology.<br/><br/>To enhance our understanding of where microbial life may occur on Mars, past or present, we must understand how microbial communities evolve and function in extreme environments. Quorum sensing is an ancient and well-documented mode of cooperative living, and is a mechanism that may enhance microbial survival in extreme environments. Quorum sensing has not been investigated in an astrobiological context, and this study will be the first to illuminate possible mechanisms of microbial interactions that could increase their adaptability to early Mars conditions on the surface or subsurface. Through collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, the Fellow is using the Planetary Environmental Liquid Simulator (PELS) to evaluate the genomic, transcriptomic, and lipidomic changes of hypersaline biofilm mats from the Bahamas (surface) and biofilms from the Boulby Salt Mine, UK (subsurface) when placed in early Mars conditions in the PELS. The fellow is testing the hypothesis that through cooperative behavior (i.e. quorum sensing), biofilms have an increased chance of surviving under multiple extremes, and evaluating whether the molecules of communication may be preserved in the rock record, providing clues to a community-level response to environmental extremes."

The goals of this Center are to develop a predictive understanding of biological and ecological toxicology for nanomaterials, and of their transport and transformation in the environment.  This Center engages a highly interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team in an integrated research program to determine how the physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials determine their environmental impacts from the cellular scale to that of entire ecosystems.  The research approach promises to be transformative to the science of ecotoxicology by combining high throughput screening assays with computational and physiological modeling to predict impacts at higher levels of biological organization.  The Center will unite the fields of engineering, chemistry, physics, materials science, cell biology, ecology, toxicology, computer modeling, and risk assessment to establish the foundations of a new scientific discipline: environmental nanotoxicology.<br/><br/>Research on nanomaterials and development of nanotechnology is expanding rapidly and producing discoveries that promise to benefit the nation?s economy, and improve our ability to live sustainably on earth.  There is now a critical need to reduce uncertainty about the possible negative consequences of nanomaterials in the environment, while at the same time providing guidelines for their safe design to prevent environmental and toxicological hazards.  This Center addresses this societal need by developing a scientific framework of risk prediction that is paradigm-shifting in its potential to keep pace with the commercial expansion of nanotechnology.  Another impact of the Center will be development of human resources for the academic community, industry and government by training the next generation of nano-scale scientists, engineers, and regulators to anticipate and mitigate potential future environmental hazards of nanotechnology.  Partnerships with other centers will act as powerful portals for the dissemination and integration of research findings to the scientific, educational, and industrial communities, both nationally and internationally.  This Center will contribute to a network of nanotechnology centers that serve the national needs and expand representation and access to this research and knowledge network through programs directed at California colleges serving underrepresented groups.  Outreach activities, including a journalist?scientist communication program, will serve to inform both experts and the public at large about the safety issues surrounding nanotechnology and how to safely produce, use, and dispose of nanomaterials."

The fellow, Leander Anderegg, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Todd Dawson (University of California-Berkeley) and Joseph Berry (Carnegie Institute for Science). The fellow is investigating how plants have responded to rising amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere over the past century, in order to predict how plants will respond to increasing human CO2 emissions in the future. Plants are like merchants: they essentially trade water to the atmosphere in exchange for the CO2 they need to produce sugars through photosynthesis. By burning fossil fuels, humans have changed the global carbon-water exchange rate in plants' favor by making it less water-expensive to 'buy' CO2 from the atmosphere. Theoretically, this could increase plant growth around the world, improving crop yields and increasing how much of our CO2 emissions ecosystems can absorb from the atmosphere in the future. However, recent observations suggest that this CO2 fertilization effect is far more limited and variable than previously thought. This research explores why CO2 fertilization responses are so complex, focusing on how drought stress and differences between plant species determine if and how a plant responds to rising atmospheric CO2.<br/><br/>The fellow is using hundred-year-old plant samples from museum herbarium collections along with modern samples collected from the same locations to reconstruct how tree species across California have responded to rising CO2. The fellow is comparing the morphology, anatomy and chemical composition of these historical and modern leaves to determine how trees have changed their physiology over the past century. The historical and contemporary records of plant responses to CO2 collected through this research are also revealing how CO2 fertilization varies across species and climates. The fellow is using this information, along with tree growth reconstructions from tree cores and mechanistic photosynthesis models, to understand how water availability and species physiology dictate tree responses to elevated CO2. This work is helping to reconcile the results of short-term CO2 fertilization experiments and long-term observations from tree rings of the exchange rate between water and CO2. A nuanced understanding of the plant traits and environmental conditions that lead to different CO2 fertilization responses will improve our ability to predict terrestrial ecosystem function under accelerating environmental change. The fellow is being trained in plant anatomical, isotopic and modeling techniques while also developing new methods for unlocking critical information from underused herbarium collections."

In nature, bioluminescence is used for prey capture, mate attraction and self-defense. This unique form of light production occurs when a small molecule combines with an enzyme to release photons.  Researchers have harnessed this distinctive form of living light production for a wide variety of uses, from measuring activity in cells by tracking light flashes, to controlling activity in cells by transforming bioluminescent signals into electrical current flow.  These tools are powerful for answering scientific questions, and may also prove useful as novel treatments, for example in stimulating specific areas of the brain or regulating heart pacemakers.  This NeuroNex Technology Hub advances science by innovating new bioluminescent technologies, and teaching others about it.  New innovations include the development of brighter chemical reactions, able to transmit signals farther across the brain, and the creation of new microscopes to harvest bioluminescent activity.  The Technology Hub also helps other scientists learn both the principles and the pragmatic details of how to use these methods in their own research, through workshops, emissaries sent to laboratories, and a comprehensive website.  An additional key focus of this project is on developing curricula for general education, from the grade school to the high school level, and on outreach projects within the broader community. <br/><br/>This NeuroNex Technology Hub enables bioluminescence use for cellular imaging and control.  Historical impediments to effective bioluminescence use included the prolonged time scale of light production and long recharging time (severe limitations in early calcium imaging attempts), and insufficient light production.  The Technology Hub and other recent advances directly address these concerns, for example through discovery of new molecules, development of novel strategies for conferring calcium sensitivity to bright and fast luciferases, and brightness amplification e.g., by resonant energy transfer.  All these innovations not only serve imaging, but also enable bioluminescence as a driver for optogenetic molecules, a new cellular control strategy termed BioLuminescent OptoGenetics ('BL-OG').  While BL-OG has already proven effective as a solution that allows chemigenetic and optogenetic control in a single molecule, the advances implemented here significantly elaborate and improve this functionality. The Hub role in providing technology transfer to other practicing scientists is tailored to the individuals seeking training.  This specificity in dissemination of pragmatic knowledge is achieved by designing workshops at Brown University around the needs of attendees, and through sending bioluminescence-trained technicians and students directly to laboratories to demonstrate and trouble-shoot experiments.  The comprehensive website lists existing bioluminescent options, where they can be acquired, and aggregate bibliographic references.  In all activities, the Hub team seeks active input from the user community to ensure that the knowledge being disseminated is of use to advancing the exact goals of practicing scientists.

High-throughput whole slide imaging (WSI) system is an important tool for various biological research applications. By using WSI systems, large-scale biological samples can be digitalized with high resolution in seconds or minutes, significantly increasing laboratory efficiency and promoting the progress of science. This project aims to develop a $100 WSI add-on kit for high-throughput multimodal microscopy imaging. By adapting this add-on kit to an existing regular microscope platform, one can convert it into a high-throughput, multimodal WSI platform. The result from the WSI add-on kit is a comprehensive digital rending of the entire sample, on the order of centimeter in size, visible at diffraction-limited resolution, in two or three dimensions, and with multiple imaging modalities. Experiments that were typically carried out manually in single cell level and addressed a limited field of view at a time can now be done for the entire sample in an automated and intelligent manner. As high-content images are desired in many fields of biological and biomedical research, the dissemination of the WSI add-on kit in ~$100 budget could lead to new types of experimental designs in small research labs and benefit various health-related applications.<br/>  <br/>This project aims to develop the WSI add-on kit by integrating three different modules: 1) an autofocusing module that instantly identifies the optimal focal position of the sample, 2) a scanning module that drives the stages of a regular microscope in high speed, and 3) an illumination module that integrates multiple imaging modalities into the platform. For the autofocusing module, two pinhole-modulated cameras will be attached to the eyepiece ports for instant focal plane detection. By analyzing the captured images from these two eyepiece ports, one can infer the optimal focal position for a 2D thin section and the tomography structure of a 3D sample without a z-scan. Different z-sampling strategies can then be used for better image acquisition. For the scanning module, stepper motors and the associated gears will be used to control the motion of the microscope stages. Different mechanical coupling schemes will be tested and the best scheme will be chosen in terms of the scanning speed and positional repeatability. For the illumination module, a liquid crystal display will be inserted at the back-focal plane of the condenser lens. By setting different binary patterns on the display, this illumination module is able to integrate multiple imaging modalities into the platform, including brightfield, darkfield, phase contrast, quantitative phase, polarization, 3D tomography, and super-resolution Fourier ptychographic imaging. The education/outreach program of this project will include course development for graduate and undergraduate students at UConn, summer internships to high-school students and high-school/middle-school teachers. The knowledge generated through this project will be disseminated through conference presentations and workshops, publications in scientific journals, and news-room articles that raise the scientific literacy of the public. The protocol of building the WSI kit will be posted on a dedicated website. Industrial partners will be identified to promote the commercialization of the WSI add-on kit."

The facility will also improve undergraduate and graduate education at universities in the Houston metropolitan area, including those that lack major research infrastructure, such as UH Sugar Land and the University of St. Thomas. Graduate and undergraduate students will have increased opportunities to participate in research at the facility. Classes taking field trips to the UHCC will be able to view the wetlands and discuss experimental science and the ecological importance of wetlands. On occasions when some wetlands are not in use for research, they will be available for sampling by student groups conducting field activities. The benefits of improved undergraduate and graduate education at the UHCC will be particularly important for under-represented minorities. UH is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and the second most ethnically diverse major research university in the United States, and UH Downtown also has a very diverse student body. The facility will also improve public education by providing new opportunities to discuss experimental research, flood control, and the value of wetlands with K-12 and other public groups visiting the UH Coastal Center.<br/><br/>The project will consist of an array of wetlands at the University of Houston Coastal Center (http://www.uhcc.uh.edu/). The wetlands will be excavated ~1.6 m below the soil surface at a site dominated by non-native grass and trees. A membrane will line the bottom of the ponds, which will be back filled with some of the excavated soil. The remaining excavated dirt will be used to form berms around the wetland edges. The wetlands will be individually plumbed and controlled with remotely-operated valves, allowing easy filling, draining, and control of water level. Because the water level will be adjustable, each wetland can be filled or drained to function as a pond, wetland or wet grassland as needed for different research projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reproduction takes energy and energy production induces the release of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mitochondria. ROS are normal byproducts of cellular respiration that can damage cells and as a result, reduce longevity. Yet, several studies have now shown that damage from ROS is typically unchanged or even reduced in animals that reproduce compared to those that don't.  In addition, new theory suggests that low levels of exposure to ROS, as occurs during reproduction, not only lowers damage from ROS but may also protect cells from the cellular damage that contributes to aging. The goals of this project are to test if the ROS generated during reproduction protects against future ROS damage, determine how ROS damage and the performance of mitochondria change with reproductive experience and age, and characterize the relationship between reproductive experience and longevity in the house mouse.  Research on the interaction between mitochondrial function, reproduction, and longevity will be used as a platform for education and the improvement of science literacy in the state of Alabama. In collaboration of with local biology teachers, lesson plans with labs will be developed for 7th and 9th graders. These lessons will feature the proposed research on mitochondria and aging and will be submitted to the Alabama State Board of Education for adoption in every 7th and 9th grade biology classroom in Alabama. In addition, Auburn graduate students will be challenged to commit to regular participation in outreach in a graduate-level seminar ""mitochondria and energetics"". Students will prepare and present a lesson for Auburn University's Get Under the Surface program that invites 5th grade students and their parents to campus to participate in an interactive laboratory. <br/><br/>The goals of this CAREER project are to 1) test whether reproduction protects against future oxidative damage and 2) to determine if mitochondrial function and the cellular response to an induced oxidative stressor change with age in a continuously breeding species, the house mouse (Mus musculus). Given the potentially protective effects that reproduction has on processes that induce aging, a third goal of this project is 3) to evaluate the interaction between reproduction and longevity in female mice by comparing age at death in females that have bred few times verses those that have bred many times. Several cutting-edge techniques will be employed in this investigation including measurements of ROS production from mitochondria and oxidative damage in organs that commonly decline during senescence. In addition, respiratory control ratio, electron chain complex activity, mitochondrial biogenesis, abundance of uncoupling proteins and levels of endogenous antioxidants will be evaluated. The impact of treatment on insulin-like growth factor-1 and telomere length will also be evaluated as indicators of the impact of treatment on aging. This investigation will provide a detailed assessment of the role that reproduction plays in the accumulation of ROS and in resistance to stressors that hasten aging. Unlike many studies that have searched for a mechanistic basis for the tradeoff between reproduction and longevity, this study will ask whether such a tradeoff really exists. Whether this study supports or refutes the idea that ROS produced during reproduction contributes to age, the project will transform the study of life-history evolution, and the outcome will be a better understanding of the mechanistic relationship between aging and reproduction."

Our current prosperity and our future success hinge on recruiting, training, and employing the creative and industrious STEM professionals who drive the innovation economy. Strengthening the American STEM workforce depends, in part, on broadening participation to students from demographics that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM. This NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project will foster recruitment, training, and employment for indigenous STEM students, where the term ""indigenous"" comprises the terms Native American, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian Native. Specifically, this project will support the design and development of a first-of-its-kind network focused on environmental stewardship of indigenous lands. The network will comprise both tribal and government partners and will be organized by three faculty at the University of Colorado-Denver. Student recruitment, training, and employment will be organized around the unifying principle of land stewardship. The focus on land stewardship has been selected not only because it demands the expertise of STEM professionals, but also because land stewardship is among the top motivations for indigenous students considering STEM careers. Accordingly, this work is important on several fronts: It addresses the recognized need for STEM professionals; it broadens participation to students from underrepresented groups; and it provides a test bed for collective action by a first-of-its-kind network of tribal, government, and university partners.<br/><br/>The proposed network will work together to design, deploy, and debug a unique educational program giving students an opportunity to train for employment as tribal liaisons in the environmental field. In particular, this program will address the need for culturally-sensitive, scientifically-trained individuals who can serve as tribal liaisons between tribal and non-tribal organizations, which will allow them to prevent, minimize, or manage environmental incidents through their understanding of STEM principles and organizational dynamics. All students in this educational program will earn a regular four-year STEM degree, but a key feature of the program is that they will also participate in training and internships designed to provide background with nontechnical matters such as cultural awareness, environmental regulations, and organizational dynamics. Additionally, this educational program is designed to support recruitment of indigenous students by (1) providing a clear vision of a high-impact, culturally-relevant professional career and by (2) providing a cultural connection with obtaining a college degree. Taken together, the network aims to increase enrollment, retention, graduation, and alumni activity by indigenous students. Best practices and strategies for collective impact will be used to document achievement of the network in increasing the enrollment, retention, graduation, and alumni activity of indigenous students in higher education and in STEM careers.  Continuous feedback will be collected to assess partner engagement and durability, and student satisfaction, performance, and progress.  The network is expected to be sustainable because it addresses a demonstrated need; it is expected to be scalable because scientifically aware, culturally-sensitive individuals who can serve as tribal liaisons are needed not only regionally, but nationally."

Such decision making, however, is not always easy to study or understand because a number of factors can bias behavioral choice in dynamic ways (for example, fluctuating neurohormones or environmental conditions). Even in simpler invertebrate animals, with a reduced number of brain neurons, the operational state of their neural networks is neither easy to follow nor predictable. Thus to solve some of the most pressing questions in the field of neuroscience, technological advances must be made so that the functioning of brains can be studied under more naturalistic conditions. To this end, a team of scientists in engineering, nanoscience, chemistry, computer science, and biology will work together to design, fabricate and test a novel brain recording and stimulation device that, in parallel, will detect fluctuations in neuroactive substances. The team will begin by making prototypes of the device and testing it on leech and insect brains that have fewer neurons, but have well defined correlations between nerve cell activity and behaviors. The team is committed to the interdisciplinary cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students, especially females and underrepresented minorities. The goal of team mentoring is such that students will be well versed in both the biological and engineering aspects of the device. School visits are also planned to engage K-12 students in neuroscience, chemistry and engineering-related demonstrations, encouraging them to participate in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The cross-disciplinary team will fabricate and test a novel multi-electrode integrated ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) device and chemical sensing system having high temporal resolution. Patterned brain activity will be collected in parallel with neuromodulatory substances such as dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and octopamine (OA). The team's aim is to fabricate a device that will be 2 x 2 mm square, micron-level thin, flexible and biocompatible for extended use, with a minimum of output wires; our future goal will be to develop a completely remote sensing/monitoring capability. Such post-fabrication modification will be conducted at the University of Minnesota's Nano Center. Furthermore, the team aims to identify conserved neural algorithms or rules for context-dependent decision making that span the invertebrates (leech and honey bee) to non-human primates. Fabricated devices will be placed: 1) around dorsal and ventral aspects of the brain of the leech while it makes a decision to crawl or swim (DA and 5-HT-dependent switching); 2) over the Kenyon cells of the honey bee brain during a modified PER (proboscis-extension) learning-and-memory task (potential DA, 5-HT, and OA involvement); and 3) over the Prefrontal Cortex of monkeys during a spatial-cognitive task that will mimic one used for the honey bee (measuring DA changes)."

The new instrumentation is unique in many aspects, and it is anticipated that it will play a major role in developing new approaches for high-throughput cellular analysis, which are in high demand in biology and medicine. One of the thrust areas of emerging applications for this instrument is lipidomics. Microbes (both natural and engineered) that can convert biomass into oil offer the promise of achieving sustainable oil production and enhancing domestic energy independence. The newly developed instrument will substantially enhance the University infrastructure by uniting several Colleges, Institutes and Centers. This project will support broader impacts that promote the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the general public. Specifically, this project will provide research opportunities and training for highly motivated undergraduates across several colleges and research disciplines; provide unique educational opportunities for students from the Texas Rio Grande Valley and the United States-Mexico border region, which includes the most economically disadvantaged areas of the country according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications, public presentations, tutorial, and hands-on training seminars. Finally, findings from this research will be disseminated to the public through broadcasted segments on ""Invisible Jungle"", an undergraduate-produced radio program that is carried weekly on the local National Public Radio Affiliate, KAMU radio (College Station, Texas).<br/><br/><br/>Identification, classification and sorting live cells are activities of considerable research and commercial interest. Chemical composition and elasticity in cells play an important role our classification and our understanding of function. Conventional analysis of the chemical composition of cells involves the use of molecular labels or analytical approaches that destroy cell viability. Similarly, the conventional analysis of biomechanical or elastic properties of biological materials involves labor intensive and slow approaches. No commercial instrument exists to assess those properties at a high throughput rate (>1000 cells per second) and non-invasively. The potential demand for such instrumentation is enormous, since almost every research/industrial/clinical lab relies on cell sorting. By providing additional capabilities, the newly developed instrument will also fill existing gaps in instrumentation. Innovations in scientific instrumentation often share several key features. First, these innovations perform measurements that were previously impossible. Second, they perform analyses at low cost with unprecedented throughput. Finally, instrumentation innovations address an important scientific need. Here, we will develop a transformative technology platform that contains all of the hallmarks of innovation in scientific instrumentation, and as such, has the potential to significantly advance life science, biomedical and engineering research. The overall instrument will be composed of two parts: (1) an optical sensing unit optimized for (a) chemical analysis of cells by means of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy, and (b) biophysical measurements of elasticity in cells through coherent Brillouin scattering; and (2) multifunctional microfluidic devices providing standardized platforms for cell delivery, sorting, and in situ validation of cell?s elastic properties. The newly developed instruments will also be validated using biological samples."

The Nature Coast spans the Big Bend of Florida on the Gulf of Mexico (984,000 acres) and contains one of North America's least developed coastlines, with extensive seagrass meadows, valuable recreational and commercial fisheries and healthy populations of marine mammals, waterbirds, and sea turtles.  The Nature Coast Biological Station (NCBS) is a new modern laboratory and education center created by the University of Florida in 2017. This new laboratory is the only one of its kind for 416 kilometers of the U.S. Gulf Coast.  This project will install a modular seawater delivery and filtration system at NCBS that will serve the wet lab and public education/aquarium area.

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Colin Donihue is ""Human-driven evolution of European lizards."" The host institution for this fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Jonathan Losos.  <br/><br/>The research investigates whether and how human-caused land use change has instigated evolutionary changes in the morphology of 15 European lizard species that are known to live within human-built environments. Humans have been transforming landscapes for centuries. Some species are capable of rapidly adapting to human-wrought changes, while others are not. Understanding the capacity to adapt would inform fundamental questions in evolution and shape future conservation action. Using lizard specimens collected over the last 150 years, and archaeological remains deposited over the past 10,000 years (concurrent with humans? expansion through Europe) the Fellow is comparing lizards spatially, temporally, and phylogenetically to understand the extent to which they have adapted to human land use. The Fellow is producing the first cataloguing of a large collection of lizard remains from archaeological sites in Europe, creating an extensive database of 3D scans of specimens and archaeological material, and providing new insight into the predictability of human-driven evolution.<br/><br/>The Fellow is receiving training in the latest approaches to morphological analyses, including tomographic analysis, virtual dissections, and cutting-edge micro-CT scans. The Fellow is developing collaborations with European scientists, training and mentoring high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the U.S, and developing educational outreach material for a broad audience. The project culminates in an interactive web map showing human land use through time in Europe paired with interactive 3D scans of lizards from different time periods and contexts, which will engage the public and serve as a valuable resource for middle and high school science classrooms."

KU has an extensive history of paleontological research and collection stewardship back to the late 1800s. Paleontological collections represent an invaluable resource for studying past biodiversity and tracing the evolution and relationships of groups of organisms through time. Such collections represent an irreplaceable record of past life and their proper maintenance is especially crucial in cases where collection sites are no longer accessible, where they contain evolutionarily important organisms, or represent a unique record of Earth history. This project will provide funding for a compactor storage system for fossil plant specimens that are currently in unsuitable storage and inaccessible. The KU Paleobotany Division has a long, successful history of outreach programs that use specimens from the collection. Activities that this project will engage in include: recruitment/retention of underrepresented minority and female graduate/undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars; workshops for middle school girls using female role models and hands-on science activities; subject-based (paleobotany, environmental change, Antarctica) workshops for various groups (TRIO program for inner-city students from Kansas City; home-schooled students; gifted students from Topeka PS); participation in Natural History Museum Public Education programs (fossil identification day, Darwin Day); collection tours; public lectures; permanent and temporary displays in the Museum; and teaching paleobotanical techniques to school children and the public. This project will include a Museum Studies student who will develop a virtual exhibit based on the newly accessible fossils.<br/> <br/>The paleobotany collections have greatly exceeded current space in Haworth Hall (biology labs, offices) and specimens are scattered in storage areas and the paleobotany research laboratory. Specimens will be moved into newly renovated space on West Campus, where many other Natural History collections are housed. The Paleobotany Division contains more than 100,000 specimens. KU houses the largest collection of Antarctic fossil plants in the world. These fossils provide calibration points for molecular clocks, molecular phylogenies, and extinction and dispersal events. The current project includes Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic fossil plants from Antarctica, and orphaned collections from Ohio University (OU), which were moved to KU in 2012. The latter includes Paleozoic plants from Appalachia and the Midcontinent, as well as Oxroad Bay, Scotland. Together with collections already at KU, this acquisition forms an unparalleled resource of the history of seed plants, from the earliest accepted fossils to the evolution of modern groups. The OU collection also includes plants from rare, seasonally dry (""upland"") floras from North American communities during glacial times in Gondwana; some of these sites are no longer accessible for collection. The Antarctic fossils that need proper storage represent a unique, anatomically detailed record of Paleozoic - Mesozoic plants and fungi at a time before and after end-Permian extinctions - the largest extinctions in Earth history. The Jurassic plants represent the only substantial deposit of Jurassic plants on continental Antarctica and are an important record of plant diversity and paleoclimate at the time of the breakup of Gondwana. Results of project will be shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and made available online (biodiversity.ku.edu/paleobotany)."

It will greatly facilitate a variety of behavioral, ecological, population genetic, environmental, and evolution research projects and research-training of undergraduate students. This instrument will replace an earlier generation labor-intensive single capillary instrument, and permit quick adoption by numerous faculty at UT.  UT is primarily an undergraduate institution and currently engaged in a campus-wide initiative which provides funding assistance to faculty to convert courses to include student inquiry. The biology department has long been dedicated to maintaining high levels of involvement by undergraduates in faculty research. Graduating senior exit surveys indicate that 60% to 95% of graduating students have been involved in research outside the classroom. Thus it is not surprising that 40-50% of graduating seniors indicate that they wish to continue in graduate or professional programs in STEM fields. Undergraduates majoring in biology are nearly 75% female; 22% are members of underrepresented ethnic or racial minorities; and 14% are first generation college students. These ratios are reflected in the investigators' research laboratories, and funding assistance exists to further encourage underrepresented students to participate in research. Further, all of the investigators carry out research that emphasizes environmental science and that informs conservation decision-making. Therefore, acquisition of the SeqStudioTM will expose the next the generation of scientists to cutting-edge research and instrumentation and increase STEM as well as environmental competencies and our global competiveness.<br/><br/>The SeqStudioTM Genetic Analyzer is a four capillary electrophoresis instrument for separating and visualizing DNA bases and fragments. Each of the six investigators carry out research on wild organisms, the focus of which spans questions that can be answered using DNA techniques from the behavioral level, to the population level, to the phylogeographic, to the species delineation and identification level, and even to the deep phylogenetic level. Studies include conservation, ecological and evolutionary genetic studies on a variety of wild animal species, characterizing the retinal opsin genes and expressed proteins from marine vertebrate, the evolution and diversification of male parental care in fishes, the reproductive behavior of fish, and the ecology and distribution of seahorses and pipefishes in Tampa Bay, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. The SeqStudioTM has the capability of running DNA sequences, fragment analysis (genotyping), and SNP genotyping, and will permit expanded capabilities for research labs on campus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PGSC maintains and distributes outbred stocks of Peromyscus. In addition, it provides biological samples of various species, such as fresh, frozen and preserved tissues, DNA, fecal and blood samples and in response to external requests performs small-scale research projects to facilitate the research needs of external investigators. In view of the continuing need for transparency and reproducibility in science, the PGSC provides a consistent and uninterrupted supply of animals with verified quality, health, genetic and physiological status. The PGSC also operates as a focal point for Peromyscus associated research and provides training for undergraduate and graduate students, and other investigators using Peromyscus in research.<br/><br/>The deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus and congeneric species are the most common native North American mammal.  They range from Alaska to Central America and occur in many natural habitats. Because of their abundance, these animals constitute a major component of nearctic terrestrial ecosystems.  The PGSC maintains genetic and phenotypic variants drawn from the geographic variation present in wild populations of deer mice in the genus Peromyscus. These stocks provide critical resources for the study of genotype to phenotype relationships, local adaptation, and evolution in natural populations.  Some of the clearest evidence of natural selection and adaptation have come from studies of deer mice.  Peromyscus has emerged a model of choice for the study of major biological processes such as speciation, adaptation and stress response, behavior adaptation in the context of physiology and evolution, host-parasite interactions, microbiome-associated studies and others.  The stock center enables these studies by providing living stocks for quantitative genetic and genomic analyses to identify the genes underlying ecologically important, adaptive phenotypic variation and make predictions about population evolutionary response in a spatially variable and temporally changing environment.  The Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center (PGSC) maintains and distributes outbred stocks of Peromyscus and several behavioral and coat-color mutants for research.  In addition, it provides investigators with biological samples of various species, such as fresh, frozen and preserved tissues, DNA, fecal and blood samples and in response to external requests performs small-scale research projects to facilitate investigator's research needs.

The Center serves a key role, both nationally and internationally, in training biofilm researchers and also has a strong track record of broadening the participation of women and Native Americans in engineering and science through its research programs that emphasize hands-on research education. Currently, one of the most pressing challenges in microbiology is to identify roles for individual microorganisms in complex, native habitats. Raman microscopy is a novel way to study the contribution of individual microbes in complex environments that range from human and environmental health to agricultural productivity and ecosystem functioning.<br/><br/>Raman is a vibrational spectroscopic method that provides a fingerprint of the molecular composition of a sample. A cell's Raman spectrum contains information about its identity, physiological state, metabolic activity, and health/disease state. MSU faculty and students will use the Raman microscope to characterize the physiology, activity, and ecology of cultivated and uncultivated microbes in their native state in a large number of ecosystems, including geothermal springs, deep-sea sediment, and industrially and medically relevant biofilms. The ability to use Raman for fast and non-destructive analyses will allow living cells to be analyzed. This will enable downstream experiments such as cell separation followed by molecular analyses. The acquisition of this instrument enables the expansion of MSU faculty into novel research trajectories and help them transition the field of microbiome research from correlative studies to causal understanding of microbial function."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow utilizing biological collections in innovative ways. Piranhas and their allies number almost 100 species and despite deceptively simple jaws, these fishes consume prey ranging from whole fishes to plant matter like nuts, fruits, and leaves. Researchers can understand how and why biomaterials and structures have changed by studying the history of predators and their prey, and noting which behaviors, structures, and materials keep evolving in tandem (evolutionary convergence). The first step in understanding how anatomy has evolved is building an evolutionary genealogy (phylogeny) of living piranhas, pacu, and their relatives to use as a framework. This project will then examine how the feeding anatomy of piranhas and their allies is constructed, how these structures perform when feeding on different prey, and map these traits across the evolutionary history of these fishes.<br/><br/>The fellow will construct a cutting-edge phylogenomic tree for serrasalmid fishes using targeted exon capture methods. These evolutionary relationships will be used as a framework for understanding feeding trait evolution, visualized through iodine-enhanced contrast staining coupled with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).  The fellow will use biomechanical modeling methods like FEA (finite-element analysis) to examine how different skull shapes resist stresses during feeding, and quantify feeding performance by analyzing muscle morphology and jaw lever dynamics measured from micro-CT imaging. This project proposes that the skulls of piranhas will show evolutionary trade-offs among cranial architectural strength, tooth shape, and feeding performance. Certain combinations of these traits will also be correlated with specific diets like scale-eating, fruit-eating, and piscivory, among others. This project utilizes molecular collections from museums to further our understanding of the evolutionary relationships of charismatic fishes like piranhas. Morphological imaging of museum specimens will generate a database of piranha CT models for teaching and outreach methods, free for anyone to download and 3D print. Training goals include the fellow gaining experience in some of the most advanced techniques for visualizing anatomy and modeling the material and architectural behavior of these structures. Broader impacts include educational outreach targeting university and pre-university students with speech disabilities, engaging these student's interests in science, and reinforcing their confidence and ability for entering academia and other research-based professions.  Results from the studies will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared at scientific meetings."

This project recognizes that both innovative scientific research and wider societal participation are needed for effective and equitable solutions to environmental issues that directly impact societal well-being and national security. Both research and policy are enhanced by full participation of all sectors of society. Despite the existence of multiple programs over many years, barriers to the participation of underrepresented minorities in ecology persist. One overarching systemic issue remains critical: that insufficient connections among programs result in breaks along critical transition points in career pathways. Project activities will lay the groundwork by developing a regional approach to alliance-building that can be extended across the nation. <br/><br/><br/>Ecology+ will use a collective impact framework -- characterized by a common agenda, shared measurement, mutually reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and backbone support -- to optimize career guidance and support for undergraduate students, graduate students and early career technical and professional scientists. Starting in the Washington-Baltimore region, key objectives of the project are to develop infrastructure for effective communications among partners with the capacity to expand nationally; map potential career pathways with associated sets of necessary competencies, opportunities and mentors, and; empower alliance participants to overcome institutional barriers and patterns of unconscious bias. Ecology+ will: a) establish an online mentoring platform; b) offer a career fair with motivational talks and guidance on individual career development plans; c) offer a series of relevant skills workshops; d) arrange research or internship experiences, and; e) facilitate awareness and networking opportunities with employers from agencies, business and nonprofit sectors.  The value of Ecology+ lies in its comprehensive, integrated approach that will bring new partners and their resources into a transformative and systemic response to the key barriers affecting underrepresented minorities in science."

The fellow, Daniel Urban, is conducting research and receiving training that utilizes biological collections in innovative ways, and is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Nancy Simmons (American Museum of Natural History) and Karen Sears (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The project aims to understand the origination and diversification of novel traits, specifically bat wings. The wing membranes of bats are novel structures with no known associations to features in any other mammals. Additionally, the importance of the wing membranes cannot be overstated as they have allowed bats to diversify in an extraordinary manner - bats account for over 20% of all mammalian species. While conducting this research, the fellow is training and mentoring several undergraduates from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, while utilizing the wealth of knowledge in museum collections in innovative ways. Furthermore, the fellow is broadening public engagement by generating hands-on learning activities at the American Museum of Natural History, which have the potential to reach over 5 million children and adults annually. <br/><br/>The fellow's research consists of three primary aims. Aim 1 characterizes varying wing forms among diverse bat species. This aim is being achieved by conducting wing shape analysis on adult specimens housed at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), which contains over 60,000 bats in its collection. In Aim 2 the fellow is identifying when during development the wing membranes begin to form, and from what tissue sources they originate. The fellow is also determining at what point differences in the wing forms begin to emerge among species. Aim 2 specimens are being acquired from a combination of AMNH fluid collections and newly captured bats (which will then be added to the AMNH collections). Finally, Aim 3 seeks to establish the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of the wing membranes, and how these mechanisms diverge among various species. This aim uses developing embryos to visualize cellular processes, gene expression, and protein localization. Identifying the mechanisms driving the origination and diversification of bat wing membranes will advance our understanding of bat development and evolution and, more generally, the developmental drivers of evolutionary innovations and adaptive radiations. In the process, the fellow is also generating outreach activities to assist in educating the public about the importance of bats and their amazing novel wing structures."

To best serve the growing VESR constituency while perpetuating VESR as a resource, this project will develop a long-term (five to ten year) strategic plan for VESR research, education, outreach programs, and facilities. The strategic plan will articulate a scientific vision for research and educational use, and an evaluation of the programs, facility needs and resources necessary to support that vision. The goal of the strategic plan is to enhance research and education activities at VESR as well as the regional coordination of research, education and outreach activities across the Sierra Nevada region through a network of regional agency, non-profit, academic and field station partners.<br/><br/>The planning process involves engaging with key stakeholders through virtual and in-person workshops to identify regional coordination opportunities. The strategic plan will direct the prioritization of facilities and programs enhancements, and access for researchers, students, educators and natural resource managers in the eastern Sierra Nevada. The involvement of an Environmental Science Masters level student in this process will provide graduate student level training in biological research, environmental management and related fields. Engaging with regional coordinators at workshops supported by the proposed planning process represents a formalized step in establishing a regionally coordinated node representing the Eastern Sierra Nevada that can more effectively participate in larger scale global observatory or climate change research efforts. The strategic plan and planning process will contribute to ongoing dialogue, and directly benefit several land and wildlife management agencies with jurisdiction over the Sierra Nevada, whose need for information to inform land management has increased markedly in recent years due to persistent drought conditions and other environmental stressors."

These changes in the environment have cumulative biological effects, and a great deal of research shows how each one separately affects many marine species. What is needed next is a set of experiments on how these environmental factors act when they act in combination with each other. This project will establish a new multi-user experimental facility at Hopkins Marine Station that will provide independent control of seawater temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and acidification. These units will allow researchers to expose marine species to the wide range of physical conditions found naturally in upwelling ecosystems, and to alter those conditions to match future predictions. The proposed facility will enable training in experimental biology and climate change science for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students at all Monterey Bay institutions, K-12 outreach programs, and a training program for graduate students from the University of Puerto Rico. A major component of the proposed training activities is through collaboration with faculty at California State University Monterey Bay in supporting broad participation of underrepresented minorities, women and first generation college students in independent research and course-based projects.   <br/><br/>The impact of multiple environmental stressors acting together on marine species has been hypothesized to be more than the sum of the impacts of single stressors alone. Yet this hypothesis has not often been tested across a range of species that naturally experience multi-stressor environmental impacts. The proposed facility will enable researchers at marine institutions in the Monterey Bay area to conduct the next generation of multi-stressor experiments with a suite of benthic and pelagic marine invertebrates and fishes that are relevant to local ecosystems and environmental variability. This project will address this issue by establishing a new multi-user experimental facility at Hopkins Marine Station (https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu) that will allow independent control of seawater temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and pH over a range of parameter values that regularly occur in Monterey Bay and the offshore waters of the California Current System. The facility will include 40 independently controlled 189-liter aquaria and is based on successful construction and experimental use of four fully working prototypes. Thirty-six units will be added as part of this project. Four 500-liter round tanks to facilitate the study of small pelagic fishes and squid, and a small-tank system designed to allow the rapid change of multiple physical parameters through mixing of controlled water volumes for experiments on pelagic squid and fishes that involve equipment-intensive electrophysiological and biomechanical approaches will be components of the system to be employed. Experiments conducted in this facility will be analyzed through a wide range of modern tools including advanced genomics, neurophysiology, analysis of species interaction strengths, and ecosystem modeling. Overall, these facilities will provide an unprecedented ability to conduct collaborative joint experiments on a wide range of ecologically and economically relevant species and will support a creative and comprehensive research program on the effects of changing physical parameters on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the future oceans."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The proposed research seeks to better understand the symbiotic bacteria that live inside the cells of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a major role in the nutrient absorption for almost all plants on the globe. The pursuit of more productive, sustainably produced crops requires the manipulation of plants, from breeding practices to genetics to modifying the microbes associated with them. AMF provide dramatic benefits to plant growth, making them important organisms to understand for the benefit of agriculture. It was only recently discovered that almost all AMF have unusual bacteria living inside of their cells. These bacteria form a symbiotic relationship with the AMF,  but these bacteria are not well studied. This research will provide critical insight into the identity and function of these bacteria. The project will involve undergraduate researchers at Cornell University from programs that increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. The fellow will also produce a course on fungal symbioses that will serve as a model for active team-based learning methods and shared online as an open educational resource.<br/><br/>To study the bacteria of a wide range of different AMF, the research relies on the extensive collections of the International Culture Collection of Arbuscular (Vesicular) Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University, the largest collection of living AMF strains in the world. The Fellow will receive training in the use and upkeep of such strains. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) use single-fungal-cell next-generation DNA sequencing to sample the diversity of bacteria present in members of all known lineages of AMF; (2) produce phylogenetic analyses of DNA from selected endosymbiotic bacteria and AMF and compare their ancestral relationships, in order to discover historical patterns of association; and (3) analyze genomes of selected endosymbiotic bacteria to find clues to their function. This research is potentially transformative because we do not yet understand these bacteria and how they might benefit or disadvantage the fungus-plant symbiosis.  This work will also benefit INVAM by providing additional information about its accessioned strains and by serving as a model study for the necessity of its collections. The Fellow will also develop necessary experience in genomics and continue their broader scientific narrative in the evolution of symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the financial, engineering and computational barriers to new brain mapping technologies are far beyond the reach of most laboratories and even universities and institutions. A NeruoHub at a national lab, Argonne National Lab (ANL), could provide widespread access to such technologies. Specifically, the Hub will leverage the brightest hard X-ray source and one of the fastest computers at ANL, to provide mesoscale maps that detail the locations of every cell, their shapes and ultimately their connections with each other in large volumes to entire brains.  The Hub will craft these technologies for brain mapping across diverse species, specifically the nervous system of the octopus.  Enabling comparative studies across brain regions and species like the octopus will provide insights into what is general and what is idiosyncratic, and can reveal novel solutions when applied to species with distinctive perceptual or behavioral capabilities. Finally, the Hub will nurture and develop the relationship between neuroscience and the national lab system. For decades, many other fields of science have benefitted from strong collaborative relationships with the national lab system, leveraging large-scale resources to significantly advance their respective fields. Neuroscience has not. The Hub will establish the first pipeline for providing access and introduction to the broader neuroscience and national lab communities, paving the way for future collaborations.  <br/><br/><br/>The technical approach is to develop sample preparation protocols for staining large volumes to entire octopus brains with heavy metals (e.g. osmium, lead, and uranium), embedding in plastic, and imaging with synchrotron source micro- and nano-x-ray microscopy followed by automated serial section electron microscopy.  Development of new protocols will leverage existing protocols and imaging approaches for mammalian brains while also developing capabilities at ANL for 100nm resolution projection x-ray microscopy. Where possible, reconstructions of neurons and their processes from micro- and nano-X-ray datasets will be validated with automated large volume serial electron microscopy. In tandem existing machine learning algorithms used for tracing neurons and their processes will be scaled onto Argonne High Performance Computers for analyses of X-ray datasets."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Explanations for the spectacular success of fish are complex and must account for many factors. To advance this field, this project investigates extinct and living species of pufferfishes, boxfishes, triggerfishes, ocean sunfishes, and allies called tetraodontiforms that include some of the most extreme body shapes in the Fish Tree of Life. These body types range from nearly square to globose, and spheroid to laterally compressed. Tetraodontiforms harbor the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date and one the best-known and well-studied fossil records among fishes. Recent evidence suggests that diversification dynamics (speciation and extinction) in this group are linked to a period known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (ca. 50 Ma). It is still unknown, however, how this event or other paleoclimate changes affected their body shape evolution over time.<br/><br/>This project will synthesize a comprehensive, all species, tetraodontiforms phylogeny, by quantifying morphological evolution using 3D morphometrics and body size diversity by leveraging biological collections. It will characterize the evolution of candidate genes associated with body size change in tetraodontiforms, and use comparative methods to test how morphological evolution contributes to tetraodontiform fish diversification.  Aside from scientific endeavors, these funds are also being used to contribute to community-driven scientific efforts, student training, and public outreach. Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate student from underrepresented minorities constitute a core goal of the activities of the project. Outreach activities include the participation in a long-term program for Chicago disadvantaged youths through the Project Exploration Sisters4Science Program, and lectures at existing programs at the University of Chicago, such as Saturday Scientist and their active Women In Science programs. This project will also broadcast knowledge on fish diversity through a variety of social platforms and at scientific meetings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Emily Lescak is ""Effects of Chronic Exposure to Low Levels of Antibiotics on Development of Threespine Stickleback Fish."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Alaska Anchorage, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Milligan-Myhre.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study short- and long-term effects of chronic exposure to low levels of antibiotics on microbial community diversity and host development in a genetically variable fish species, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a model organism for understanding the impact of environmental contaminants on vertebrate physiology. Vertebrate host/microbe interactions are crucial for nutrient absorption, somatic growth, and immune system development. Disruptions to the microbiota, such as those caused by antibiotics, can therefore have both immediate and long-term effects on host physiology. Low levels of more than a dozen types of antibiotics have been detected in waterways in the United States and Europe. However, little is known about how chronic exposure impacts host-microbe interactions in aquatic vertebrates, like fish, or how host genetic background influences the response of the microbiota to disruption. The Fellow is testing the hypotheses that 1) the levels of antibiotics found in the environment are sufficient to disrupt microbial community composition, which will result in changes to timing of organ development, growth, behavior, and inflammatory state, and 2) that there will be individualized responses to antibiotic exposure due to differences in host genetic background. The Fellow is rearing stickleback from two genetically distinct populations at low levels of antibiotics and in a control (untreated water). Microbial diversity, inflammatory state, and physiological and behavioral development are being compared at a series of key developmental time points until reproductive maturity is reached. Results will help elucidate how gut microbial communities respond to chronic disturbances, how critical aspects of vertebrate physiology may be disrupted by antibiotic exposure in the environment, and how host genetic background influences susceptibility to short- and long-term changes in microbial diversity and development. <br/><br/>In terms of training, the Fellow is 1) learning new techniques in bioinformatics, histology, and microbiology; 2) developing immune response assays; 3) mentoring students. The Fellow is giving presentations on her research and career training to K-12 students in Anchorage, Alaska. Furthermore, she is training high school students through the Anchorage School District's mentorship program and identifying undergraduate and graduate trainees through the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program and BUILD EXITO. By establishing the University of Alaska Anchorage's first postdoctoral association, the Fellow is organizing professional development for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Thus, the Fellow is engaging trainees of all levels from diverse backgrounds in research important to ecosystem health."

The fellow, Sarah Schreiner, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Jeffrey Moore at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus. The fellow aims to uncover how cells build a diverse set of structures and transport networks out of the same protein building blocks called microtubules. If a city highway is built improperly, it causes traffic jams that can disrupt the basic functioning of the city. Similarly, if microtubule networks are built improperly, it can disrupt basic biological functions including cell division and tissue development. The results of this proposal will improve our understanding of how cells build microtubule networks into diverse structures and transport networks, and how these contribute to normal cell function. Additionally, the fellow is broadening participation of underrepresented groups by developing and delivering a public lecture series for local libraries and high schools.<br/><br/>The research goals of this proposal are to determine how specific tubulin subunits are selectively targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the effect that these PTMs have on microtubule assembly and network organization. In order to study PTMs on microtubules, a source of unmodified tubulin is necessary; however, there are currently no methods to produce unmodified tubulin in an in vivo setting. The project aims to create a new experimental system in which PTMs can be studied on microtubules in a 'clean slate' system in yeast to study the targeting and effect of PTMs on microtubules. The proposed research is starting to tease apart the very complex process of how the cell can differentially regulate the same building blocks to accomplish many diverse and essential biological processes.  The lecture series is providing the public with a better understanding of the current issues they hear today by de-mystifying the science behind them, and training young scientists on how to communicate complex scientific issues in a fun and engaging way to a public audience."

The fellow, Rebecca Helm, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by two sponsoring scientists at two host institutions: Ann Tarrant (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), and Allen Collins (Smithsonian Institution). The fellow's research examines animal evolution and development, using jellyfish as a model system. Many animal species that change shape during development ('metamorphose') are economically important to humans, including jellyfish, which impact power plants, fisheries, tourism, and human health. For example, blooms of jellyfish can make coastal waters unsuitable for swimmers, and compete for food resources with economically important fish. For most of their lives, 'true jellyfish' (scyphozoans) look nothing like our image of a typical jellyfish. Scyphozoans are found year-round as 'polyps,' which look more like small sea anemones. When seasonal conditions are favorable, these polyps develop into many small juvenile jellyfish, with a shape more like a 'typical' jellyfish. The fellow is studying the environmental and chemical factors that trigger jellyfish to change shape, and the genes associated with these triggers. The goal of this research is to provide insights into the cellular mechanisms of jellyfish production as well as potential genetic tools for predicting jellyfish blooms. <br/><br/>To understand scyphozoan metamorphosis, the fellow is using diverse methods, including pharmacological, histological, sequencing, and functional techniques. The fellow is using pharmacological agents to trigger or inhibit jellyfish metamorphosis and then identifying genes associated with these responses. Furthermore, the fellow is using functional molecular techniques to test the role of different genes in metamorphosis across different species. The resulting research will provide critical insights in the cellular mechanisms of jellyfish metamorphosis and the role that different compounds, including potential pollutants, may play in this process. In addition to providing the fellow with training in scientific techniques, the fellow is training and mentoring high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM. The fellow is receiving mentorship training, and mentoring an undergraduate research student from an underrepresented group in STEM through the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program. The fellow is also collaborating with a middle school educator to lead a marine biology student group project related to the fellowship research. This project will be part of a middle school oceanography club, composed of 61% female students, 23% Hispanic students, and 24% Native American students, in the fellow?s hometown of Flagstaff, Arizona. Combined, these efforts provide students with an opportunity to access and participate in real science as it happens."

To further recruit a diverse range of students to STEM disciplines, videos showing the inner workings of plant and animal tissues will be developed and presented in Clark County K-12 classrooms. Similar presentations for Science Café Las Vegas will enhance scientific literacy by introducing the lay public to the fascinating behaviors of cells within living tissues. <br/><br/>The newly acquired multiphoton laser scanning microscope provides advanced technology to obtain images from living tissues to depths of 1 mm. This instrument will be located in the UNLV Confocal and Biological Imaging Core, so that it will be available on a first-come, first-served basis to scientists and students across Nevada. Availability of this instrument eliminates the barrier of transporting samples to other states, and enables Nevada researchers to study living systems at new levels of sensitivity and depth. The high-speed imaging technology decreases tissue damage and increases sensitivity, allowing detection of fast-changing processes over periods of seconds to hours. This type of imaging is driving unexpected discoveries about the brain and how cells work together to build the architecture of many other organs. The advanced capabilities of multiphoton laser scanning microscopy will be used to study a wide range of biological and engineering systems, such as hormonal control of gland secretion, electrical oscillations in living mouse brain slices, repair and regeneration of eye tissues, organization of bio-fouling bacteria, and electrical activity of polymers for robotics and nanotechnology."

This instrumentation is the state-for-the art for chemical characterization of extremely complex mixtures and will be used in a wide variety of applications that range from alternative fuel research to disease research and fundamental biology. This instrument will be used to describe the chemical composition of complex mixtures to help improve the manner in which biomass is cultivated and processed into fuel and will be a key component to multiple health-related research projects including the imaging of live cells. Given the wide range of applications where the instrument will be used, this research will generate both novel applications and significant advancements in the application of this technology. Finally, the collaborative research projects that use the Orbitrap Fusion will provide a framework for discovery that will improve the ability of our institution to recruit and retain excellent faculty and will provide enormous opportunity for student participation in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The purpose of this acquisition is twofold. First, this acquisition will enable mass spectrometry-based proteomics for a number of collaborative research projects. Modern proteomic capability is currently absent in the state of New Mexico. The Orbitrap Fusion instrument architecture includes three orthogonal fragmentation techniques (electron transfer dissociation, collisional dissociation and higher energy collisional dissociation) and multiplex-in-time ion fragmentation capability, all of which are critical for modern quantitative proteomics and the analysis of protein post-translational modification. Second, with respect to multiple current research efforts in energy, environment and lipid applications, the Orbitrap Fusion offers excellent mass accuracy, ion transmission efficiency across a broad mass range and high resolving power for complex mixture analysis with collisional and higher energy collisional fragmentation methods to aid structural elucidation. Within those project areas, we will utilize the Orbitrap Fusion for the analysis of bio-oils and fuel precursors from biomass thermotreatment and upgrading, algal growth media and feedstocks, lipid mixtures from various biofuel feedstocks and complex environmental samples."

Historically, marine labs have played a leading role in providing a broad range of animal models that have been used to answer some of the most fundamental questions in biology, and neuroscience. For example, a fluorescent protein isolated from jellyfish has revolutionized our ability to image the mammalian nervous system and a nerve cell from squid has taught us how electrical signals are created in the brain. Biological research benefits when it embraces diversity. This is because each of the tens of millions of species that exist on earth offers a different insight into a specific biological process. Marine species have existed for much longer than their terrestrial counterparts, and have evolved to occupy far different environments. Accordingly, they offer unique opportunities for science. None of the current major genetic models is a marine organism. This initiative will create a genome editing core facility (GEC) at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL http://www.mbl.edu) in Woods Hole which will catalyze the production and development of genetically tractable marine models. This will enable new avenues of genetic research on diverse topics.<br/><br/>Having the facility at the Marine Biological Laboratory will maximize its effectiveness and impact. Every year over 1500 scientists and students visit the Marine Biological Laboratory to conduct research or attend courses, and all of them will have access to the genome editing core facility. The core facility's purpose is to allow the MBL's large community of researchers and students to deliver genome editing reagents to embryos from diverse marine organisms. The facility will consist of three microinjection rigs, apparatus to fabricate injection pipettes, and an electroporator. The rigs will be flexible. They were designed by expert embryologists with years of experience injecting marine embryos and will accommodate specimens that differ in size and material properties. GEC will be housed in the Marine Resource Center, a facility equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to culture a wide variety of marine organisms, including the genetic models that we propose to develop. Because the facility will be open to the entire MBL community, it will be used for both research and education. GEC will support the MBL's strategic aim of creating genetically tractable marine model organisms to catalyze the next generation of novel research in marine biology."

The fellow, Talisin Hammond, is conducting research and receiving training that increases the participation of groups underrepresented in biology, at the University of Pittsburgh, and is being mentored by Cori Richards-Zawicki (sponsoring scientist). This research explores how the reproductive behavior and physiology of multiple species of frogs is affected by chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease that has decimated many amphibian populations. In addition to improving our understanding of how this disease impacts amphibians, which are currently highly threatened by numerous environmental factors, this work also clarifies the role of sub-lethal effects of disease on population dynamics and evolutionary processes.  As part of this project the fellow is working with a natural history museum to teach student groups about science using sketch-noting. The fellow is also designing a research-based educational module, which will be freely available, and is working with an online network to find educators interested in its implementation. Finally, the fellow is mentoring diverse undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Wildlife diseases impact populations both directly, through mortality, and indirectly, through sub-lethal changes to host biology. Disease-induced fatalities can be devastating, but sub-lethal changes in behavior and physiology also have the potential to exert substantial pressure on populations. The terminal investment hypothesis, which states that animals with decreasing future reproductive potential should invest more in immediate reproduction, predicts that sick animals with decreased longevity should elevate reproductive effort, and that species with higher susceptibility should increase effort more. The fellow's research is testing this hypothesis, focusing on chytridiomycosis as the disease agent. The processes by which this disease kills amphibians are better-understood than its sub-lethal impacts, and few studies have experimentally described how chytridiomycosis impacts reproductive behavior and physiology. This project uses three congeneric frog species with differing disease susceptibility, using call recordings, behavioral choice tests, and hormonal manipulations in conjunction with quantifications of pathogen load, immune function and spermatic traits to characterize how the disease affects male reproductive behavior and physiology, and female preference. This work is generating novel insights into the role of sub-lethal, disease-mediated behavioral and physiological effects on individuals.  In addition to providing training support for the fellow in a new field of study, this work also involves significant outreach, including teaching student groups visiting natural history museums, developing a research-related, online-available educational module, and mentoring diverse undergraduate students."

They document Earth's biodiversity in the past, present, and hold species that are new to science. These collections make invaluable contributions to the classification of organisms, and more broadly to public health and safety and security of natural and agricultural resources. They are also tools for monitoring environmental change that affect the human condition. Entomological collections are especially important because insects represent the most diverse and abundant group of animals. Insects are ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with more than a million species worldwide. Insect collections are organized and maintained only through specialized knowledge and experience of curators and collections managers which has historically passed directly from one curator or collection manager to the next since no formal program existed to do this in a broader, more comprehensive fashion. This generational knowledge transfer is especially amplified at small to medium-sized collections, representing ~70% of all insect collections in the U.S. Despite their size, these collections are often extremely valuable because of strong regional, ecological or geographic foci. Currently, there is no training program available in collections management for insect collections, suggesting that an urgent need exists to develop a comprehensive program in best management practices for small to medium-sized collections. Such a program would also provide a much-needed networking opportunity for collections managers at different career stages and at different sized institutions to interact and share their experience and knowledge.<br/><br/>This award supports the first Entomological Collections Management Workshop Series, co-sponsored by the Entomological Collections Network (ECN) and the Systematics, Evolution, and Biodiversity (SysEB) Section of the Entomological Society of America (ESA). The inaugural workshop is scheduled to take place at the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC, on July 18-20, 2016, and continue annually thereafter. During the three-day workshop, participants will receive hands-on training in entomological collections management topics including collections management policies, specimen handling, curation, storage, conservation and more. This project will encourage participation of collections managers and students associated with smaller collections with more limited resources for training and collection development. This workshop will especially help the largest and fastest growing segment of underserved groups of students and early career researchers, including females, Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans, by providing opportunities for professional development leading to a higher skilled, technically-trained workforce. The results of this workshop will be posted on the ECN website at http://ecnweb.org/default.asp?Action=Show_Workshop and presented at the ECN annual meeting in Orlando, FL on September 23-24, 2016."

As evolution is the ultimate tinkerer of living systems systematic comparisons of how regulatory networks evolve to drive species-specific differences are critical to understand cellular functions. Through advances in genomics, it is now possible to measure the activity levels of almost all genes for many species. This provides a unique opportunity to systematically compare these gene activity levels across multiple organisms and link changes in activity to changes in the networks of individual species. However, this is challenging because, first, such comparisons require the regulatory networks to be known in not one but multiple species including those that are poorly characterized, and second, computational methods to compare molecular datasets across species other than DNA sequence are in their infancy. This project will address these challenges by developing novel computational methods to identify and compare regulatory networks across multiple species. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to establish a comparative network biology framework to study evolutionary dynamics of regulatory networks. In Aim 1, algorithms for regulatory network reconstruction that combine probabilistic models of evolution with network reconstruction will be developed, that take into account both sequence and expression determinants of regulatory networks. The network reconstruction algorithms will incorporate structural constraints of regulatory networks such as modular organization, where sets of genes are coordinately regulated to achieve specific cellular functions. In Aim 2, methods to identify and correlate regulatory network patterns of divergence to phenotypic states will be developed. In Aim 3, methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be applied to published and newly generated expression datasets in yeast and land plant phylogenies to study the evolution of stress response, carbon metabolism and plant-microbe relationships. Network predictions will be interpreted and tested by yeast and plant collaborators in the laboratory. This research project intersects several computational (graph theory, algorithms, machine learning) and biological (gene regulation and evolution) areas of research, providing an excellent training opportunity for scientists at the interface of these areas. The planned outreach activities include developing a Network biology course, and network biology boot camp for a broader audience including high school teachers. The PI will organize summer research internships in Network biology for undergraduate students from underrepresented and minority groups through the Computational Biology and Biostatistics Summer Research Opportunities (CBB SROP) at UW Madison, and participate in general public outreach from the Town Center at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (a public venue for regular school field trips and Science festivals).

The Fellow will investigate the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces shaping the differences between males and females, which are fundamental to the origins and maintenance of biological diversity. The Fellow will leverage the natural variation in the chromosomes that determine male vs. female in geckos to test classic evolutionary theory. The chromosomes that determine male vs. female are specialized chromosomes that trigger male or female development, and occur in two major systems. In XX/XY systems like humans, XY individuals are male, but in ZZ/ZW systems, ZW individuals are female. This fundamental difference in inheritance has sparked major theoretical predictions about the contrasting genetic mechanisms and evolutionary pressures shaping XY versus ZW systems. The Fellow will use geckos, which have evolved XY and ZW systems multiple times, to examine untested classical predictions using a novel and state-of-the-art comparative approach. The Fellow will broaden student participation in bioinformatics activities that explore genome biology and computational science, and will develop networking opportunities for underrepresented students seeking international research experience.<br/><br/>XY/XX and ZW/ZZ chromosomes arise as recombination is suppressed between a pair of autosomes, which subsequently diverge from one another in sequence and expression.

The Fellow will conduct a comparative analysis of XX/XY and ZZ/ZW chromosome evolution using multiple independently evolved gecko XY and ZW systems. The Fellow will test the role of chromosomal inversions in recombination suppression between these chromosomes, and how cessation of recombination differs between XY and ZW systems. Next, the Fellow will investigate how recombination, selection, and drift shape divergence in these chromosomes.

Within these sequences lie the molecular underpinnings of species differentiation. Presently it is not possible to systematically compare homologous genes from different species and predict which have changed function. New mechanistic models that describe the underlying population genetic, evolutionary, and biochemical processes and constraints on amino acid change between species will be developed and applied to genome comparisons, including to the divergence between humans and chimpanzees. Additionally, the project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral training. Further, a popular video, interactive educational website, and poster-based museum exhibit on comparative genomics will be produced to explain the concepts of comparative genomic analysis to a popular science audience. The project involves collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History and researchers at University of Otago in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Current widely used approaches in comparative genomics simply look for a statistical excess of nucleotide changes that change the encoded amino acid, normalized by the expectation from synonymous nucleotide changes (the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates), but do not look at amino acid biochemistry or structural biology. They also do not consider genome structure (linkage) or population genetic considerations of the probability of fixation of an amino acid change. This research will develop approaches that explicitly consider the linkage of sites on chromosomes in a population genetic model and in different ways, also consider the biochemical and structural context of amino acid changes. The new models will be used initially in comparisons of the human and chimpanzee genome protein coding set and will subsequently be implemented in a phylogenetic context to enable comparison of gene families from multiple species. Potential downstream applications of this modeling approach that enables better mechanistic understanding of lineage-specific evolution include prediction of proteins or pathways where functions have changed. This can point to proteins and pathways that make a species unique as well as validating when model organisms are likely to be good models for particular molecular systems.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. A major consequence of climate change is increased temperature variation; however, most studies addressing temperature variation in climate change use constant temperatures and focus on adult organisms. This is problematic because many traits important to survival (e.g. metabolism) are not only temperature-sensitive, but are differentially affected by constant versus fluctuating temperatures. Further, developmental life stages may be more sensitive to temperature variation than adult life stages. This research will compare how developmental and adult life stages are affected by temperature variation, and the potential role of parents in mitigating the degree of temperature variation experienced by young. Findings from this work will enhance predictions of animal responses to climate change and ultimately aid conservation and management decisions.  A key facet of the program will be carried out by high school students in the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) during a summer STEM camp developed and led by the PI, her sponsor, and collaborators in the EBCI. The summer STEM camp will be evaluated and revised during the fellow's tenure, so that an effective outreach program can be implemented annually following the conclusion of the fellowship. <br/><br/>This work will determine if (1) temperature variation differentially affects organisms throughout ontogeny, and (2) assess the role of parents in mitigating the degree of thermal variability experienced by young. This project will utilize Onthophagus taurus, which exhibits discrete life stages and suites of parental effects, like variation in sub-surface brood ball burial depth. Brood ball burial depth may significantly contribute to the degree of thermal variability young experience during development, potentially affecting thermal sensitivity of metabolism, survival, and fecundity, ultimately influencing responses to climate change. To address the first research objective, the fellow will measure: (a) metabolic costs incurred under fluctuating temperatures, (b) degree of thermal plasticity, and (c) potential costs associated with mounting thermally plastic responses across life stages.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  This project is aimed at understanding how and when different circuits in the brain interact to facilitate associative learning.  All animals rely upon learned associations between environmental stimuli and the outcomes they predict for functions such as navigation, foraging, selecting mates, and avoiding predators.  Associative learning requires coordination between multiple circuits in the brain and the neurotransmitters (signalling chemicals) to facilitate these behaviors. Therefore, to develop a better understanding of how the brain controls complex behaviors, it is necessary to determine how different brain circuits interact.  This fellowship will support the research, training, and career advancement of a fellow from an ethnic group underrepresented in STEM, while also enabling the fellow to provide mentorship, outreach and educational tools to underserved high schools.<br/><br/>One neural pathway that plays a central role in mediating associative learning is the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which projects from the midbrain to the striatum. Preeminent theories of dopamine's role in signaling learned associations between stimuli are based upon studies of mesolimbic dopamine neuron firing patterns during associative learning, and the assumption that cell firing and neurotransmitter release are correlated. Recent studies in brain slices, however, have demonstrated that acetylcholine, released by striatal cholinergic interneurons, can regulate dopamine neurotransmission at the axon terminal, effectively uncoupling dopaminergic neuron firing and neurotransmitter release. The fellow will address the need for systematic characterization of the function of this regulation mechanism, and its role in associative learning, by performing in vivo studies with the following objectives:  1) Determine how physiologically relevant cholinergic interneuron firing patterns modulate striatal dopamine release in vivo.  2) Determine how pauses in cholinergic interneuron firing, which are known to occur during associative learning, alter striatal dopamine release triggered by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli, and impact learning related behavior.  Through this work, the fellow will receive technical training in the use of genetic tools to isolate specific cell populations, optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, mouse behaviour, and surgical techniques, as well as professional development support.  Furthermore, the fellow will develop and employ a neuroscience workshop to immerse high school students from backgrounds underrepresented in science in the scientific process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Repetitive DNA makes up a large fraction of the total DNA in most organisms. Although it has sometimes been called ""junk DNA"", studies show that repetitive DNA is critical to many processes including how genes are regulated, genome evolution, aging, and disease. Despite its critical role, repetitive DNA is understudied. This is largely because software programs available for studying repetitive DNA can be difficult to use and their performance has not been compared against uniform standards of success. This project aims to address these challenges and simplify the process for scientists to study repetitive DNA using the best available programs. As scientists can better study repetitive DNA and its role in aging, cancer, and other processes affecting human health, society will in turn benefit. This project will place the fellow in an ideal setting for studying repetitive DNA alongside leading experts in the field. The project will also deliver career building opportunities to five students from underrepresented groups by engaging them directly in the research, and will promote mentorship of additional students within the department. Added diversity of individuals in science improves the quality of scientific research, and benefits society as privilege gaps close and individuals of all backgrounds have access to their desired careers.<br/><br/>The applicant will build a workflow for benchmarking transposable element (TE) annotation programs against well-studied animal, plant, and fungus model species. Using simulated and empirical datasets generated from these models, the applicant will evaluate a panel of available TE annotation programs to measure their effectiveness at annotating TE insertions across model species, and across TE families. Following performance testing, the best-performing programs will be wrapped into a pipeline designed to be portable and easily expandable. The applicant will demonstrate the utility of this pipeline by profiling repetitive DNA in a diverse family of beetles (Carabidae) to test hypotheses of transposon biology in the group. Students mentored under the project will be trained in basic command-line and bioinformatic skills, as well as molecular bench work including DNA extraction and library preparation.

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Erika Calvo is ""The role of neurogenesis in the functional recovery and morphological remodeling of the zebrafish olfactory bulb following lesion."" The host institution is Western Michigan University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christine Byrd-Jacobs. This project aims to understand the mechanisms of brain repair in zebrafish, an animal with an extraordinary regenerative potential. Specifically, the Fellow is studying the role of the generation of new neurons in brain repair and recovery following damage. This research will advance the current knowledge and understanding of mechanisms of adult brain regeneration, repair and recovery of function following injury, as well as the contribution of newly generated neurons in these processes. Furthermore, this research has implications for improving human health since it could lead to transformative strategies to stimulate neuronal regeneration and integration into damaged brain areas. These strategies could aid to achieve enhanced repair and recovery in injured human brains after stroke and traumatic brain injury. In addition to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of brain repair, the Fellow is broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in biology by actively recruiting, teaching and mentoring young Latino students through promoting a multi-collaborative platform between different Latino advocacy organizations. These outreach activities will assist in the recognition, fostering and advancement of promising Latino scientists that might otherwise be overlooked due to language, cultural and economic barriers, thus broadening their participation in higher education and in biology.<br/><br/>The Fellow is studying the hypothesis that following damage in the olfactory bulb of zebrafish newly generated neurons mature and integrate into lesioned neuronal circuits to repair the tissue and promote recovery of olfactory function. To study this, the Fellow is investigating: 1) loss and recovery of olfactory function after damage of the olfactory bulb, by means of olfactory mediated behavior tasks; 2) repair of the lesioned olfactory bulb, by means of histological, stereological and cellular analysis; and 3) the role of neurogenesis in mediating repair and recovery of olfactory function of the lesioned olfactory bulb, by means of behavioral and histological analysis following specific neurogenesis ablation. This project includes the following training activities for the Fellow: mastering the use of a model of brain regeneration and laboratory technical skills, as well as developing expertise in teaching, mentoring and scientific communication. Furthermore, the Fellow is undertaking wide-ranging mentoring, teaching and outreach activities that will expose students from underrepresented groups, particularly Latinos, to science in order to promote their recruitment and participation in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellow, Jinae Roa, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Colin Brauner at the University of British Columbia. The fellow is investigating how animals use signals produced by individual cells to maintain proper function of vital organs like the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver. The research focuses on cellular mechanisms used by fish from naturally extreme environments, and the results will provide critical information on how animals sense and repair conditions that negatively affect organ function. During outreach activities, the fellow is supporting the diverse local community by volunteering as an educator for an inner-city Science 101 program and by leading interactive hands-on activities at the Vancouver Aquarium. In addition, the fellow is training and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students. Upon completion of fellowship activities, the fellow will seek employment at a US institution whose primary mission includes increasing and sustaining diversity, where the fellow can serve as a role model and mentor for young women and students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The primary aim of this study is to investigate for the first time the cellular mechanisms responsible for sensing and regulating intracellular pH (pHi) in fish that preferentially regulate tissue pHi instead of blood extracellular pH (pHe). Limiting acid-base stress is an important function of vertebrate physiological systems as it reduces harmful exposure to hydrogen ions (H+), which negatively affect essential functions such as metabolism. However, information is lacking on the mechanisms by which pHi is sensed, what ion channels are involved, and if there is any whole-animal hormonal influence on preferentially regulated tissues. To address these questions, the fellow is investigating acid-base sensors in whole tissues in a fish species that is a preferential pHi regulator (white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus). In addition, the fellow is creating primary cultures of cells isolated from heart, muscle, and liver tissues of white sturgeon to study mechanisms for acid-base sensing and regulation, testing the following hypotheses: (1) preferential pHi regulation is facilitated by the evolutionarily conserved acid-base sensor soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC); and (2) preferential pHi regulation is influenced by whole-animal processes and thereby reduced in cultured cells."

The project will also stimulate cooperative relations with industry to transfer innovations into applications. The dissemination plan offers a pathway from proof of concept to commercial development. Partner biologists at the University of Colorado will help validate the new instrument. The project has identified commercialization pathways that include development through a startup company, partnering for manufacturing and distribution, and exploring licensing agreements. The project also integrates interdisciplinary education and outreach with research and development. It will provide training to young scientists and engineers with opportunities for interdisciplinary research in microscopy labs. The outcomes of the project will be widely disseminated in publications, via outreach to the general public and middle school students.<br/><br/>The system overcomes limitations of traditional optical confocal scanning techniques by providing higher resolution and faster imaging. The new capabilities are realized using minimally invasive fluorescence techniques. Because biologists are currently constrained by the limited spatial - temporal resolution, and/or depth penetration of existing optical microscopes, the applications of the proposed instrument are far-reaching, with use in tracking changes within multi cellular structures, as well as in monitoring interactions between molecules."

The fellow, Jennifer Hellman Johnson, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is being mentored by Alison Bell (sponsoring scientist). The fellow's research explores how offspring development is altered by maternal and paternal exposure to the stress of predation, prior to fertilization. Recent advances in biology have demonstrated that parental experiences can be transmitted to future generations without changes in underlying DNA sequences. These parental effects may cause changes in the appearance of offspring, which allow individuals to cope with the change. Alternatively, the multigenerational nature of these parental effects may mean that damaging stressors encountered by one generation can persist for multiple generations, even after the stressor has passed. In either case, understanding the influence of parental transmission of experiences prior to fertilization, and the underlying mechanisms, will improve the ability to predict how organisms adapt to variable and stressful environments. This research is elucidating if maternal and paternal stress prior to fertilization alter offspring in similar ways, whether maternal and paternal influences are additive or synergistic, if parents' experiences reverberate through the generations, and what potential mechanisms underlie these parental effects. <br/><br/>Using a well-studied fish species, the threespined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), the fellow is generating offspring with either no predator-exposed parents, predator-exposed mothers, predator-exposed fathers, or predator-exposed mothers and fathers. The fellow is measuring offspring and grandoffspring for differences in morphological and physiological traits and behavior. Further, because sperm and egg non-coding small RNAs have been increasingly recognized as an important epigenetic mechanism by which parents can influence offspring, the fellow is injecting embryos with maternal and/or paternal miRNAs that are differentially expressed due to predation experience. These injected embryos are being measured for the same phenotypic traits as the F1 and F2 generation above to determine if the effects of parents' experience on offspring and their grandchildren are mediated by miRNAs, and to what extent (if any) other mechanisms underlie these changes. This fellowship provides valuable training in behavioral genomics for the fellow and an opportunity to participate in existing diversity programs in the broader University of Illinois community, including participation in mentoring LGBTQ students in STEM and elementary school girls in local science clubs."

Current evidence in the bioeducation literature indicates that student engagement in CUREs results in significant gains in their development of scientific reasoning skills, attitudes, and persistence in the domain. Authentic research experiences have likewise been shown to positively influence students' interest in scientific inquiry and their ability to ""think like a scientist."" While the above corpus of research has focused extensively on student outcomes within CUREs, more recent efforts have articulated the need to examine the extent to which contextual features and affordances within such learning environments mediate students' academic and professional development. Among these factors, the ability to conduct research in an ethical and responsible manner is argued to be of critical value, as it is one of the hallmarks of rigorous scientific investigation. Although the need to engender ethical and responsible research practices in students is therefore apparent, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the integration of ethics/RCR education within CURE contexts, despite its broader importance to professionalism within the scientific community. Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent existent ethics/RCR frameworks are amenable to CURE instruction. <br/><br/>The proposed initiative seeks to address these concerns through the formation of a consortium and structured activities that will foster sustainable relationships between individuals from diverse organizations, including minority-serving institutions, two-year colleges, research universities, and professional societies, who will be tasked with the exploration of ethics and responsible conduct of research within CUREs in the biological sciences. Specifically, network activities and products will: a) define and describe the current state of ethics/RCR education within bioscience CUREs; b) detail the perceptions of postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and administrators responsible for teaching and scholarship in the areas of CURE implementation and bioethics in regard to the long-term role of ethics/RCR in research-driven courses; and c) enhance both participants' and the publics' knowledge of ethics education in the context of authentic, research-based coursework through the dissemination of a public consortium website, presentations, and publications.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)."

One mechanism to accomplish these changes is the incorporation of course-based undergraduate research experiences. While isolated groups are introducing cell culture techniques into such experiences, there has been no coordinated effort to compile resources and provide training that makes creating customizable cell-culture-based research projects easier to implement at smaller, primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges where faculty time and resources are limited. The Cell Biology Education Coalition (CBEC) will address these major shortfalls through the creation of a network of faculty, students, and resources that will provide an infrastructure to facilitate the development and implementation of unique student-driven research experiences. By creating projects that align with a curriculum's learning goals and desired student outcomes, these activities will help strengthen critical thinking skills in and beyond the classroom.<br/><br/>The primary activity of CBEC will be the development of ""Cell Blocks,"" modules consisting of written and video protocols and classroom implementation strategies and assessments. Cell Blocks will be developed by faculty and their students at small institutions making it likely that they will be adaptable at similar schools. Because the Cell Blocks will have similar basic components, they will be able to be mixed and matched to answer novel questions. The implementation of multiple Cell Blocks will serve as the basis for semester-long research projects that provide the foundation for independent student research projects. Network faculty will have opportunities for professional development through the creation of new Cell Blocks, access to all Cell Block modules and associated supplies, and networking opportunities. Students will be able to interact within a community of scientists to expand on their experiences and create their own independent research projects, establish a funding record through a voucher system, and participate in professional development experiences. Such activities have the potential to increase the number of students entering STEM research fields at the graduate level and in the workforce. Additionally, because efforts will be made to recruit faculty from minority-serving institutions, the proposed network will have a pronounced effect on undergraduates underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/> This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).

The instrument will employ Multifocus Structured Illumination Microscopy, a transformative new imaging technique. The project team will construct and employ this powerful 3D  super-resolution imaging system in the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Life Sciences Microscopy Center in collaboration with biology research groups with an initial focus on studying chromatin dynamics. Our DNA genomes are stored in the nucleus of cells as a protein-DNA complex known as chromatin.  The basic repeating subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome, consists of a protein core with DNA wrapped twice around its outside, like thread around a spool. Our DNA genomes are organized into millions of regularly spaced nucleosomes which allow our DNA to be stored compactly and create new opportunities for regulation of gene expression.<br/><br/>Multifocus Structured Illumination Microscopy is designed to enable 3D imaging of chromatin in living cells at nearly physiological conditions with super-resolution capability. Using specially designed diffractive optical components, which will be custom made by the project team in one of the University of California academic nanofabrication user facilities, the microscope will simultaneously capture, on a single camera, an entire 3D volume of the biological specimen, by multiplexing and focus shifting the beam of light exiting the microscope objective. Employing fast Structured Illumination super-resolution imaging, the microscope will furthermore provide improved contrast and resolution to allow visualization of structures smaller than 200 nm, which have classically been impossible to study in living specimens. Placement of this instrument in the UCSC Life Sciences Microscopy Center ensures direct availability of new and exciting optical technology for application in biological research. The microscope will open up new fields of research, initially in chromatin dynamics, and successively also in other fields of biological research, where live 3D imaging beyond the classical limit of resolution is needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By testing and improving the design steps it will also allow researchers and engineers to produce proteins that have functions more complex than could be made before: these new activities have enormous potential to advance basic research and biotechnology. Proteins perform a vast array of complex and important functions in cells and in technology settings: they can speed up the rate of chemical reactions by several hundred fold, they are responsible for how cells communicate, and they are the basic material for building cell structures and tissues. The advantages to designing proteins instead of using those already known include being able to modify what by-products are made so that there is less damage to the environment, make low-toxicity sensors that can probe the action of living cells in real time, and create unique materials that form defined structures at the nanoscale. To ensure the methods are widely available, all approved computational methods will be available as source code via the Rosetta software suite. This software is free of charge for academic users, and is commonly licensed by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The new methods developed under this grant will also be used in classrooms for team-based projects and for interdisciplinary research activities that emphasize collaboration between students in the biological and physical/engineering sciences.<br/><br/>This research aims to address a principal barrier in computational protein design: the lack of computational approaches that predict both sequence and structural changes with sufficient accuracy. Design methods change the protein sequence but in the vast majority of cases allow only minimal structural adjustments. Yet conformational changes not captured by current methods are the rule rather than the exception, and a main reason for failed designs. Moreover, new conformations might be required to engineer new functions, e.g. to reshape an existing functional site to accommodate a different binding partner. Finally, many proteins undergo functional conformational changes, such as molecular switches or enzymes and protein machines that cycle between conformational states; such complex activities are currently not designable. Aim 1 seeks to advance methods to model changes in protein structure, and address challenges in both generating relevant protein conformations and distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions; established and new benchmarks will be used to assess limitations and quantify improvements. Aim 2 will develop an approach to design new functions that require substantial changes in protein conformation. The approach will be tested by experimental forward-engineering applications. Aim 3 will provide ""protocol capture"" documentation for tested methods and utilize developed methods in educational and research activities that seek to broaden participation. Validated methods will be available as source code via<br/>https://www.rosettacommons.org."

However, current technology has technical limitations that restrict what experiments are possible. Therefore, this project will create new technology through a NeuroNex neurotechnology hub, called Nemonic (NExt generation Multiphoton NeuroImaging Consortium). The Nemonic project has three parts. First, the development component will create new systems in a series of Case Studies to enable currently impossible neuroscience experiments. Second, the dissemination component will spread this technology broadly to other neuroscience labs through open source resources, workshops, and industry partnerships. Third, the advancement component will push the fundamental technology of multiphoton neuroimaging into the next frontier. Two specific technologies will be developed: miniaturized photonic systems for multiphoton neuroimaging; and super-resolution imaging to image submicron structures. Also, a series of meetings will foster novel collaborations to more rapidly advance engineering technologies that are relevant to multiphoton neuroimaging in the future. Technology developed in the Nemonic project will also be relevant to manufacturing, 3D printing, and photonics. This work will also increase partnerships between academia and industry, enhance STEM training, and recruit and support the scientific training and careers of women and URM scientists.<br/><br/>The Case Studies will develop new instrumentation for large field-of-view two- photon and three-photon imaging, scalable temporal multiplexing, and integrated behavior. This technology will be developed for compatibility with an array of model systems. The focus will be on calcium and glutamate imaging, in cell bodies and processes, and other fluorescent indicators can be employed. The workshops will cover optical design, fabrication, assembly, and use, for an audience of neuroscientists and engineers. One advancement project will develop high peak power ultrafast lasers with transform limited pulses, with integrated, beam conditioning, beam steering, focusing, and detection systems. The other advancement project will develop super-resolution multiphoton imaging using spatial frequency modulation, adaptive optics, and novel pulse conditioning. Together, this work will advance multiphoton neuroimaging and a suite of related technology, through research, enhanced training, and industry partnerships.

The Multimodal Integrated Neural Technologies (MINT) hub aims to develop and provide tools that are able to read from and modulate neurons at multiple sites independently at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The hub will disseminate tools and methods to correlate the recorded cell activity with the structural connection. In this way, the connectivity of active cells can be visualized, labeled, and traced for detailed functional mapping. The mission of the MINT hub is to provide a collection of tools, synergistically developed, integrated, and available to the neuroscience community, to address one theme: connecting neurophysiology and structural analysis with a greater scale and resolution. The synergistic integration of these neurotechnology tools at the MINT Hub would accelerate the rate of discovery in neuroscience. This in turn can be expected to pave the way to improved treatments for neurological disorders and to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, especially neuromorphic computing. The MINT hub will provide annual training workshops for new users to be familiar with new technologies and able to use them effectively. To achieve sustainability, the hardware tools will be actively marketed to the community and those with sustainable volume will be transitioned to commercialization partners. Importantly, this program will cross-train neuroscience and technology personnel during the course of this program, resulting in preparation of a new generation of multi-disciplinary engineers and scientists.<br/><br/>This hub uniquely combines high-density electrodes, chemical sensing, optical stimulation, and cell labeling. Fiberless high-density optoelectrodes can allow optical stimulation of individual or few neurons with high specificity and selectivity using monolithically integrated micro-LEDs or optical waveguides on multi-shank silicon probes. Carbon microthreads will be used to create advanced arrays that will dramatically increase the ability to record from interconnected neurons and label those cells with high accuracy. Advanced metal alloys will also be used to greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of miniaturized electrodes. The MINT hub will innovate viral vector delivery and tissue clearing in the nervous system and combine these with multispectral labeling for intact cell phenotyping. Furthermore, an open-source software will be developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anatomical reconstruction for creating connectivity maps. The MINT hub will validate the developed tools and methods in three in-vivo experiments to exemplify what can be accomplished when the proposed modalities and methods are synergistically integrated.

It provides researchers with unique capabilities of imaging, measuring, and manipulating single live cells and sub-cellular biological specimen on the same platform, with nanoscale spatial and force resolutions. The proposed research aims to develop a scanning probe microscope that overcomes limitations of commercially available devices that have ""stiff"" probes which are detrimental to creating 3D images of live biological specimens. The research outcomes of this IDBR award will be disseminated to the scientific community through (1) patent disclosure and licenses, (2) close collaboration with leading SPM companies, and (3) presentations in major cell biology, experimental biology, and biophysics conferences. The educational activities of the project include (1) Fostering multidisciplinary training by developing research based content for the curriculum in biology and engineering courses, (2) Recruitment and retention of under-represented students at the graduate and undergarduate level in the fields of biology and engineering, and (3) Outreach activities for middle- and high- school girls through open lab tours by leveraging the well-established programs at Rutgers (Rutgers Society for Women Engineers).<br/><br/>Silicon-based cantilever probes universally used on all commercially available are too stiff and harsh to avoid deforming/damaging live biological surfaces (e.g., cell membrane), particularly for mammalian cells of large volume and soft and corrugated membrane. Moreover, both the contact-mode imaging protocol, currently the most effective mode for imaging single live cells in liquid, and the nanomechanical measurement protocol of open-loop nature, are not only prone to liquid-related disturbances and damage to the cell membrane, but also rather slow and narrow banded in imaging and measuring the nanomechanical properties of live cells. The project aims to overcome these limits through the development and integration of soft polymer-based cantilever probes, an adaptive imaging protocol of minimal deformation, and a control-based nanomechanical measurement protocol. The polymer-based cantilever will be designed and fabricated with contact stiffness and other mechanical properties tailored to SPM imaging and force interaction on mammalian cells. The imaging protocol of minimal-deformation will be developed based on an accurate quantification of the scanning-induced membrane deformation in real-time, to adaptively adjust both the scanning speed and the normal force to minimize membrane deformation and maximize the overall imaging efficacy. Then the control-based nanomechanical protocol is developed to completely remove the cantilever acceleration effect and substantially reduce the hydrodynamic force effect on the indentation measurement of live cells. The developed instrument will be evaluated and for its ability to quantify the viscoelasticity oscillation of cytoskeleton in real-time, and to quantify and correlate the morphological and mechanical evolutions of live cells during the cell division process."

In this project, we will use CMOS IC technology to create a new type of instrument capable of high spatial- and temporal-resolution electrochemical imaging of planar multicellular structures that are placed in contact with the chip. In particular, we will study (1) phenazines, a class of redox-active antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, which vary in structure and chemical properties and have individualized, drastic effects on community morphogenesis; and (2) nitric oxide (NO), an intermediate in P. aeruginosa denitrification, a metabolic process that also affects colony morphogenesis when nitrate is made available in the environment. NO has been implicated in multicellular behavior and development in diverse organisms.<br/><br/>This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program, Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (Engineeing Directorate)."

The study of Blue Ridge escarpment watersheds and aquatic ecology and biota has long been an important research activity at HBS because of the Station's proximity to the headwaters of several major river systems of upland North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. These river systems have both Atlantic and Gulf drainage and support some of the richest aquatic diversity in North America. The HBS Aquatics Laboratory was built in the late 1950s and has served the scientific community well for over 5 decades, supporting numerous scientific studies and specialized aquatics courses for teaching and training undergraduates, graduate students, and Federal and State agency biologists nationwide. This project aims to modernize and expand this now-dated laboratory at a time when Blue Ridge Escarpment watersheds are experiencing accelerated changes, from development to precipitation patterns to dam removal, activities that affect or are projected to alter forest hydrology and stream and river health in complex ways. The wettest region in the eastern continental US, the southern mountain region and its aquatic resources are a natural laboratory and classroom, and an ideal setting for learning about how watersheds and river systems function ecologically and respond to environmental changes. <br/><br/>This project aims to reconfigure, update, and expand the HBS Aquatics Laboratory by (1) modernizing the lab infrastructure by upgrading outdated electrical, lighting, HVAC, insulation, and plumbing; (2) rearranging and replumbing existing research tanks and artificial streams; (3) expanding the research lab to provide bench space, restroom, and accommodate upgraded research equipment; and (4) reorganizing and upgrading the adjacent exterior space by replumbing outdoor artificial streams and creating storage for field equipment. The upgraded HBS Aquatics Laboratory will support a greater breadth of controlled laboratory and field studies of regional riverine and stream system ecology, improving the scientific understanding of these systems and thus providing the information needed to inform planning, management, and mitigation. Expansion of the facility is also designed to dovetail with the growing public education and enrichment activities at HBS, introducing K-12 students and life-long learners to the equipment and methodologies of aquatic sciences."

Applications of PTN will include high-resolution imaging of molecules in live cells as well as investigating protein misfolding, degradation, and aggregation. PTN can provide control and optimization of biological applications of lasers such as tissue dissection and ablation. PTN would be a valuable alternative or supplement to existing microscopic techniques and, in combination with them, could provide a powerful and versatile tool for biological research with a focus on cells. The project will benefit variety of biological research communities and scientific areas including cell biology, proteomics, neuroscience, nanotechnology, plasmonic nanosensing, gerontology, and cancer therapy. This interdisciplinary research involving physicists, biologists, and computer engineers includes a training program on advanced optical imaging that will train and educate undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project has the following goals: 1) develop a photothermal confocal nanosocopy platform with enhanced sensitivity; 2) explore nonlinear and photoswitching phenomena to improve both spatial and spectral resolution; and 3) explore the unique applications of PTN including label-free and targeted imaging of different nanostructures, protein aggregates and image-guided disaggregation. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the new concept of a far-field microscopy integrating a confocal design, high pulse-rate lasers, high-speed scanning, and time-resolved detection, to significantly improve on current diffraction and spectral limitations. Because many cellular components in the native state have low fluorescence, and are nano-scale in size, there is a clear need for an imaging technique to study them with high resolution, high absorption sensitivity, temporal resolution and fast acquisition time. The proposed PTN will provide unprecedented resolution with enhanced absorption sensitivity, thus opening new windows into unexplored areas of biological research associated with cell metabolic activity, oxidization, endocytosis, phagocytosis, melanogenesis, and apoptosis."

Participating in the workshop will be faculty and teachers from schools in the US Pacific Island territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Compact-of-Free-Association countries (CoFA).<br/><br/>This workshop follows the recommendations from a prior workshop, held in 2016, that discussed various barriers that prevent NHPI students from pursuing a STEM career. One of the main issues that surfaced at that workshop was the presence of strong cultural practices that could be seen as a barrier for young students to pursue a STEM career. Currently, there is an imminent risk presented by rising sea levels that have resulted in threats to homes, agriculture and continued residence in some of the islands. Therefore, there is a strong desire to grow native NH and PI talent who have the expertise to address the threats. <br/><br/>The workshop will result in active discussions of the issues facing NHPI, and the creation of plans to address the barriers to STEM participation. It is anticipated that when changes in the curricula and academic structure of some of the island schools are made, more students would be inclined to pursue STEM degrees. An outcome of this workshop will include a written document/report that will be made publicly available. <br/><br/>Increasing the number Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders in STEM fields will allow this group to actively engage in devising solutions to the many problems faced by the islanders due to changing climate. The proposed workshop will provide a group of faculty and staff at schools and colleges across the Pacific with potential solutions to be able to attract more talent into STEM.

While the approaches for making these improvements are well-known, their application on campuses is still not wide-spread. To facilitate implementation of these improvements, campus leaders play critical roles. In particular, those leaders with decision-making authority over budget, personnel and policy (e.g., deans) can either be gatekeepers or gateways to promoting the success of these efforts. A recent review makes the case for the need to develop shared leadership models in higher education to more effectively solve the increasingly complex problems facing colleges and universities. However, there is no clear definition of the skills required to lead using this type of model, nor are there manuals, workshops or other resources to help leaders develop these competencies. <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will bring together positional leaders to reflect on both their experience and the current leadership development literature to define the set of distinctive competencies required to lead scalable, sustainable systemic institutional change. These competencies will be defined and then used as the basis for building resources that will be geared toward developing these competencies in positional leaders across the country. The set of competencies will be published in a summary article and used to create a plan for the development of leadership program resources. Participants will also contribute to the development of resources that can be made widely available for higher education leadership programs offered through higher education associations and other organizations. This will develop leaders who can more effectively implement, scale and sustain institutional change efforts geared towards improving undergraduate Biology student access, persistence and graduation of underrepresented minority students. This work may also lead to additional workshops to develop corresponding competencies for faculty, staff and students who are participants in campus change projects. Finally, this work will contribute to the development of new research questions regarding how well leaders who have been exposed to the new resources exhibit the competencies and use them to more effectively lead campus change efforts.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. In doing so, the proposed research will highlight the importance of natural history collections in broadening our understanding of how biodiversity arises relative to ecological variables such as habitat and to symbiotic associations with microbes, upon which all animals depend. Specifically, this study investigates the role of habitat use and a symbiosis with luminous bacteria on the diversification of a group of bioluminescent coral reef fish. The methods that will be developed to extract both host and symbiont DNA from museum specimens will establish new opportunities to understand the way in which host animals and their bacterial symbionts change over time relative to each other and to their environments. Such information is especially valuable at this critical time when rapidly changing environments threaten to de-couple essential symbiotic associations. The historical patterns of species' dependencies on particular habitats and their abilities to adapt to new conditions, along with their symbionts, can be used to predict their future responses to impending environmental changes.<br/><br/>This project examines the symbiotically luminous genus of coral reef fish Siphamia (Perciformes: Apogonidae) as a model with which to investigate both habitat use and its symbiosis with luminous bacteria as drivers of speciation in the host. By applying next generation sequencing methods to archived museum specimens, the specific research objectives are (i) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Siphamia fishes, (ii) to compare the defined divergence patterns in Siphamia relative to species-habitat use and biogeographic distributions, (iii) to identify the luminous symbionts of various Siphamia hosts species, and (iv) to compare symbiont genotypes and phylogenic relationships with both host divergence patterns and environmental characteristics such as depth and temperature. To carry out these objectives, the fellow will extract DNA from the tissue of all 23 described Siphamia species archived in museum collections from sites representative of their geographic ranges and will apply restriction site associated sequencing (RAD-Seq) methods to resolve the phylogeny of the host fish. The fellow will also extract the DNA of the luminous symbionts from Siphamia light organs, including those from modern specimens collected during this project, and will sequence genes known to vary between luminous bacteria in the Vibrionaceae family to infer a phylogeny of the light organ symbionts. The divergence patterns in the host fish will then be compared to their habitat use, distributions, and patterns of symbiont diversification to test for signatures of ecological speciation driven by these factors, revealing the underlying ecological processes that might have shaped the diversification of this coral reef fish and its bioluminescent symbiosis. This research will be based at the California Academy of Sciences (CAS) and will foster public engagement on the underlying themes of microbial symbioses and of species-adaptive responses to their environment through outreach programs and exhibits designed to highlight the importance of biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems and its current threats. Other important aspects of this project include the incorporation of new specimens in the ichthyology, microbiology, and frozen DNA collections at CAS for use in future research as well as the training of undergraduate students on the applied molecular methods."

Understanding why some animal traits evolve more rapidly than others is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. Reproductive traits are often among the fastest changing traits, but despite longstanding ideas about what drives their evolution, biologists still lack direct evidence of how these traits evolve in vertebrate animals such as mammals. The fellow will investigate how competition among males may drive changes in reproductive traits. First, the fellow will use lines of experimentally evolved house mice, in which changes in male reproductive traits have been documented, to determine whether male and female reproductive traits have evolved together. Second, the fellow will use recently developed methods to determine how fast these traits have evolved among species within a group of Australian rodents, and whether these changes have been driven by competition among males. This work will provide some of the first direct evidence about what drives the evolution of male and female reproductive phenotypes in mammals. It will also contribute to the toolkit available to scientists by establishing new methods for the study of evolution using museum collections. Finally, it will result in new international collaborations between scientists in the US and Australia, while training a new post-doctoral researcher in cutting edge methods.<br/><br/> The fellow will investigate the hypothesis that the mammalian baculum has evolved via selection driven by male-male competition. First, the fellow will use experimentally evolved, wild-derived house mice to empirically determine whether and how female reproductive morphology co-varies with baculum shape. Second, using phylogenetic comparative methods and specimens from 63 species of muroid rodents, the fellow will determine the diversification rate of bacula and female reproductive tracts across a molecular phylogeny. Finally, the fellow will quantify the relative importance of male-male competition across Australian muroid rodents and determine its role in the evolutionary diversification of reproductive morphology. The proposed fellowship activities will significantly expand the fellow's range of research expertise with respect to both ideas and concrete skillsets, enabling a more integrative approach to the study of evolution and animal behavior in her academic career.

While there is strong support for neuroscience education within this large and diverse community, the adoption of case studies and PBL methods within neuroscience courses is far less developed. Finding appropriate teaching resources, in part due to the interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience and the rapid growth of neuroscience programs, is a strong challenge. This network will provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience education community. The increased faculty and future faculty collaboration on creating case studies stimulated by the network promises to enhance neuroscience education in all institutional contexts.<br/><br/>The broad objectives of this network are twofold: to provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and to create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience community. The network is organized into cohorts of case writers, each with 6-8 Fellows of whom are experienced in cases/PBL methodologies. These Fellows will work collaboratively to create publishable case studies via focused workshops. The Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education will be a primary vehicle for dissemination of these pedagogical tools to the wider neuroscience education community. The network then provides support for Fellows to create their own peer-mentoring groups which is intended to both support the generation of a new rounds of case writers but more importantly to encourage and promote implementation of case studies and PBL in the classroom. The network will partner with established promotors of neuroscience education, specifically the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience and the Society for Neuroscience to education and inform the community of these new curricular tools. Thus, with the creation of new curricular materials via the case writing Fellows and peer mentoring groups to encourage and support the implementation of these case studies, the network will have a strong impact in promoting pedagogical change in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

UAM is home to one of the largest research collections of frozen animal and plant tissues in the world.  In addition to its global scope, it features unparalleled holdings of arctic and subarctic material from a region undergoing profound environmental change and rapidly increasing human encroachment.  Notable holdings include the largest and fastest-growing collection of marine mammal tissues in the world; samples from migratory birds that come from six continents to breed in Alaska each year; and permafrost-preserved tissues from extinct Pleistocene organisms.  The conversion to a liquid nitrogen system will secure an incalculably valuable scientific resource for ongoing and future research and education efforts.  Nearly all frozen tissues are associated with voucher specimens, adding to their information content and allowing for research on countless aspects of organismal biology beyond genetics and genomics.  For example, samples from the UAM-GR are routinely used by scientists globally to investigate questions in evolution, ecology, toxicology, biomedicine, and numerous other fields.  The project will also train students in modern cryopreservation technology and collection management and outlines plans to leverage ongoing outreach of the UAM to highlight the research, education and wider societal benefits of the collection.<br/><br/>This project is funded to facilitate the purchase and installation of four Liquid Nitrogen cryovats and associated racks to replace failing mechanical freezers.  Additionally, a liquid nitrogen plant of sufficient production capacity to maintain eight cryovats will be maintained. The resulting configuration represents a 68% increase in space efficiency and will accommodate all samples currently housed in failing mechanical freezers as well as an anticipated 20 years of continued growth.  The transition to a cryopreservation system entirely based on liquid nitrogen will enhance specimen security and significantly reduce energy consumption.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge cryopreservation methods and collections-based research in the biological sciences.  Outreach at UAM-GR will continue to target visitors of all ages including K-16 students, researchers, politicians, and the public.  These efforts will be augmented through the production of podcasts and videos targeting native Alaskans, a group that is significantly underrepresented in the STEM disciplines."

This network is building on an RCN-UBE incubator project that surveyed instructors of introductory biology laboratories to help define the important elements of authentic research experiences and identify barriers to implementing authentic research experiences. <br/><br/>The network team will use a series of workshop meetings to bridge the divide between the biology education community and disciplinary researchers in biology. By bridging this divide, new models for authentic research in introductory laboratory courses will be developed and new faculty will become engaged in implementing these experiences. In each year, one workshop will be hosted in association with an annual meeting of the biology education community (e.g., either Association for Biology Laboratory Education [ABLE], Council on Undergraduate Research [CUR], National Association of Biology Teachers [NABT], or Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students [ABRCMS]) and disciplinary researchers in biology will be actively recruited to attend. A second workshop will be hosted in association with a biology disciplinary society and members of the biology education community will be actively recruited to attend. Finally, to advance the field of biology education research in relation to authentic research experiences in laboratory courses, a meeting among disciplinary biology researchers, biology education researchers, and biology education practitioners will be held in association with the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/."

This instrument, which facilitates detailed analysis of cellular metabolic rates, will support research in animal physiology, virology, genetics, and neurotransmitter biology. A diverse group of researchers across two primarily undergraduate institutions (PUI) are eager to incorporate the Seahorse XF analyzer within their classes and research programs. The requested instruments will play a central role in collaborative faculty-student research in biology and neuroscience at Colgate University and Hamilton College, and will facilitate current and future excellence in undergraduate research training in the sciences. In addition, the requested Seahorse instruments will have a significant impact on instructional laboratories across the curriculum in areas that include neuroscience, animal physiology, and microbiology. Between undergraduate research training and utilization in courses, this system will impact approximately 150 undergraduates a year. The projects will facilitate research with potential societal benefits in the fields of aging, viral infection, and cancer, and will provide outreach opportunities for high school students interested in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The Seahorse XFe96 oxygen flux analyzer is a multimodal system capable measuring cellular metabolic parameters including glycolysis rate and mitochondrial stress. In addition to its use in classroom laboratory settings, this unique technology will be deployed in student-focused research laboratories to investigate the following research questions: (1) How do cellular metabolic rates change with body size and age of dogs and how are they linked to whole-animal metabolism? Differences in longevity demonstrate that small dogs have significantly longer lifespans that larger breed dogs. Thus, dogs constitute an informative group to study connections between life-history and physiology. We can only use Seahorse technology to untangle this basic biological rule due to the nature of working with primary fibroblast cells from young and old dogs. (2) How do reoviruses alter cellular metabolic pathways when used as oncolytic agents? Reoviruses are non-pathogenic mammalian viruses. However, very little is known about how reovirus replication alters a host cell's metabolic state, another basic biological principle that can only be elucidated with the use of a Seahorse XFe96 because metabolic alterations due to viral infections can only be measured using intact cells. (3) Does the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) protect against cellular damage due to malfunctioning mitochondria, and KLF4 is a mediator of cell cycle regulation and development? However, the role of Klf4 in regulating cellular metabolic pathways remains to be elucidated. Seahorse XF technology is the only method to measure mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis (as an alternative pathway). (4) How does the whole-animal cellular phenotype of intact C. elegans change when exposed to the estrogen-like molecule DES, which decreases fertility in animals? The Seahorse XF technology is perfect to determine the effects of DES on cellular metabolism over multiple generations. (5) What effect does ascorbic acid (AA) have on the growth and development of larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta? Larvae reared on AA-deficient diets grow less and develop more slowly relative to larvae fed a normal AA-containing diet. The mechanisms of AA-dependent growth in insects remain unclear and the seahorse technology will allow us to directly examine the metabolic underpinnings of this AA-dependent process. Together, these projects will significantly enhance student-faculty research at Colgate University and Hamilton College."

The microscope measures all four properties of light interacting with cell and tissue: intensity, wavelength, polarization, and phase.  The ability to instantaneously measure live cells and follow motions and processes over time provides valuable information to the study of cellular dynamics, motility, and cell and tissue morphology. This project will bring multidisciplinary research and education in optical sciences and biology to both undergraduates and graduates students through the research in microfabrication, optical instrumentation, and bioimaging.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to integrate quantitative polarization and phase imaging techniques for label-free imaging of live cell dynamics.

The sensor will be integrated with a microscope that can simultaneously capture 3 phase-shift images for quantitative phase measurement or 4 images with different polarization states for quantitative polarization measurement. The fast acquisition capacity of polarization and phase imaging will allow the coupling of spectral, phase, and polarization analysis and may reveal previously unattained vital information about the dynamics in living cells, tissues, and whole organisms, leading to new discoveries not possible before. The polarization and phase imaging techniques being developed for this project also enable new applications and experiments in cancer detection, diseases diagnosis and surgery."

New small and light-weight microscopes have been developed that can be carried on the heads of laboratory mice and rats. These microscopes take advantage of new probes that sense calcium levels and flash bright when a brain cell becomes active. The Neuronex Neurotechnology Hub has built new miniature microscopes that not only sense light but can also directly record the electrical activity of the large numbers of cells deep in the brain. This combination of electrical and optical recordings gives scientists the new ability to read out how large groups of brain cells and brain regions work together as the brain senses, learns, plans and executes actions. The Neuronex Neurotechnology Hub will also create new computer systems that can analyze these activity patterns extremely quickly (within small fractions of a second). This rapid feedback system will allow investigators to rapidly probe how the activity of specific groups of brain cells is linked to each behavior. Finally, the Hub will build and test a new miniature microscope called a ""light field miniature microscope"".  This version of the microscope will allow investigators to make 3-D movies of brain activity, greatly improving their view of the large network of brain cells. All these technologies will be openly shared with neuroscience community through a website (miniscope.org), such that each laboratory can build each of these devices themselves at very low cost. The Hub will hold workshops to teach scientists how to build and use the various devices. Finally the hub will reach out to the broader community by holding classes for K-12 and college students, and demonstrating how these devices can give us a view of brain function.<br/><br/>This Neurotechnology Hub will develop and share next-generation miniaturized in vivo sensing devices that integrate optical and electrophysiological recording from hundreds or thousands of neurons in behaving animals. These devices will be coupled with energy-efficient computing hardware for real-time signal processing and closed-loop feedback capabilities. The Hub will also create light field miniaturized microscopes that will allow three dimensional optical recordings of network activity in freely behaving animals. Last, the Hub will manufacture and distribute custom made, 3 dimensional silicon microprobes for large scale electrophysiological recordings. Making these devices widely available for neuroscience research and teaching will have significant broader impacts, by accelerating discovery and broadening outreach.  The  devices and techniques will be distributed widely to a large community of researchers, as previously done with the open-source miniaturized microscope developed by the PIs (the website at miniscope.org already has >2500 registered users and >250 labs using our microscope), as well as with silicon microprobes (>100 devices have been shared with users). Hence, the Hub will have a broad impact upon neuroscience research, facilitating many future advances in our understanding of the neural basis for emotion, cognition, and behavior, with a high potential to catalyze major new discoveries. The PIs will establish an outreach program through partnership with the Minority Access to Research Careers program at UCLA, as well as the UCLA Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED), to involve highly diversified high school and undergraduate students in this research. This NeuroTechnology Hub award is funded by the Division of Emerging Frontiers within the Directorate for Biological Sciences as part of the BRAIN Initiative and NSF's Understanding the Brain activities."

The fellow, Kevin Marquez Johnson, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Dr. Morgan Kelly at Louisiana State University. The project is focused on learning how oysters from different regions in the Gulf of Mexico respond to variations in temperature and salinity. This work is important because changes in land-use and rainfall can dramatically influence salinity and temperature in the Gulf. By investigating how present-day populations respond to changes in temperature and salinity, this research will provide a valuable resource to conservation biologists, state managers, and small-scale farmers as they maintain over 2 million acres of public and private oyster grounds that produced 14.5 million pounds of oysters in 2015. <br/><br/>This research explores adaptations to local environmental conditions at three oyster reefs located along a natural salinity gradient in the Gulf of Mexico. Evidence for adaptation to salinity and temperature is being assessed by measuring three indicators of individual oyster health: (i) food ingestion rate, (ii) growth rate, and (iii) the heritability of environmentally-induced epigenetic modifications. Utilizing classic metrics for oyster health (i.e. ingestion and growth rates) across multiple generations will provide the necessary tools to determine if oysters from these three reefs are locally adapted to their native environment. This research also uses epigenomic sequencing to track DNA methylation patterns from the parent population (F0) to the second generation (F2). Tracking these environmentally inducible epigenomic changes across multiple generations is providing valuable insight into the heritability of these markers and quantifying the variation of these markers in natural populations. Finally, this work is broadening<br/>participation of under-represented groups in biology at both Louisiana State University (LSU) and local high schools.

Lemurs are unique to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, and due to their critically-endangered status, are not a renewable resource.  The DLC is an exceptional training ground for students across all ages and academic levels.  Over its 50-year history, thousands of students ranging from K-12 through postgraduate levels have been engaged in and inspired by their experiences at the DLC.  Also, hundreds of thousands of visitors from the general public have been exposed to the concepts of biodiversity discovery and conservation, as well as the power of biological research via their exposure to the DLC's staff, students, and collections.  The DLC serves as a living laboratory for advancing interdisciplinary research, scholarship, and biological conservation, covering biological disciplines ranging from behavioral ecology to brain sciences, evolutionary ecology, microbial metagenomics, comparative genomics, biomechanics, One Health disease dynamics, aging and demography, biodiversity conservation, paleontology, climate change, comparative physiology, speciation genetics, sensory biology, and more.  <br/><br/>The award will help the DLC meet its short and long-term goals, which include improving support for undergraduate research projects, engaging in exchanges and loan agreements to maintain and enhance species and genetic diversity, and harnessing new technologies to improve comparative biological research involving lemurs.  The research and colony-care programs that will be supported by this project have oversight from a dedicated team of professionals who collectively represent five PhDs, three Masters degrees, two DVMs, and additively, more than two hundred years of direct experience with lemur research, health, husbandry, conservation, and captive management.  The DLC is the only place in the world where lemurs are readily available to investigators, and where biological samples, decades of medical records, fossil representatives of extinct taxa, and rich life-history are available for comparative studies.  Access to colony inventories, demographics, metadata and research opportunities is available on-line (lemur.duke.edu).  The DLC serves multiple educational communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students.  For K-12 students, activities include summer camps and a variety of classroom learning and interactive activities with increasing engagement in long-distance learning through on-line tools for educational outreach.  The veterinary department also supports educational activities via undergraduate work-study opportunities and veterinary student training.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Genomics is transforming health, nature, and society in the 21st century, as new technologies make genomic data available, accessible, and useful to an increasingly wide range of stakeholders. To reap the transformative benefits of genomics, however, better integration between what genomic technologies are feasible and what genomic technologies are useful is necessary. Convergent genomics adapts to the changing relationship between the development of ideas and technology and the individuals, groups and institutions that are affected by these innovations. The convergent model integrates recognized leaders from engineering, natural, and social sciences with experience in technology development, genome analytics, and the integration of science and social impact analysis. This planning grant will capture interdisciplinary expertise in a manner that maximizes the power of convergent genomics--that is, a genomics in which engineers work alongside natural and social scientists, formulating the foci of work and the novel forms of engagement needed to realize them. Through a series of three workshops focused on identifying research themes, stakeholders, and organizing principles, the problems facing the growing genomics community and the specific tools and resources needed for convergent genomics will be developed. <br/><br/>Genomics, due to the speed of technological innovation, volume of data produced, and expertise required to generate and interpret these data, is at high risk of evolving through narrowly focused research communities that are heavily siloed and not motivated to serve the best interests of society. The UCSC Genomics Institute has the unique combination of expertise in device and instrument development, genome analytics, and social sciences to be a global leader in engineering technologies that are designed to maximize both technological power and social impact. Through a series of three planning meetings and with the help of a facilitator, we will develop a proposal for an Engineering Research Center (ERC) with activities that will revolve around four pillars of genomics innovation: Integrated device and instrument technology; data science; training the next genomic engineering work force; and establishing and protecting the innovation ecosystem of the genomics field. These pillars, which represent the intellectual merit of our proposed ERC, require a convergent and holistic approach that far exceeds the scope of small-scale projects and small teams of investigators, thus achieving the broader impacts that are the promise of convergent genomic innovation. For instance, technologies that glean molecular information must do so from diverse biological samples efficiently and accurately and communicate results to a broad constituency of stakeholders. Devices and instruments are valuable to the public only if resulting data and information are accessible, equitable and open, and shared in a manner that is cognizant of the complex challenges of privacy and justice. Similarly, questions of storage of, access to, and ownership of genomic data and technologies present formidable challenges that will result in policies that affect everyone across society. Activities such as implementation of a cross-departmental undergraduate mentoring program and establishment of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in concert with other academic partner institutions will integrate trainees into this convergent environment. Open workshops, symposia, and outreach activities, which will be developed throughout the planning period, will engage the public and other stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>This grant will provide planning resources for a proposed Center for Edge Intelligence. The proposed center will develop new techniques for data science driven by Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. IoT systems interact with the real world: industry, health care, agriculture, etc. IoT systems promise substantial benefits for these and other application areas by gathering and processing data from the real world. However, new approaches are required to harness the potential of IoT systems. IoT devices must operate with limits on both electrical power and communication. These factors mean that key aspects of these intelligent systems must be embodied outside of large data centers, at the edge of the Internet, close to the points at which data are created and used. This planning grant has three goals.  The planning grant effort will identify a full center team including member institution researchers, diversity and inclusion coordinators, workforce development coordinators, and entrepreneurship coordinators. The proposing team will identify a broad set of stakeholders among researchers, industrial partners, entrepreneurs, and educators. The full center team and stakeholders will create a strategic plan for the Center for Edge Intelligence.<br/><br/>Edge Intelligence is the convergence of three fields: data science, low-power computing, and distributed systems. Data science and IoT systems are typically studied, developed, and deployed by very different groups. The Center for Edge Intelligence's mission will be to build a community of stakeholders across industry and academia to develop and harness the capabilities of this emerging technology. The intellectual approach of the Center will be based on several foundations: machine learning, statistics, low-power computing, distributed algorithms. Internet-of-Things systems are widely used in manufacturing, health care, logistics, agriculture, and many other areas. Machine learning applied to IoT systems can provide new levels of customization and improved system operation. The Center for Edge Intelligence will pursue a convergent, holistic research approach in foundations, engineering, and applications. Foundational goals include machine learning algorithms designed for distributed computing systems with limited bandwidth and power. Incremental learning algorithms to customize and update systems for their particular environment. Engineering goals include distributed systems that perform machine learning on distributed platforms, including edge nodes, fog hubs, and the cloud. Low-power machine learning systems. Low-power approaches to edge- and hub-based incremental training. Applications include manufacturing, health care and wellness, agriculture, transportation and logistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare - at home, in long-term care facilities, and in hospitals - is becoming ever more important for patients and the society at large. Although the two current trends in healthcare - telemedicine and digital medicine - are making headway, they only scratch the surface of the problem as opposed to dealing with the root cause. To revolutionize healthcare delivery, we need a comprehensive biophysical patient model, namely a ""digital twin"", that fuses data streams, doctor notes/assessments, and medical histories with a rigorous computational engine that can make probabilistic predictions of future patient health/well-being. Healthcare providers will then be able to integrate traditional knowledge/training with the ""data-to-decision"" posture of the digital twin, while working with the patient, to best assess their health, evaluate options, predict future health, and optimize patient outcomes and prognosis. The aim of this Planning Grant is to engage and converge a broad stakeholder community of engineers, data scientists, educators, artists, medical specialists, hospitals, consulting firms, digital health firms, and health and government agencies to openly discuss and identify the most urgent engineering research, education, and outreach gaps that need to be addressed for revolutionizing medical decision-making and personalized medicine. Once the ERC is established, the team will partner closely with stakeholders to identify current issues in medical care, design and build engineering solutions, and deploy these solutions in phases after careful assessment of their effectiveness. It is through these activities that truly personalized medicine will be achieved, where cyber-physical healthcare monitoring can be tailored to specific patients as they are identified early at risk versus when severe complications unfold. Furthermore, the education and outreach initiatives of the CYBER-MD ERC will actively recruit women, underrepresented, and economically disadvantaged individuals for research and training future generations of multidisciplinary, convergent scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Healthcare practice today only provides clinicians with limited amounts of historic patient data, and doctors tend to rely on outdated training and anecdotal experiences to best care for their patients. However, given the broad overlap in symptomatology across various diseases, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis remains a major problem. The vision of the CYBRE-MD ERC is to establish a cyber-physical innovation hub, where engineering breakthroughs in bio-physical modeling, imaging, sensing, data science, data visualization, and probabilistic risk assessment methodologies collectively revolutionize the medical diagnostic/treatment process for improving patient outcomes. The cornerstone of this concept is a ""digital twin"" that is born and then evolves with the patient while constantly being updated over time with new data streams ranging from biometrics to illness/injury assessments to diagnostic images/results to subsequent treatments. The digital twin not only presents a new data architecture for storing patient health informatics, but it also provides transformative health assessment and predictive analytic capabilities that enable doctors and patients to work together to improve patient health, well-being, and outcomes. CYBER-MD is inherently transdisciplinary and spans the entire spectrum of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) as well as all branches of medicine. This Planning Grant will convene diverse experts to converge on a final strategic implementation, define focused research grand challenges, identify relevant thematic areas, communicate with stakeholders, educate, devise innovative and broadly implementable education/outreach efforts, and assemble the most competent and diverse team that underpins this transdisciplinary NSF ERC. The activities planned directly support convergent research, which is of utmost necessity for tackling this overarching grand challenge that spans the fields of STEAM, medicine, healthcare, and public health/well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of these advancements, groups such as consumers/patients, clinicians, healthcare administrators, and public health officials must make decisions in increasingly data-rich environments. It is therefore essential that we present these data to decision-makers in understandable and actionable ways, via well-designed data visualizations tailored to varied end users. An ERC focused on health data visualization could help transform this vast and growing amount of health data into useful, actionable information. This ERC planning grant will provide a unique opportunity to bring together researchers and stakeholders from across the nation to systematically plan for an ERC that will improve healthcare decision-making - and therefore health outcome - by fundamentally changing the way health data visualizations are designed, developed, and implemented. The planning grant will also allow the research team to develop an ERC that will strengthen our engineering workforce by providing a diverse group of students with transdisciplinary mindsets, experiences, and skills to work in the rapidly growing health information technology and data science landscapes.<br/><br/>After conducting the planning grant activities, we will be positioned to submit a strategic ERC proposal with a clear and cohesive 10-year vision, driven by a large interdisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholders from academia, industry, and government. We will also have operational structures and procedures specified to facilitate long-term shared visioning, efficient and effective operations, professional development opportunities, high-value student training, and clear communication of center activities to diverse audiences. The planning grant will involve continuous asynchronous collaboration between the research team members, an in-person research team visioning workshop, and a 2-day facilitated workshop. The workshop will involve interdisciplinary researchers from the team members? institutions and members of the stakeholder community, including those from healthcare provider organizations, technology companies, insurance companies, and government agencies.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. This planning grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Engineering Research Center for In-Situ Control of the Nitrogen Cycle.  The program combines expertise in engineering, chemistry, data science and analytics, environmental science, and social and policy science, and establishes a flexible and robust process to identify and engage stakeholders. These stakeholders span academia, industry, and government, and will collaborate in the planning grant to define convergent research themes within four primary thrusts: (1) distributed fertilizer manufacturing, (2) efficient and controlled application of nitrogen fertilizer, (3) fertilizer recycling, and (4) nitrogen cycles as social-ecological systems. Development within these themes provides a platform for a sustainable ""closed loop approach"" for 21st century food supply, where nitrogenous fertilizers are efficiently produced, applied, and recycled at or near the site of application. Information gathered from the core team and stakeholders during the initial stages of the planning process will be developed into a formal set of technical goals within each of the four thrust areas.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to advance knowledge in the distributed small-scale ammonia production, the availability of nitrogen flow and application models, knowledge of soil and water chemistry and nitrogen-based environmental effects, and achieving a heightened understanding of the interface of technologies with socio-ecological systems. The proposed program establishes the necessary convergence approach required to address these challenges, while narrowing focus to challenges related to fertilizer inefficiencies, and to engineering-based approaches and adoption. The program brings broad expertise, including expertise required to link technology efforts with societal impact, establishes convergence research themes, and develops metrics appropriate for measuring progress towards these themes. <br/><br/>Over-production and application of nitrogen fertilizer in the developed world is responsible for a broad range of deleterious environmental effects, even while agriculture in the developing world suffers from a lack of bioavailable nitrogen. The planning grant catalyzes a process to solve challenges related to fertilizer production, application, and recycling, with additional focus on the regulatory and economic factors that ultimately connect engineering innovation with societal impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will stimulate the transformation of the way we travel and deliver goods and services.  Roadways and highways are not only national economic lifelines but impact every sphere of societal activities.  Next generation transportation infrastructure must have sufficient capacity, making it able to grow with the increasing demand and address the emerging connected, automated and shared vehicle technologies. It should also be resistant to interruptions, able to withstand all manner of regional natural hazards. Finally, it must be aesthetic, have negligible environmental impact, and use minimal resources.  These interrelated demands present an opportunity for a new era of intelligent transportation infrastructure based on new materials, sensing and automation, and greater interactions with the world.  We imagine future highway and roadway systems which extensively utilize cutting-edge (smart) materials, smart and adaptable infrastructure, smart transportation systems and physics-guided data science to achieve safety, resiliency, and efficiency.  Such an intelligent infrastructure will be able to sense, interpret and interact in real time with its environment. This allows for anticipation and adjustment to external stimuli, such as those posed by traffic and extreme events.  The planning grant activities will provide the platform for identification of key technical challenges, their potential solution hypotheses, and the disciplinary contributions that will lead to formation of the most effective ERC. <br/><br/>To identify key technical challenges to resilient transportation infrastructure, the planning team will engage deeply with stakeholders and domain experts. This will be done through a dedicated workshop, panel discussion(s) and a team building retreat.  The results of these engagements will form the basis for fine tuning the technical topics and coordination of the research agenda across the core areas and to define the linkages among the disciplines.  The expected outcome will be identification of a set of critical research issues and a broad yet convergent research program. This allows for a clear definition of the structure and roles within this envisioned multi-university center. These planning activities will also define the ways the center will be able to represent diverse institutions from the viewpoint of geography, types of students served (including minority students) as well as their location in or near major metropolitan areas.  The planned stakeholder engagement, workshop, and retreat are expected to impact the outlook of academic investigators towards these societal challenges, as well as how the stakeholders (e.g., industrial innovators, policymakers, citizens) perceive scientific research.  The planning activities will also engage graduate and undergraduate students to provide them exposure to emerging transdisciplinary research opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project vision is to transform the student entering an undergraduate computing and informatics program from a person with an interest in computing - to a person with an identity as a computing professional. The project will transform faculty attitude towards education, shifting their attitudes and behaviors away from knowledge transmission and lecturing toward a refreshed approach of developing educational activities that scaffold the computing knowledge and skills to build successful computing professionals. <br/><br/>The project will catalyze and sustain this transition with the identification of pedagogical design patterns to guide all faculty teaching courses in the undergraduate computing and informatics curriculum. Innovative teaching and assessment practices will be implemented across an entire undergraduate computing and informatics curriculum, demonstrating the applicability and efficacy of these practices across a student body; which is diverse in terms of socio-economic status and demographics. The project will develop taxonomies and design patterns for knowledge and assessment to facilitate scaling and disseminating educational innovation in computing. Additionally, the project will examine the key factors in building a sustainable practice of educational innovation, which includes faculty attitudinal shifts and infrastructures to support and sustain learning practices. The project will evaluate and disseminate pedagogical practices and lessons learned. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are: educational impact on a diverse student population (first time college students, ethnic diversity, GPA diversity); community impact on high schools and other partners in STARSComputingCorps.org; and professional impact on providing the talent pool for the region and the country in IT (including: data science, cyber security, visual analytics, and human centered design). Key outcomes from the Connected Learner project are anticipated to be: an increase in the quality of education provided to a diverse population of computing students, improved retention and graduation rates, the provision of a regional and national talent pool in computing, and the integration of pedagogical research with faculty development and advancement.

The first goal is to create a new instructional approach that middle school science teachers can use to teach the engineering design process. The second goal is to learn more about how middle school students propose, support, critique and revise design solutions. This project will result in new findings about how middle school students learn about the engineering design process, how they propose, support, critique and revise engineering designs; and how different aspects of instruction support or constrain middle school student use of disciplinary core ideas and cross-cutting concepts while engaging in the engineering design process. This project will directly impact four teachers and a diverse group of approximately 1000 students. Once the instructional model is developed, it has the potential to be adopted by teachers throughout the United States. This new approach to instruction will enable science teachers to integrate engineering concepts and practices into any middle school science course as prescribed by the Next Generation Science Standards - without needing to adopt or purchase an entirely new curriculum. In addition, the project has the potential to enhance interest in the field of engineering and to broaden the participation of women and minorities in engineering.<br/> <br/>The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for middle school science teachers to add engineering design into their curriculum so all students can learn to use core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and engineering practices to solve problems. This project uses a design-research mixed-methods approach. The project team will develop, implement and revise 4 prototype engineering design tasks (EDTs) based on a new instructional model called Argument-Driven Engineering (ADE). Iterative improvements of the instructional model and the EDTs will be made from analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. This project will result in the generation and validation of a new assessment of practices related to engineering design, referred to as the Scenario-based Assessment of Design (SAD). The SAD will be administered three times (pre-, mid- and post-) to track changes in students' knowledge and skills over time. Qualitative data, including the collection of video data of EDTs and student artifacts, will be analyzed using iterative content analysis.  This research project will also result in new findings about: a) how middle school students propose, support, critique and revise engineering design; b) how patterns of the these skills change over time; and c) what features of instruction support or constrain learning of the engineering design process. The results will be used to refine the ADE model so that it can be used effectively by teachers who incorporate engineering design in their classes."

This group of young people will be recruited from the Hall of Science's more than 100 Explainers, a very diverse group of young people who work part-time at the Hall of Science and engage with visitors as they explore the museum. Researchers will track participants' experiences and document their impact on museum visitors' perceptions of engineering. The expectation is that creating and delivering these experiences for visitors will have a positive impact on the youth participants' understanding of the engineering disciplines, and on visitors' perceptions of engineering and its relationship to everyday life.<br/><br/>The project will use observations, interviews, journaling and the Engineering Professional Skills Assessment to explore youth experience, and visitor exit surveys and interviews to probe visitor perceptions. Both the skills assessment and visitor surveys are NSF-funded instruments. Data coding will be grounded in the engineering habits of mind defined by the National Research Council's Committee on Understanding and Improving K-12 Engineering Education in the United States (2009). The project will capture evidence regarding which habits of mind the Fellows are most frequently engaged with. The effort will also explore how interactions with peers (as colleagues), with experts (as learners, such as with Designers in Residence) and with visitors (as teachers and leaders) may be associated with different combinations of the habits of mind over the course of the project. Visitor data and assessment data will allow the project to begin to make analytic connections between participating young people's increased understanding of culturally-situated engineering challenges, and their impact on the experiences of museum visitors who engage with engineering programming at the Hall of Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, many science teachers have no training in this area. Therefore, there is an urgent need to train teachers in the concepts of engineering design and methods for teaching it. There is also a need to collect research evidence on how teachers develop knowledge for teaching science through engineering design and the effect of their teaching practices on student learning. This research project is training pre-service science teachers in engineering design, developing their knowledge for teaching science through engineering design, and assessing the impact on their students' learning of and attitudes towards engineering design and science. Results from the project are providing research evidence on the development of pre-service teachers' knowledge of teaching science through engineering design, the resulting instructional practices, and the impact on student learning and attitude towards engineering design and science. This project will impact at least 1000 high school students directly, teaching them principle of engineering design. The impact of the project will be further magnified through the development of a manual on effective approaches for teaching engineering design in high schools. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to provide proven resources for preparing the future workforce for engineering challenges of the future.<br/><br/>The New Framework for K-12 Science Education, and the Next Generation Science Education Standards accentuate the integration of engineering design in K-12 science classrooms. However, many science teachers lack knowledge of engineering design.  Likewise, there is a paucity of research on science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering design integrated science (EDIS) teaching, and its effect on student achievement in engineering design and science. Clearly, the success of engineering design in K-12 science will largely depend on teachers' understanding of engineering design and their pedagogical content knowledge of EDIS teaching. Therefore, this study is addressing four objectives: train high school pre-service science teachers in engineering design; measure the development of the pre-service science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering design integrated science instruction; facilitate pre-service teachers' implementation of EDIS units in high schools; and assess the effect of the pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of engineering integrated science instruction on students' learning of and attitudes towards engineering design and science. The sample is comprised of two cohorts of 34 pre-service science teachers and 1428 high school students. The project is employing a two-cohort cluster randomized trial with repeated measures design of pre- and post-measures, where high school science classes serve as the cluster level.  Each pre-service teacher is teaching two science classes in high schools. Two classes nested within each pre-service teacher are divided into two groups, Traditional group and Engineering Design group. The Traditional group serves as a baseline for comparison to the Engineering Design group. Data is being collected using the Pedagogical Content Knowledge of EDIS Science Teaching instrument, the Engineering Design Skills and Engineering Design Attitudes questionnaire, Knowledge Integration Content Knowledge tests, the Engineering Design Process Knowledge Instrument, and the revised Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Multilevel and structural equation modeling and analytic induction are the data analysis techniques. The results will provide empirical evidence on the development of pre-service teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of EDIS teaching, the resulting instructional practices, and the impact on student learning and attitude towards engineering design and science. The project will significantly impact pre-service science teachers' engineering design skills, instructional practice, and student learning and attitude towards engineering design."

Not only has nanoHUB become the first broadly successful, scientific end-to-end cloud computing environment, but it also has evolved well beyond online simulation. Annually, nanoHUB provides a library of 3,000 learning resources to 195,000 users worldwide. Its 232 simulation tools, free from the limitations of running software locally, are used in the cloud by over 10,800 annually. Its impact is demonstrated by 720+ citations to nanoHUB in the scientific literature with over 4,807 secondary citations, yielding an h-index of 31, and by a median time from publication of a research simulation program to classroom use of less than 6 months. Cumulatively, over 14,000 students in over 760 formal classes in over 100 institutions have used nanoHUB simulations. <br/><br/>Despite a decade of transformational success for a broad nanotechnology research and education community, significant gaps remain as work is still performed by isolated individuals and small groups. This fragmentation by specialty hinders tool and data sharing across knowledge domains. Nano areas such as bio, photonics, and materials are only beginning to use nanoHUB while manufacturing, informatics, environmental-health-and-safety are to date not even represented on nanoHUB. The NCN Cyber Platform proposes to address these gaps through efforts in three strategic goals to: 1) accelerate research by transforming nanoscience to nanotechnology through the integration of simulation with experimentation; 2) inspire and educate the next-generation nanoscience and nanotechnology workforce; and 3) grow the nanoHUB society that uses and shares nanoHUB content. Five cross-cutting thrust areas focus on the cyberinfrastructure (CI) and social dynamics of the nanoHUB virtual society: CI innovation; content stewardship and node engagement; education research and precollege/college and lifelong learning; outreach, diversity, and marketing; and CI operations. The 10-year NCN nanoHUB Cyber Platform vision is that nanoHUB will be the online nano society that researchers, practitioners, educators and students depend on day-to-day while simultaneously immersed in professional practice and computational resources for a multidisciplinary culture of innovation grounded in cloud services-enabled workflows.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The NCN nanoHUB strategic plan will answer two fundamental challenges to the next-generation nanoHUB experience: 1) development of technologies that enable simple management and publication of scientific data (experimental and simulation) without additional complex steps: and 2) the establishment of a value system that fosters publication of data, tools, and lectures similar to today's rewards for journal publications. CI innovation, developed through the leading HUBzero platform as well as in cooperation with other CI efforts, will enable new connection points for research, education, and commercialization, expanded platform tool features to help users exchange and publish data; combined data and tools for verification, validation, and engineering activities; and increase immersive and pervasive features. Through partnerships with professional societies and commercial publishers, nanoHUB will change how researchers publish their simulation results through novel interactive journals that reflect a user's workflow, link directly back to their data, and make the work reproducible. This value system will drive new content toward nanoHUB, obviating the need for content generation to be monetarily supported by NCN. Through partnerships with the three new NCN content nodes and other NSF-funded nano efforts, NCN will continue to foster content creation to demonstrate value to the authors and will prototype, test, and host the proposed new technologies for broad usage.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: NCN has developed processes that enabled researchers to rapidly deploy their research codes and innovative tutorials and classes on nanoHUB. To date, these processes harvested research and educational results from 890 contributors world-wide. Expansion into new areas of nano research and education, including pre-college education, represent a huge growth potential for nanoHUB that goes beyond simulation to embracing data management, search, and exploration. Focus on diversity will continue to be an integral part of NCN's outreach program, in particular through focused workshops and new initiatives such as EPICS High. The NCN-pioneered HUBzero already powers 40 HUBs at 12 institutions, serving a broad range of science and engineering disciplines and commercialization. Through impact assessment and continual contributions to HUBzero software stack releases, nanoHUB will continue to drive impact beyond its nano society into other disciplines and institutions."

The results of this research will provide a framework for interventions that encourage more students from minority, urban, and low-SES contexts to pursue engineering career pathways. It will also provide insights into how to motivate and increase retention of undergraduate minority engineering students, and increase the number of socially engaged engineers. The goal of this research is to understand how framing engineering as an altruistic (pro-social) profession affects the career identity development of students from low-socioeconomic status and African American families who are enrolled in 8th - 10th grade in an urban area within a predominantly rural Southern state. An additional goal is understanding of how serving as a mentor in the program affects the engineering career identity of undergraduate engineering students from similar backgrounds. The focal population of students offer the largest untapped source of future engineers available in this region. In an iterative process, the career identity of students from this demographic participating in an existing informal science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education program will be explored. These findings to develop a yearlong ""Help Your Community and Your World program that highlights the societal impact of engineering and provides undergraduate  engineering student mentors/role models from similar backgrounds. Designing and implementing this program will lead to improved understanding of how career identity develops for these students. This work has the potential to impact the number and diversity of U.S. students entering the engineering workforce and facilitate a manufacturing and STEM workforce development and economic base in states that have historically had agricultural economic base and/or lower STEM workforce needs.<br/><br/>The research will use a mixed methods design with a heavy emphasis on qualitative data collection in the form of video (or other multimedia) reflections, and interviews. Quantitative data will be collected through surveys of student attitudes towards STEM, beliefs about their ability in STEM, and intentions to study STEM in the future. For the qualitative approach, we will use the Consensual Qualitative research approach with its emphasis on team-built understandings of interview data.  A student-centered approach will be taken in order to understand how students make sense of and come to understand their intersecting, and socially constructed identities. For the newly developed summer camp, the data will be analyzed in three stages: before the camp, during the camp, and after the camp. This will be done to create a snapshot of the students' career identities and perceptions of engineering at each time point. This will also help the researchers examine and compare how their definitions, goals, and identities altered throughout the camp. Then the findings from each snapshot will be collapsed together to identify the larger overarching themes from the data. This method allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the students' own meaning making about their career identities as they progress through the program, and what aspects of the program were salient for the students, and how interventions can better support identity development in students. The interview and survey data will be qualitatively analyzed and triangulated to identity underlying themes and repeated patterns in the data.  The results will be disseminated in hands on workshops of regional teachers and out of school facilitators as well as through traditional mechanisms such as publications and conference presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Informed by RET best practices, each summer, the community college faculty members will participate in a 9-week experience. This experience will include an 8-week independent research project in an engineering group in which faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students are active, available, and involved; and a 1-week team-based curriculum development experience, in which both experiences are placed in the context of a technology application that community college students find exciting, engaging and viable for a future career. During the next academic year, immediately following the faculty's summer experience, follow-up will include webinars, implementing their course module, demonstrating their course module at the RET Site's Context-Based Curriculum Development Workshop, and publishing the curriculum online.<br/><br/>The RET Site programmatic effort will foster community college teachers' understanding of the process of research by engaging in authentic, in-depth, engineering-related research experiences in innovative and cutting-edge topics, such as alternative energy, cyber security and industrial internet, green and sustainability manufacturing, and wearable medical devices. As a result, teachers may in turn engage their community college students in technology-driven education activities through context-based curriculum developed during the research experience. The RET Site will also contribute to research in science and engineering education by providing data on how research experiences influence teachers and their teaching in community college classrooms.<br/><br/>The teacher participants will return to their home community colleges with new skills and tools to teach new scientific and engineering principles in technology contexts that students can relate to and hopefully, will aspire to participate in. Thus, the broader impact of this Context-Based RET Site lies in the potential of increasing engagement and persistence and thus, eventually the retention rate, among community college students majoring in STEM, particularly among entry-level community college students. Given the demographics of community colleges, the RET Site should also contribute to increasing the understanding of math, science and engineering concepts, skills and careers among women and underrepresented minority students. Additionally, this program, especially with its post-program Context-Based Curriculum Development Workshop, will further cultivate and sustain a vibrant network of community college teachers, faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate student researchers with the potential of long-term collaborative partnerships."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to plan the Engineering Research Center for Adaptive and Resilient Coastal Infrastructure (CARCI).  Our vision is to create a new research center to enhance the safety, equity and quality of life for people living in coastal regions, to promote economic prosperity and global competitiveness given the importance of industrial activity in coastal locales, and to improve the harmony among the built-natural-social systems in coastal regions. Envisioning the future of our coastal communities is challenging: on the one hand promising new technologies could reshape our societies ? the so-called fourth Industrial Revolution, and on the other hand as our infrastructure becomes more complex and interdependent, we are vulnerable to chronic and acute hazards.  For example, the cumulative cost of weather-related disasters in the U.S. in 2017 was $309.5 billion, impacting many coastal communities in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Sea level rise and changing storm patterns will exacerbate these impacts on coastal communities. All the while, coastal cities need smart reinvestment strategies for decades-old civil infrastructure to accommodate growing populations and new technologies.  Balancing the social, economic, and ecological costs and benefits strategies for both adaptation (medium-to-long term) and resilience (short-to-medium term) is crucial for increasing community prosperity and well-being from diverse perspectives. Regardless of alternatives, coastal solutions require a convergence of many disciplines: engineering, economics, urban planning, public policy and health, social science, risk management, decision-making, coastal ecology and marine sciences. <br/><br/>For this planning grant, we will hold three team building meetings to evolve a team of qualified researchers to create a research center with key ideas such as stakeholder knowledge-to-action-networks to enable the co-production of knowledge; performance-based coastal engineering and a new adaptive coastal engineering design paradigm; envisioning coastal risk, resilience and adaptation; natural, nature-based and bio-inspired infrastructure; and systems-level and data-driven decision-making. We have outlined an iterative and adaptive team formation process for CARCI, and throughout this process we will seek competing research pathways to achieve team-wide adaptive and resilient coastal system visions and retain the most transformative and participatory plan as the basis for CARCI.  In addition to the team meeting, two workshops will be convened to understand stakeholder needs and opportunities, including education and workforce development. Two workshop reports will be generated and will be distributed as described in the Data Management Plan.  The planning process will allow the team to identify innovative strategies to solve some of the most pressing problems facing our coastal communities:  how to balance adaptive strategies in the medium-to-long term with societal needs for resilience in the short-to-medium term. The team will identify new opportunities in the areas of distributed and hierarchical modeling, data-driven technology, optimization and decision-making, and natural and bio-inspired solutions. Through two stakeholder workshops, we will bring together a diverse coastal community stakeholder of researchers, practitioners, decision-makers and others to identify key needs, gaps and opportunities for coastal infrastructure adaptation and resilience, and will be distributed openly to contribute to shaping future research and education.  Our team science and leadership science webinar series will have broader impacts on researchers and administrators in furthering convergent research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly worrisome given that the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2020, half of all STEM jobs will be in computing. Several research advances and technological innovations have fundamentally changed the computing discipline in recent years. Such advances include cloud and mobile computing, web technologies, high-performance computing, social media, big data, and machine learning. Similar advances have also occurred in learning science and educational technologies. Learning science informs how students actually learn and educational technologies leverage mobile computing and learning analytics to enable formal and informal learning. Millennial students learn differently and the above advances provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance student learning. This project seeks to dramatically improve computer science students' retention and graduation rates through a transformational process that involves curricular innovations, design and development of inclusive pedagogy, and faculty development. Both technical and professional skills will be interspersed throughout the curriculum to better prepare them for industry careers. The project addresses diversity in student learning through personalization and  enables a significant increase in the participation of underrepresented groups in computing education and careers. Lastly, the project strives to increase the number of transfer students from community colleges and early college high schools completing undergraduate computing degrees in universities. The results of the project will be widely disseminated across the country to help other computer science departments improve their students' success.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are (1) transform the programming-centric computer science education approach to a systems-oriented and software engineering-centric one, (2) infuse professional skills development process into the entire curriculum, (3) dramatically increase retention and graduation rates, (4) recruit significantly more students from underrepresented groups (5) personalize teaching and learning in both formal and informal settings, and (6) work with community colleges and early college high schools in the region to increase the number of transfer students and enhance their success in college. The project is both innovative and revolutionary. The project will design a non-course-centric curriculum, develop an innovative and inclusive pedagogy, use free and open-source software to provide a compelling and contextualized teaching and learning environment. Professional skills development will be interspersed throughout the curriculum through team projects, internship and co-op opportunities, undergraduate research and entrepreneurship, and professional networking. The project will improve retention and graduation rates by employing research-based approaches such as providing motivating and inviting academic environment, proactive efforts in student advising and degree planning, and fostering positive faculty-student relationships. Participation of underrepresented groups will be significantly increased through collaborative partnerships with community colleges and early college high schools. Personalization of teaching and learning materials will be achieved through structuring and development of materials through fine-granular authoring and semantic markup. To overcome faculty resistance barriers, the project employs a change model which is based on Appreciative Inquiry, which reflects local context and constraints. The change model drives the research questions we investigate in the project. It takes an unprecedented, bold, and systemic approach to the professional formation of software engineers."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>San Jose State University and University of California, Davis are partnering with Lawrence Livermore National Labs to plan for a potential Engineering Research Center in Cognitive Neuroengineering. Cognitive NeuroEngineering is the next step in the evolution of human interactions with machines. Today, machines are poised to make this important leap: from interfacing with our peripheral nervous system using sight, touch, and sound to interfacing directly with our central nervous system to usher in a world in which everyone will command computers, household machines and other assistive devices simply by thinking about what they want to do. It is in our nation?s interest to be at the forefront of this new engineering discipline and to addresses the cognitive implications of directly interfacing machines with the central nervous system.  To promote the progress of science and ensure the nation's health, prosperity and welfare we will develop a diverse team that can effectively address the mission of the proposed ERC and create a Center that has the greatest opportunity for socioeconomic impact. To accomplish this, this project will engage a broad range of stakeholders, from scientist and engineers to clinicians and end-users to improve opportunities for better understanding and trust between these communities. In addition, the specialized knowledge that each community brings will be leveraged to create synergistic partnerships that advances the scientific, educational, and ethical aspects of this new field. Recommendations for national workforce development and any changes to our regulatory environment will be made.  There are three major expected benefits of this proposal.  The first is to optimize diversity of the stakeholder community to maximize the potential societal benefit of this new field of Cogntive Neuroengineering. The second is improved team dynamics to empower stakeholders to contribute regardless of status and power differences. The third is more effective leadership by utilizing evidence based research in team science.<br/><br/>Just as Human Factors Engineering has grown into Cognitive Engineering, Cognitive NeuroEngineering goes beyond current neuroprosthetic applications and addresses the cognitive implications of directly interfacing machines with the central nervous system. This potential ERC represents one of the most important new challenges of the future of work at the human-technology frontier. Using team-based science, this ERC will embrace convergent research and address the complexity of interfacing with the central nervous system and its impact on cognition. Novel data analytic approaches will be developed, a greater understanding of human cognition will be achieved and innovative neurotechnologies will be created that are expected to impact society beyond the goals of the proposed ERC.  To develop the proposed ERC in Cognitive Neuroengineering, this planning grant will be used to 1) enable a series of planning meetings that culminate in three workshops, 2) travel between the partner institutions and to relevant stakeholder communities for first hand exchanges of partner resources and 3) engage a profession facilitator in strategic planning as well as two experts, one in convergent science and the other in the team science. The three workshops revolve around our four Objectives. The first Objective is to identify strengths and weaknesses of our ERC. The second Objective is to identify opportunities for deployment of our proposed engineering system and opportunities for diversity. The third Objective is to fully develop the team and stakeholder community using the latest techniques of team science, including improving our ability to articulate the societal impacts. The fourth Objective is to write the ERC proposal. This planning grant will have the greatest impact on the formulation of a set of strategic objectives and metrics for our ERC. This will allow us to consider carefully and more deeply understand the societal impact of our ERC. Since groups are more likely to engage when they identify with the societal impact of a project, this will improve stakeholder engagement. In addition, the activities are expected to develop new ways of thinking to ease the significant communication and philosophical difference among stakeholders and facilitate the transdisciplinary nature of the ERC whose constituents have significant communication and philosophical differences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The engineering field struggles to develop sufficient interest and sustained participation across underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. This project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by developing a course to engage rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and to determine best practices that attract and retain these students. It is critical to foster interest in engineering during formative years when students are deciding career paths. The College created a Fridays@Northeast program that targets high school seniors, offering them the opportunity to learn from College faculty in Northeast lab spaces and classrooms to earn early college credit. Using this platform, a Pre-Engineering Multidisciplinary Design course augmented with the incorporation of a maker design area is taught at two of the community college's campuses to high school students. A maker design area outfitted with a set of prototype and model development tools and equipment allows the students to conduct activities that increase problem-solving and creativity while the course dispels misconceptions and transforms careers in engineering into a tangible and viable option. Variability in the student diversity between the campuses, such as racial, ethnic, or rural/metropolitan origin, facilitates educational research to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. Researchers are investigating how the activities increase problem-solving and creativity experiences, and how they influence diverse high school student postsecondary career pathway selection into engineering and STEM related careers.<br/><br/>This project addresses the shortage of diverse students entering into engineering fields by creating a course that engages rural and underrepresented high school students in maker design and creativity and determines the best practices that attract and retain these students. The high school students are provided learning activities and career exploration that help them understand engineering design and creativity while earning college credit. Educational researchers work with instructors to collect data through a multi-phase mixed methods design to develop a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from diverse backgrounds. They collect baseline and relevant continuing data on student background, academic preparation, engineering perceptions, career interests, course engagement, and overall student experiences. This is accomplished through a combination of student assessments, interest inventories, recorded class sessions reviews, and in-person class visits. This research will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups including women and individuals from rural, Hispanic, or Native American origin. The theoretical models derived by the project will be shared in state-wide education conferences and nationally to secondary schools, post-secondary institutions, and industry at National Science Teachers Association and American Society for Engineering Education conferences. In addition, project materials including curriculum, technical reports, and de-identified linked supporting data will be shared with the larger STEM community at the University of Nebraska Lincoln's Digital Commons open access repository. To preserve data access, the de-identified dataset and study codebook will be submitted to the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan as public-use data files and will subsequently be created into substantive metadata. Overall, this project supports exploratory work on untested, but potentially transformative research that will create a theoretical explanation for the development of interest in engineering careers for students from underrepresented demographic groups and will advance understanding of the professional formation of engineers."

Why does ECS remain stubbornly segregated when it comes to gender parity? The goal of this CAREER project is to use ethnography to compare subfields of ECS in which women have different levels of participation. It investigates the relationship between cultural values, norms and practices that 1) presume practitioners from dominant groups are more competent than practitioners from underrepresented groups; and 2) privilege the technical dimensions of computing over the social ones. The uneven participation of women across ECS subfields suggests that subfield cultural values and norms vary. To examine this variation, this project focuses primarily on the experiences of female faculty members because they are a critical population that shape the next generation of ECS practitioners, have a long-standing relationships with their disciplinary subfields, and may have experiences that could lend critical insights into the social/technical divide. The project's findings articulate and forge pathways toward broadening participation in ECS because they inform learning modules and course curricula to educate students, faculty, and leaders in academia about the benefits of diversity and transformations required to foster welcoming environments for women to participate in ECS with equal opportunities, resources and regard. Due to the prominence and impact of ECS, identifying gender inequities in the field and interrupting them will help welcome and retain more talented women from a range of intersectional identities. Harnessing the power of diversity in this way will positively contribute to all domains on which computing impinges.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is a comparative analysis of the impact of subfield culture on women's representation in ECS. It deconstructs theoretical assumptions undergirding ECS practices to understand how complex, intersectional biases disenfranchise women from the field. To yield new knowledge useful in efforts to broaden participation, this CAREER project systematically conceptualizes how labor segregation may relate to an ideological hierarchy between the social and technical dimensions of computing and influence cultural exclusions along intersecting vectors of gender and race. Using a theory-driven, interdisciplinary research approach that integrates gender and racial equity research, anthropology and science and technology studies, this CAREER project works to: 1) Develop and refine a theoretical model of change in ECS to combat the covert and overt mechanisms that marginalize women; 2) Describe and analyze epistemic bias emerging from ideologies that consider empirical data superior to qualitative data and trivialize socially applied research in ECS; 3) Identify and assess elements of culture in ECS that reproduce or challenge inequitable power relations; 4) Describe women's differential experiences in ECS subfields along vectors of race, ethnicity, and gender identity; 5) Develop and analyze educational interventions into ECS culture that spring from an original method integrating ethnography and case study methods to both interrupt the reproduction of dominant class rule and to study the beliefs and power relations of computing communities. Not only does this project contribute a novel qualitative theory of cultural change in ECS, it also tests innovative methods to better elucidate who and what counts in the field and why. Further, it creates highly adaptable and sustainable techniques that provide opportunities for engineers to practice recognizing and responding to bias in social dynamics and articulating means of institutional change in communion with their peers. Finally, this project provides much needed anthropological theory to the problem of women's underrepresentation in ECS to advance inclusive educational practices that support and capitalize on the aptitudes of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the situation is gradually changing  at the PreK-12 level, relative to the other STEM subjects, at the PreK-12 level, engineering is still very much outside the mainstream. This is reflected in the scant availability of pre-service engineering teacher preparation programs, the dearth of high-quality student assessments in engineering, the lack of mechanisms for recognizing educator skill in engineering education, and the absence of clear professional pathways for PreK-12 engineering educators who demonstrate proficiency. The project will consider how the current system might be adapted to better support the development and employment of precollege engineering educators. The project is timely given a number of recent developments, including the 2013 publication of the Next Generation Science Standards, which call on science teachers to connect science concepts and practices to those in engineering; the expected fall 2015 release of results of the first-ever national assessment of Technology and Engineering Literacy; the College Board's plan to develop an AP Advanced Placement course in Eengineering course; and increasing interest in more integrated forms of K-12 STEM education in both formal and informal (e.g., the Maker Movement) environments. The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>The 18-month project will be overseen by a diverse committee of experts appointed by The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The committee will conduct a variety of data-gathering activities, including an in-depth review of the relevant literature; a landscape scan of existing pre- and in-service programs for PreK-12 engineering educators; and two topical workshops. This information will allow the committee to address the project's four objectives: <br/><br/>- Determine what is known from the published literature about the preparation of PreK-12 educators to teach about engineering, identifying areas of promising practice as well as areas in need of further research;<br/> <br/>- Catalog existing US pre-service and in-service programs that support the preparation and professional development of PreK-12 engineering educators, describing the nature (e.g., curriculum) and history of the programs and, if known, the number of educators reached and the evidence for impact (e.g., on individual teaching practice and the growth of PreK-12 engineering education locally, regionally, or nationally);<br/><br/>- Review existing formal (e.g., state certification) and informal (e.g., ""badging"") mechanisms that are being or might be used to recognize expertise and support career pathway options for PreK-12 teachers of engineering, noting practical and policy impediments and how they might be addressed; and <br/><br/>- Explore the potential for the post-secondary education community, including but not limited to four-year engineering and engineering technology programs, to take a more active role in the preparation of teachers of PreK-12 engineering. <br/><br/>At the conclusion of the project, the committee will publish a report summarizing its findings and making recommendations for how the current education system might be adapted to better support the development and employment of precollege engineering educators."

While there have been many initiatives to increase the representation of underrepresented minority faculty, systematic efforts have not been designed to address the completion of doctoral degrees amongst this population. Data show that students, particularly underrepresented students, are leaving before obtaining a degree because of the long, arduous, and uncertain road to graduation. These data also suggest that individuals, graduate schools, and society would benefit from efforts to reduce time-to-degree and degree completion rates. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to offer a practical and timely experience particularly for underrepresented doctoral students in engineering (African American, Native American, Pacific Island and Hispanic American) to address issues germane to shortening time-to-degree and degree completion rates. The specific aims are to: 1) conduct research to understand the motivational factors that promote and detract from degree progress and 2) to develop and offer the Dissertation Institute (Institute) to provide underrepresented doctoral students in engineering with motivating, helpful strategies for avoiding pitfalls that prolong completion times, particularly those at the dissertation proposal preparation and dissertation completion stages. Current efforts to support underrepresented doctoral students have tended to be local opportunities within specific programs or universities. This project is different from existing efforts because it will systematically examine and positively impact the motivational factors that promote dissertation completion across multiple sites to consider and incorporate contextually relevant factors such that the Institute is transferable across contexts and not limited to local implementation. This transferability is critical to developing a sustainable future program to support underrepresented students. This project addresses strategic goals of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and critical needs of the nation related to enhanced global competitiveness and an improved national economy.<br/><br/>This project is grounded in the expectancy-value theory of motivation and will result in two sets of outcomes: research outcomes and direct benefits to participants. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods, the research outcomes will include: 1) contextually relevant and nationally representative research-based data we can use to inform the Institute's design regarding the success beliefs and values that contribute to and detract from students' dissertation success, 2) measures of Institute effectiveness in terms of participant's increased beliefs about succeeding in and the value of completing a dissertation, and 3) a list of variables to which academics should pay attention when designing transferable versions of the Institute. To achieve the outcomes of our study, we have designed a multi-method, multi-phased study. We will examine and draw on stakeholder needs to develop an Institute that is consistent with literature suggestions and effective practices but also contextually relevant for participants. Finally, we will comparatively analyze the data across sites to allow us to identify the key elements on which we should focus in considering transferability of the Institute to additional sites and/or through online means. The research will directly impact approximately 170 underrepresented doctoral students and will contribute to the long-term sustainability of other Institute models. In addition to improving basic writing habits and skills, Institute participants will gain practical strategies for: 1) distinguishing between behaviors that foster or hinder success, 2) increasing engagement in positive behaviors and eliminating destructive behaviors, 3) developing plans to maneuver through the dissertation phase from selecting a topic to completing the dissertation, and 4) establishing realistic program completion goals and plans for implementing those goals. As a result of participation, students will gain specific skills in synthesizing and evaluating findings from the literature to aid in developing a dissertation proposal or for writing a dissertation. They will learn how to identify helpful, credible resources (people, physical and online) and how to use them effectively. Participants will also learn about developing and writing conference papers and publishable manuscripts from the dissertation, an important part of being ready for future employment. In combination, the project outcomes will have immediate impacts on participants while setting the stage for longer-term benefits."

Furthermore, in collaboration with the Cooperative Extension program at each of the investigators' home institutions, teaching and informative briefs will be disseminated to K-16 STEM teachers and communities through conferences such as the National Science Teacher Association, American Education Research Association, American Society of Engineering Education, and STEMTech. Overall, this work could influence makerspace leaders, engineering faculty members, undergraduate engineering students, and researchers and policymakers interested in makerspaces and STEM education."

This can be especially true of students who may not have easy access to academic and extracurricular activities, including diverse students from rural and urbans populations. Research has shown that incorporating engineering-related educational games into middle school curricula can help students develop an identity as an engineer. This project focuses on fourth grade students because this is a pivotal age where many students from underrepresented groups opt out of an engineering educational trajectory. This project develops and introduces educational games for fourth grade classrooms that demonstrate engineering concepts. The effect of playing these games, which are co-designed with teachers, will be studied in terms students' sense of engineering and how the way they identify with engineering as a result. The study will collect a variety of data from students about their related educational experiences. The data, including notebook entries, interviews, and focus groups, will help researchers investigate and generalize the efficacy of such games for promoting helping middle school students identify with the potential to pursue a career path in engineering. Descriptions of the educational game experiences, their classroom implementations, and assessments on student engineering identity formation will be shared freely.<br/><br/>Recent studies show large positive effects of small educational interventions when employing integrative frameworks that are culturally-responsive, chronically-salient and identity-congruent.  Additionally, digital game-based learning has demonstrated significant promise in elementary engineering education.  This project will operationalize the identity-based motivation framework via digital game-based learning experiences aimed at enhancing engineering identity formation of diverse elementary students.  Assessment of students' engineering identity will be made using instruments including the ""Draw an Engineer Test"" and the ""Engineering Identity Development Scale."" The identity-based motivation framework will inform the interventions, which will include students' creation of engineering characters who will interactively solve basic engineering problems.  The interventions will integrate humanitarian engineering applications of math and science, with lesson plans mapped to the Next Generation Science Standards and aligned with Essential Understandings within Montana's Indian Educational for All Act.  Assessment of students' post-intervention engineering identities will augment analyses of interviews, focus groups and game play artifacts in elucidating intervention features effective in enhancing engineering identity formation.  Data collection and analysis will rely on innovative qualitative methods, including effects matrices and network analyses, to determine the influence of the educational intervention experiences on students' engineering identity.  This mixed-method research will result in a deeper understanding of students' attitudes and dispositions toward engineering, and the features of the intervention design, development and/or experiences that influenced them.  This research will also result in adoptable educational interventions designed to encourage engineering identity formation in a diverse group of students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, no standardized educational program exists for pre-college students to earn widely accepted, transferable, engineering course credits. In addition, there are no nationally offered professional development programs to train and certify highly qualified, secondary teachers to support an undergraduate-level engineering course at the pre-college level. An Engineering for US All (E4USA), one-year high school course has the potential to 'democratize' the learning and practice of engineering by engaging high school students and their teachers to think and practice engineering principles and design practices, like an engineer. E4USA would be equivalent to placement credit for an introductory college course, such as: 1) core engineering; or 2) an elective; or 3) a substitute required course in the general education sequence. The impact might well go beyond an E4USA credit, through the credentialing of a broad range of STEM trained teachers to instruct and assess engineering principles and design-based experiences, and therefore become cornerstones supporting the introduction of engineering principles and design as outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The E4USA framework will focus on three ""big ideas:"" 1) Engineering and Society; 2) Engineering Processes; and 3) Essential Engineering Content, Skills and Tools. Credit would be earned by students through two integrated pathways: 1) a standard's based curriculum covering the Principles of Engineering; and 2) a submission of a design project. The national pilot will be lead by the University of Maryland College Park and  include Arizona State University, Morgan State University, Vanderbilt University, Virginia Tech, a dissemination collaboration with NASA, and a sampling of some 70 high schools across the United States.<br/><br/>Engineering for US All (E4USA) would help to 'demystify' and 'democratize' engineering, and empower science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers to gain the self-efficacy, self-confidence and skills to teach and assess their students engineering-based competencies. No standardized programs currently exist at a national level to train and certify high school teachers to support a one-year high school course based on engineering principles and a design-based experience. Our proposed national pilot would enable the standardized and centralization of data collection from across the United States, thus tracking STEM teachers and their students' trajectories of learning engineering concepts through competency-based evaluations and design project submissions. A national, data repository will be created and updated at the University of Maryland to track the training of the teachers, and their students. The research will explore if: 1) a broader diversity of students will consider engineering as an academic and career option; 2) professional development (PD) can enable teachers to apply engineering concepts across STEM disciplines to train students to tackle and solve problems; and 3) the piloting of the PD models can be used to certify highly qualified teachers. Projected outcomes will include: 1) a hybrid (e.g., in-person and online) PD model that prepares STEM teachers to gain the confidence, instructional skills and assessment competencies to support E4USA; 2) guidelines for the use of a Learning Management Systems and on-line analytical tools to collect data from a diverse sampling of teachers, students, institutions, and high schools; 3) E4USA  course materials and resources; and 4) E4USA models that can be aligned to state and local high school graduation requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are many published studies that link participation in various types of extra-curricular activities, such as social clubs and volunteerism, on academic and social development, little is written about the effect of participation in more engineering-based organizations.  This project seeks to study: (1) why students participate in co-curricular engineering activities, such as engineering honors and professional societies and design teams, (2) whether such participation confers benefits to the participants and helps them develop into professional engineers, and (3) how we might leverage those benefits to attract and retain students who are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including women, African American, Hispanic, and first generation students.  Findings from this project will lay the groundwork for future efforts that will include the design of engineering-based activities that benefit a diverse student body based on concrete data and evidence rather than on intuition.<br/><br/>It is widely presumed that as long as programs such as engineering honors and professional societies, and design teams are rationally designed, they are beneficial in building social capital, enforcing self-efficacy, and establishing a solid engineering identity.  However, there is very little in the literature specifically in engineering education to support such claims. This project seeks to answer three major research questions:<br/>1. What are the characteristics of the students who currently participate in engineering-centered co-curricular activities?<br/>2. What are the outcomes of participation on academic performance and persistence, and on psychosocial factors such as motivation, social capital, and engineering identity?<br/>3. How can these benefits be transferred to students who are underrepresented in who that are underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including women, African American, Hispanic, and first generation students?<br/>The professional development portion of this project will be accomplished by leveraging the expertise of scholars who have a combination of technical content knowledge, practical experience in student organizations, a grounding in theoretical frameworks, and quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis expertise. A direct outcome of this research will be the thoughtful and efficacious design of programs that attract and retain more students into science and engineering disciplines, especially those coming from underrepresented and underserved populations.   In addition, this work will pilot an engineering education research development plan and thus build capacity for engineering faculty to conduct engineering education research and scholarship."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Between 2016 and 2050, the number of older adults (age>65) in the US will grow from 49 million to 84 million. The combination of the growing aging population with increasingly complex care needs presents a major societal challenge to deliver safe, effective and efficient health care. While older adults prefer to stay in their home or a familiar environment, they also require health services, but are at high risk for patient safety issues and healthcare-associated harm when interacting with the healthcare delivery system. We need to develop technologies that can help older adults stay healthy and safe longer: this includes supporting safe interactions of older adults with the healthcare system (e.g. emergency room, hospital). We plan to develop an ERC for Healthy and Safe Aging (ERC-HSA) that will engage multiple disciplines (engineering, health sciences) and older adults and their caregivers to develop older-care-application-specific smart sensing technologies and integrate them into the overall coordinated older adult care system. The proposed ERC-HSA will be integrated in the newly created Wisconsin Institute for Healthcare Systems Engineering at UW-Madison and will benefit from complementary expertise of researchers at other Universities. During the ERC planning stage, we will work with various universities and local groups to develop strategies and programs aimed at enhancing diversity of our future students and addressing ageism, i.e. biases targeted at older adults. We will also build stronger ties with the health technology industry in the Greater Madison area as well as along the ?Health Highway?, a 600-mile Midwestern stretch that spans four states and represents a growing healthcare ecosystem.<br/><br/>The proposed ERC-HSA will develop a convergent research agenda organized around expertise in sensor technologies, data analytics and system design that will be combined with deep knowledge about aging care to develop technologies that effectively address the societal problem of healthy and safe aging. With advice of experts in strategic planning, team science, diversity and aging, we will coordinate various activities, including webinar on team science and team research, targeted roundtables and a workshop with industry. We will organize roundtables to develop the innovative convergent research program and create opportunities for conversations among researchers from various backgrounds. Older adults and their caregivers and healthcare professionals will actively participate in these activities as we propose to do research not on older adults, but with and for older adults. We will blend expertise in three thrust areas: (1) human-centered modeling, simulation and design of patient work and clinical workflow, (2) health/healthcare data analytics, and (3) sensors and sensing technologies. Our goal is to go beyond designing siloed and fragmented technologies and promote innovative convergent research that will design the next generation of technologies for healthy and safe aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this reason, many undergraduate engineering programs require first-year students to take an Introduction to Engineering Design course in which teams of students work to design a product or solution. Because these courses can be large, universities often employ undergraduate or graduate teaching assistants to help the student teams make progress. However, these teaching assistants often face two major challenges. First, although it is easy to simply tell the student teams what to do, it is much harder for teaching assistants to cultivate their students' design thinking, which can enable students to surmount obstacles and arrive at their own solutions. Second, university engineering programs, reflecting the engineering profession, include disproportionately few women, students from certain minority groups, and students from lower-income backgrounds; and teaching assistants often need to make sure that these underrepresented students (as well as quieter students from all backgrounds) get to participate equitably in the student teams. In this project, researchers and engineering educators at the University of Maryland are testing a new approach to teaching the teaching assistants in engineering design courses. The teaching assistants take a pedagogy course intended to prepare them to foster the student teams' design thinking and equitable participation of all team members. As a result, the students of these teaching assistants become better at engaging in collaborative engineering design, which sets them up to become better engineers once they enter the profession. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project staff is teaching a 3-credit pedagogy course to undergraduate teaching assistants, based on the Learning Assistant model from the University of Colorado. The pedagogy course integrates topics from general STEM learning-assistant pedagogy courses, such as the cognitive science of learning, facilitation of classroom discourse, and metacognition, with topics targeting engineering design: design reviews, design thinking, expert vs. novice practices in design, engineering epistemology, teamwork and equity.  Research on the effects of the pedagogy course addresses two overarching research questions: (1) How do teaching assistants' interactions with Engineering Design students affect the students' immediate actions, and what effects do students think the teaching assistants have on their longer-term growth, with respect to (a) design thinking and (b) enactment of equity as reflected in communication, teamwork, etc.  (2) How does the pedagogy course influence teaching assistants' pedagogical beliefs and interactions with students, with respect to how the teaching assistants notice and respond to (a) students' design thinking and (b) threats to equity. The research team is taking a design-based research approach, an iterative cycle of (i) collecting and analyzing data, (ii) forming hypotheses about how and why the teaching assistants did and did not learn specific ideas or enact those ideas in their classroom instruction, and (iii) testing those hypotheses by modifying the next round of the pedagogy course. Data include selected coursework from the pedagogy course; videorecordings of teaching assistants' interactions with student teams and what the teams do after the teaching assistant leaves; post-semester surveys of the videorecorded student teams about their experiences with the teaching assistant; and multiple interviews with the teaching assistants about particular instructional decisions they made. This work informs the creation and improvement of courses and programs that aim to prepare teaching assistants for engineering design courses."

Increase in the number of students pursuing engineering degrees is taking place but the percentages of underrepresented students in the engineering pipeline remains low. To address the challenge of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering, the National Society of Black Engineers, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and the Society of Women Engineers have formed the 50K Coalition, a collaborative of over 40 organizations committed to increasing the number of bachelors degrees awarded to women and minorities from 30,000 annually to 50,000 by 2025, a 66% increase. The 50K Coalition is using the Collective Impact framework to develop an evidence-based approach that drives management decision-making, improvements, sharing of information, and collective action to achieve success. The first convening of the 50K Coalition in April, 2016, brought together 83 leaders of the engineering community representing 13 professional societies with over 700,000 members, deans of engineering, minority engineering and women in engineering administrators from 11 leading colleges of engineering, and corporate partners representing six global industries. Consensus was reached on the following Common Agenda items: 1.) Undergraduate support and retention; 2.) Public awareness and marketing; 3.) K-12 support; 4.) Community College linkages; 5.) Culture and climate. The Coalition will encourage member organizations to develop new programs and scale existing programs to reach the goal.<br/><br/>The Coalition will use shared metrics to track progress:  AP® Calculus completion and high school graduation rates; undergraduate freshmen retention rates; community college transfer rates and number of engineering degrees awarded. The 50K Coalition will develop the other elements of the Collective Impact framework:  Infrastructure and effective decision-making processes that will become the backbone organization with a focus on data management, communications and dissemination; a system of continuous communication including Basecamp, website, the annual Engineering Scorecard, WebEx hosted meetings and convenings; and mutually reinforcing activities such as programs, courses, seminars, webinars, workshops, promotional campaigns, policy initiatives, and institutional capacity building efforts. The National Academy of Sciences study, Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation: America's Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads recommended that professional associations make recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups an organizational goal and implement programs designed to reach that goal by working with their membership, academic institutions and funding agencies on new initiatives. While these types of organizations work together now in a variety of ways, the relationships are one-on-one. The 50K Coalition brings together, for the first time professional societies, engineering schools, and industry to consider what mutually reinforcing activities can most effectively encourage students from underrepresented groups to complete calculus and graduate from 4-year engineering programs."

Nanotechnology now is a multidisciplinary field where devices are designed for applications in a diverse array of fields such as electronics, medicine, and energy using principles from engineering, physics, materials science, chemistry, computing, and biology. The safe and successful application of nanotechnology in the biological realm demands an advance in the original vision of Feynman due to the inherent multiscale nature of biology. Engineering of these nanoBIO devices must be based on the knowledge of how nanotechnology-based devices interact with biological systems at the protein, cell, tissue, and organ levels. The Engineered nanoBIO node at Indiana University (IU) will develop a powerful set of integrated computational nanotechnology tools that address this complex, multiscale problem and facilitate the discovery of customized, efficient, and safe nanoscale devices for biological applications. These computational tools will be tested and validated experimentally, and they will be integrated with IU's key cyberinfrastructure strengths in high-performance computing and scalable data-analysis platforms. They will meet critical national health needs as they find applications in nanomedicine by significantly enhancing the targeting and imaging capabilities of engineered nanoparticles, thus increasing our ability to generate new life-saving medicines for cancer treatment. <br/> <br/>The node will engage several groups at IU, including: the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering (ISE), the Biocomplexity Institute, the Department of Chemistry, the Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI), and the Digital Science Center. It will integrate advanced parallel computing middleware with the Network for Computational Nanotechnology Cyber Platform (nanoHUB). The node will be headquartered at the ISE, a department that is uniquely positioned to make nanoHUB the place for collaborative interactions of the interdisciplinary nanoBIO community and training of students in nanoengineering and bioengineering focused subjects. The node will interact with Science Gateways Community Institute in a broad outreach program targeting under-represented communities through workshops and workforce development forums.<br/> <br/>Nanomaterials-based devices offer unprecedented opportunities for the targeting, imaging, and manipulation of biological systems and have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases including cancer. However, this excitement about the potential of nanotechnology in the biomedical field is tempered by concerns about the outcomes of the interactions between engineered nanomaterials and biological systems, because we lack a sufficient fundamental understanding to link intrinsic nanoparticle features and incubation conditions to nanoparticle assembly and transport, single-cell and multicellular behavior, and ultimately therapeutic response. The Engineered nanoBIO node at Indiana University will address this complex problem by developing new nanoscience modeling and computational tools that span a wide range of biologically relevant length and time scales. <br/><br/>The node aims to create computational tools designed for cutting-edge research to develop biocompatible, safe, and efficient nanoscale devices. The node plans to contribute tools that: 1) design functional nanoparticles and self-assembled nanostructures with user-selected physicochemical, mechanical, and biocompatible properties, 2) evaluate and control nanodevice-cell interactions and establish nanodevice-cell phenotype links, and 3) enable the engineering of multicellular systems using the nanoscale design elements and the nanodevice-cell phenotype links. The tools will be open-sourced, helping to attract a global community of users employing the node's tools and a global community of developers enhancing them. By introducing enhancements to cyberinfrastructure capabilities in the Network for Computational Nanotechnology, the Engineered nanoBIO node will provide an overarching framework of integrated nanoBIO tools that will empower researchers to investigate macroscale biotransport and cell phenotype response to tweaks in the design of nanodevices. This will enable the development of metrics for nanodevice safety, intracellular stability, and nanodevice-based detection, imaging, and drug-delivery capabilities. "

This project is closely aligned with a long-standing interest of the National Science Foundation to increase the number of underrepresented faculty in the engineering and computing professoriate. By executing this project, the investigators expect that there will be an increase the number of Black engineering and social scientist faculty who are trained to serve as coaches and mentors for scholars from underrepresented groups at the crucial, pre-faculty career stage; increase in the number of diverse doctoral and postdoctoral scholars who become employed as engineering and computing faculty; and improvement of the success rate of Black engineering and computing faculty through the tenure process. As way of increasing the number of underrepresented groups who enter the engineering professoriate, the project's plan comprised the following: <br/><br/>(1) Developing effective materials for coaching-based mentorship of future engineering faculty.<br/>(2) Recruiting and training current tenured faculty in engineering and social science to serve as coaches <br/>(3) Implementing the coaching-based mentorship. <br/>(4) Implementing a plan to sustain the coaching-based mentorship beyond the project funding.<br/>(5) Implementing a plan to sustain the coaching-based mentorship beyond the project funding.<br/>(6) Coordinating and assessing the coaching-based mentorship. <br/><br/>Guided by the theoretical and scientific literature on Communities of Practice (CoP) and Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), the investigators outlined a comprehensive project to develop and implement a coaching-based mentoring program to enhance approaches to diversify the engineering and computing professoriate and to develop methods to teach and train tenured engineering and social science faculty effective mentoring skills. For this project, the investigators plan to extend this mentoring intervention to 40 underrepresented doctoral and postdoctoral scholars in engineering and computing, with a particular focus on those who are interested in pursuing faculty positions. Additionally, the plan includes the services of an external evaluator, who will execute multi-level, multi-phased, mixed methods data collections from all the key project stakeholders (e.g., coaches, mentees, postdoctoral manager, graduate students, and the investigators.

However, simply studying who matriculates and who graduates does not tell the complete story of a student's path through the engineering curriculum nor should it be used as a measure of an institution. A national, longitudinal student unit-record database would enable study of engineering programs and benchmark metrics consistently.  MIDFIELD has already been proven to facilitate data on student matriculation habits disaggregated across various engineering disciplines, ethnicities and genders.  However is value as a predictive tool has also been somewhat limited due to the small (eleven) number of institutions who have provided their student data.<br/><br/>This project will enable the expansion of the MIDFIELD database to include a total of 103 institutions. With input from university data managers, engineering education administrators, specialists in high volume data archiving and the community of researchers, this work will result in a database containing over 1.05 million students.  More specifically the data will represent over 50% of the U.S. engineering undergraduate degrees awarded and increase the diversity of institutions in the dataset.  MIDFIELD will now include public and private institutions, minority serving institutions, and institutions from a broad range of research classifications. The sheer scope and longitude of MIDFIELD will enable significant improvements in research in higher education. It will enable the development of research capacity to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity/gender/social class) and curricular pathways (including coursework) by institution and over time.  Furthermore, this project will utilize workshops as well as asynchronous training modules to educate the broader research community, expanding the network of researchers capable of conducting this research and the sharing of innovative research methods in addition to the actual data.

This program will highlight recent developments in neurotechnology for basic science research and healthcare. It is estimated that 100 million U.S. citizens will have a significant brain-related disorder in their lifetime.  There is a need to train scientists and engineers who will research and understand the process for translating neural systems engineering research into human applications. This site will focus on recruiting a diverse group of students with an emphasis on recruiting women, underrepresented minorities, and undergraduates from colleges where opportunities to pursue STEM-based research are opportunities.  <br/><br/>Over a three year period, this REU program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience aimed at further developing neurotechnology for brain imaging, decoding and modulation.  Projects will focus on developing technology, running simulations or data analysis.  Many of the projects will integrate multiple modalities of neurotechnology, such as multi-modal imaging, brain-computer interfaces and closed-loop neuromodulation.  Students will have opportunities to investigate neuronal dynamics, plasticity, learning and attention as feedback metrics to optimize neurotechnologies.  Research projects will provide opportunities for REU students to learn about large scale data analysis, computational modeling of the brain, and participate in experiments. The program will have group building projects to develop a cohesion between the students within the program and with their graduate student mentors to create lasting friendships and collaborations. The program will emphasize near-peer mentoring where the REU students will be directly mentored students in their second and third year of graduate school, and in turn will be offered the opportunity to meet and educate high school students about neural engineering.  To broaden their perspective, students will participate in a bi-weekly neuroengineering seminar series hosted in conjunction with a NSF IGERT program and the Center for Neuroengineering.  Multiple mechanisms will help guide students in their professional development and prepare them for graduate school.  To develop communication skills, students will participate in outreach programs and present their research in a small forum at the end of the program."

Calls from both disabilities studies and national organizations such as the American Institute for Research consistently ask educators to broaden participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math fields to include individuals with disabilities. Therefore, this work targets an urgent need in engineering education research. The study lays a foundation for broadening participation in engineering by enabling us to better understand the supports and barriers students with disabilities experience. Educators will be able to use the findings to develop inclusive educational experiences that promote identity formation, diversity, and universal design. At the same time, because the students will are followed into the workplace, the findings can benefit engineering employers as they hire engineers with disabilities, again focusing on systems and structures that support inclusion and accessibility. Moreover, the project will build bridges between the engineering education and disabilities studies community by establishing partnerships and bolstering ongoing conversations within engineering that help to move disability from the margins to the center.<br/><br/>The project addresses the call for studies on the ""development of identity as an engineer and its intersection with other identities"" by conducting a longitudinal study of students with disabilities in civil engineering. The project will use constructivist grounded theory to study two cohorts over three years. The first cohort follows 20 students from the fall of their first year through the spring of their junior year, with interviews twice a year (early fall and late spring). The second cohort, run concurrently, follows 20 students from spring of their junior year through their first year in the workplace, again with interviews twice a year. This approach spans the full undergraduate experience as well as the transition to work, and provides a rich data set from which to develop a theory of identity formation for this population. <br/><br/>Consistent with grounded theory, the project does not impose an existing theory on the data; however, the understanding of identity broadly draws on social identity theory (SIT), which treats identities in terms of group membership developed through comparisons of values and behaviors members make with one another and with individuals belonging to other groups. This approach is consistent with existing studies of individuals with disabilities in college as well as with studies of professional identities, and allows the project team to situate the work within the broader landscape of identity research in engineering. The project addresses a significant gap in research on the professional formation of engineers by extending an emergent theoretical model of identity development in civil engineering to students with disabilities as they advance through their degree program and into the workforce. It provides significant contributions to research on identity development in engineering broadly, research on diversity and inclusion in engineering, and research on disability studies in higher education - issues that, to date, have seen little integration. The longitudinal approach advances our understanding of undergraduate development by capturing both how and why individuals with disabilities merge and negotiate personal and professional identities through these changes over time. The model developed in this study can then be used by researchers in other engineering fields and, potentially, beyond engineering to facilitate a more robust and nuanced understanding of how students with disabilities develop identities in college."

Ubiquitous mobile computing on a global scale will demand low-cost, low-power computing devices delivering high data rates and high density data storage, form factor versatility, and access to long-lasting portable energy sources. The vision of the NASCENT Center is to establish a research, innovation and education ecosystem that will create the high-throughput, sustainable, reliable and versatile nanomanufacturing systems to revolutionize future generations of mobile computing and energy devices. The overall goals of the Center are to:<br/><br/>- Invent nanomanufacturing systems for nanosculpting and for integrating abundantly available nanomaterials, such as exfoliated silicon, graphene, carbon nanotubes and organic semiconductors.<br/>- Conceptualize and design these nanomanufacturing systems to address the practical requirements of future generation mobile computing and energy devices.<br/>- Foster a culture of innovation that seeks to commercially deploy Center technologies through industrial practitioner partners and start-up companies.<br/>- Educate highly skilled and diverse leaders imbued with the Innovator's DNA.<br/><br/>The Center will focus on five transformative high-speed nanomanufacturing systems and processes: 1) Nanosculpting; 2) Sustainable Semiconducting Material Processing; 3) Versatile Manufacturing for Mobile Device Form Factors; 4) Ink Jet Nanomaterial Deposition; and 5) Inline Nanometrology for Process Diagnostics and Control.<br/><br/>The barriers the Center will overcome include: (i) lack of machines and processable materials for high-speed, large-area, low-defectivity nanomanufacturing and for nanometrology; (ii) absence of device architectures that are tailored to exploit strengths of promising nanomanufacturing processes; (iii) lack of validated models with quantified uncertainty to extrapolate prototype system performance to commercial scale, and reduced order models for real-time diagnostics, and control of nanomanufacturing systems. The Center will marry advanced nanoscience research with novel nanomanufacturing systems to overcome these barriers and accelerate the design, development and deployment of versatile and innovative mobile computing devices.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the proposed research are the creation of revolutionary manufacturing, devices, materials and modeling, including: 1) machine system architectures based on nano-precision mechanics, dynamics and control, in-line optical metrology, and integration of novel nanomaterials for high-throughput, wafer-scale and roll-to-roll nanomanufacturing; 2) design and demonstration of multi-bit STT-RAM, THz transceivers, non-planar cameras and hybrid advanced displays; 3) synthesis and integration of a wide array of novel nanomaterials and processes, from block co-polymers for self-aligned memory to exfoliated films of Si nanowires for flexible and high power density batteries; and 4) creation of predictive multi-scale computational tools with quantified uncertainty for process modeling, scale-up and real-time control of large area, high-speed nanomanufacturing processes.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the Center is the development of critical nanomanufacturing infrastructure for mobile computing technologies which will impact, on a world-wide scale, all aspects of healthcare, education, commerce, communications, computing and lifestyle. These nanomanufacturing advances will help create sustainable high-paying jobs in the US and will be supported by innovative human resource development and entrepreneurship activities. The Center will create a pipeline of diverse students to enter STEM fields and become creative global nanomanufacturing leaders through an educational program that emphasizes development of the Innovator's DNA, strong mentorship, focused technical and entrepreneurial coursework, interdisciplinary research and close interactions with global and industrial nanomanufacturing leaders"

The need for advanced sensing and imaging technologies to enhance our nation's health, homeland, food and energy security has never been more urgent as evident from the NAE Grand Challenges.  Research in sensing and imaging technologies has an obvious societal impact that appeals to a broad demographic of students. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of the research, which merges engineering concepts with those in the sciences will help attract students from all engineering and non-engineering disciplines.

As a result of this persistent underrepresentation, Latinx K-12 students lack role models with careers in these fields -- especially in engineering. In addition, sometimes engineering in K-12 education is not presented in a way that excites the interests of students from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Having full representation from all groups that make up the rich and diverse talent in the U.S. is crucial to reach our full potential for advancement in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is important to understand how all students can be encouraged to pursue STEM degrees, particularly Latinx students in middle school. The purpose of this project is to explore how teachers, as immediate role models, can serve as mediators and agents of positive change for Latinx middle school students. Teachers can become agents of positive change when they learn how to integrate the knowledge, skills and experiences (also known as ""funds of knowledge"") that students bring into the classroom to engineering content. It is important for teachers to understand how engineering connects with the realities of Latinx students' lived experiences at home and at their communities to provide students with better opportunities to engage in engineering. This study seeks to build teacher capacity to help students link these in-school and out-of-school experiences. Doing so provides a foundation for students to get excited and feel empowered to become future engineers. By building a more inclusive learning environment for engineering education, teachers of K-12 students, including their Latinx students, can contribute to diversifying and increasing the numbers of students prepared to pursue careers in engineering.<br/><br/>Currently, there is little research around how to develop teachers' capacity to integrate funds of knowledge with engineering, or the impact of such integration on students. The goal of this project, therefore, is (1) to explore how and to what extent the integration of funds of knowledge with engineering design can facilitate Latinx students' interest in engineering, and (2) how to develop teachers' capacities for activating and acknowledging students' funds of knowledge. The project focuses on middle school students and teachers in a predominantly Latinx area in the U.S.-Mexico border with a high ELL population. It (1) offers teachers the opportunities, structure, and support to recognize, value, and activate Latinx students' funds of knowledge in relation to engineering; and (2) creates a structure and culture that helps Latinx students cultivate their own awareness of their funds of knowledge, as well as their interest in and knowledge of engineering. The sample includes eight middle school mathematics and science teachers, and one engineering teacher. Each teacher is expected to contribute to the development and implementation of curricula that integrate funds of knowledge in engineering contexts with at least one class of 25 students, totaling 225 students per year of implementation. This mixed methods study uses data from observations, interviews, digital logs, focus groups, artifacts and surveys, as well as both quantitative and qualitative analyses methods, to study how the integration of funds of knowledge and engineering occurs. The study addresses the need to promote a more equitable formation of engineers where diverse voices are acknowledged. Thus, the knowledge generated in this study is essential for creating future engineers and culturally responsive teachers. Most importantly, this study explores what teachers and schools can do to support engineering learning, excite students, and motivate them to become outstanding, creative, and productive engineers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve these, the program will feature: formal training, workshops, and supplemental activities in the conduct of research in academia and industry; innovative research experience through engagement in projects with scientific and practical merits in both academic and industrial environments; experience in conducting laboratory experiments; and opportunities to present the research outcomes to the broader community at professional settings. The joint efforts among two institutions and industry partners provide the project team with extensive access to valuable resources, such as expertise to offer a wider-range of informative training workshops, advanced equipment, valuable data sets, experienced undergraduate mentors, and professional connections, that will facilitate a meaningful REU experience. Recruitment of REU participants will target 20 collaborating minority and primarily undergraduate institutions (15 of them are Hispanic-Serving Institutions) with limited STEM research capabilities."

Despite numerous clinical trials and growing industry commitment, no concerted effort has been made to enable scalable manufacturing of therapeutic cells as an effective, safe, reproducible, and affordable product with standardized characterization, and quality control. This has hindered broad translation of cell therapies into clinical and industrial practice. To overcome this, the engineering community must develop new tools and technologies to reproducibly manufacture high-quality cells at large-scale and low-cost; enable robust supply-chain, storage, and distribution logistics; and train a diverse cell-manufacturing workforce. The proposed ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT) is a national, comprehensive, convergence-science effort where engineers will work closely with industry partners, clinicians, biologists, workforce experts, as well as standards and regulatory agencies to transform the production of therapeutic cells into a large-scale, low-cost, reproducible, and high-quality engineered manufacturing process. Georgia Tech is the lead university of CMaT. The University of Georgia, University of Wisconsin ? Madison, and University of Puerto Rico ? Mayaguez are major partners, alongside several affiliate institutions. CMaT will have broad and lasting societal impact: producing new fundamental knowledge and transformative technologies, building an inclusive workforce, nurturing a nascent industry, and improving healthcare. It will be an internationally recognized exemplar center with state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, an embedded culture of innovation and inclusion, and will engage deeply and broadly in education and workforce development through a comprehensive program involving under-represented students and teachers from high schools, students with disabilities, veterans, technical and community college students, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The CMaT team recently led the development of an industry-driven, 10-year national roadmap for cell manufacturing that provides a prioritized pathway for critical technology development. CMaT will be a natural venue for implementing this roadmap. Scalable manufacturing of high-quality therapeutic cells poses complex challenges, different from those currently experienced by industry. First, the product is a ""living"" entity whose properties can change with every manipulation requiring a whole new paradigm for large-scale manufacturing and quality-control. Second, little is known about the Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) of therapeutic cells, i.e. measurable biomarkers that render them safe and effective for specific disease indications in patients and how to measure them. Third, little standardization exists across the field. Thus, Quality-by-Design (QbD), a fundamental premise of current manufacturing practice, has not been implemented in cell manufacturing. To enable these, CMaT will innovate transformative tools, technologies, and methods using three Engineered Systems (Test-Beds): (a) Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cells for immune-modulation and musculoskeletal regeneration, (b) T cell immunotherapies for cancer, and (c) induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived cardiac cells to treat heart diseases. In each of these systems CMaT will develop (a) new omics-based tools that couple big-data analytics and modeling to identify CQAs for safety and efficacy prediction; (b) novel cell-process sensors to measure quality attributes, both at the initial starting point and throughout the manufacturing process, and ensure well-defined, reproducible and high quality cells for therapy; (c) new scale-up and scale-out technologies with integrated quality control; (d) efficient cell purification and separation technologies that maintain cell purity, yield, and quality; (e) high throughput methods for rapidly validating function, potency and safety of manufactured cells; and (f) critical industrial-design principles, automated closed-system manufacturing, and supply-chain modeling to lower cost, ensure reproducibility, and enable scalable production."

Reflection is closely linked to metacognitive skill, or the ability to think about one's thinking processes and independently guide one's own learning during new tasks. It is widely accepted by the education community that students who reflect and develop strong metacognitive skills often become better students, learners, and professionals, since they obtain the ability to identify what they don't know (but need to learn) and how they can acquire knowledge for improvement. These are lifelong learning skills that enable self-management of necessary learning during one's career. Despite being closely linked to lifelong learning outcomes, reflection and metacognition are not skills that are regularly cultivated or practiced in the engineering education curriculum. Thus, prominent education scholars have called for more reflection and metacognition within the curriculum as well as publication of classroom studies involving their use. The problem to be addressed by this research is the development and propagation of a new method for cultivating metacognitive skills in engineering students by combining questions that promote reflective thought with computer-aided simulation tools for electronic-circuit building that can be used for problem exploration. During homework and after quizzes and exams, students will use the simulator to discover gaps in their learning and understanding of electronic circuits. Beyond the electrical and computer engineering classroom, the techniques are broadly applicable to other engineering disciplines since each has complex problems for which simulation tools are used. The impact of incorporating simulation tools within the reflective process will be studied, and the findings will contribute to the promotion of needed reflective and metacognitive practices in science, engineering, technology, and math (STEM), which will prepare students for the challenges of professional practice, for which lifelong learning skills are needed.<br/><br/>This research aims to determine the impact of systematic, frequent reflection - using SPICE simulation with homework or after exams - on the professional formation of engineers with respect to metacognitive, reflective, and technical performance outcomes. SPICE is the de facto standard simulation environment used by professionals to predict electronic circuit behavior. This work is informed by Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory and Schons Theory of the Reflective Practitioner, which rely on ""doing"" as well as ""reflecting on the doing"" for one's learning. The key research questions are: 1) To what extent does systematic, frequent reflection, particularly involving the use of simulation, enhance students' reflective practices and technical course performance? 2) Why and how does this occur? Outcomes will be investigated for all students as well as specific demographics, including females and under-represented minorities. The research questions will be investigated by comparing the depth and content of students' reflections as well as course performance metrics under different amounts of reflective activity within the course. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative research methods will be used, in particular double-coded content analysis of reflections and analysis-of-variance statistical techniques using baseline course performance data. Student perspectives on the impact of reflection will be assessed through interviews, focus groups, and surveys. This research aims to respond to recent calls from the literature and prominent educators for: 1) formal inclusion of metacognitive skill development within the curriculum, and 2) additional scholarly publications on reflection in engineering education to propagate these skills, which support lifelong, self-regulated learning for demanding professional practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, many leaders in industry report that the professional skills of these students are not strong enough. Therefore, colleges and universities are looking for new ways to strengthen these skills. Adding additional course content to existing courses or creating new courses to teach this content is often not feasible due to already crowded curricula. Outside of courses, one opportunity for undergraduates in technical fields to learn professional skills is through outreach activities. In these activities, undergraduates reach out to younger students in elementary, middle, and high schools and communicate what occurs in their respective fields. For example, outreach could include hosting a summer camp for middle school students on robotics or visiting a high school to give an electrical engineering demonstration. Not only do undergraduates receive training for these outreach activities, but they have the opportunity to practice what was learned multiple times. Recently, one outreach program, the Engineering Ambassadors Network, discovered that one of their particular training-and-practice sequences led the participating undergraduates to dramatically improve their presentation skills. Because scores of outreach programs exist around the country, the question arises: Do other outreach programs have training-and-practice sequences that lead undergraduates to greatly improve other professional skills?<br/><br/>This project seeks to determine which outreach programs in the United States provide the most transformative professional development of the participating undergraduates from engineering. To accomplish this goal, we have identified four tasks: (i) perform a systematic review of existing outreach programs involving engineering undergraduates; (ii) convene a workshop with outreach advisors to establish a network and thematic strands of common practices; (iii) synthesize the data obtained from the workshops to identify transformative practices of professional development; and (iv) convene two national training workshops to disseminate the practices to engineering undergraduates who perform outreach. An advisory board, composed of a number of stakeholders, provides guidance for this project. To disseminate the project's results, we are using a number of venues and a range of communication methods.  In particular, we are targeting the many programs that conduct organized outreach performed by engineering undergraduates.  Specifically, dissemination is occurring through the two national workshops mentioned above, academic papers, an online report targeting a wide audience, and online tutorials for the transformative practices of professional development."

In order to ensure a diverse applicant body, recruitment efforts will be focused on HBCU's, women's colleges, institutions for individuals with disabilities, and institutions with less than very high research capabilities (i.e. community colleges, liberal arts colleges). This REU Site has the potential to engage students in the quest to address one of the key challenges of the 21st century: improving the quality of health care while making it more accessible and affordable. In addition, this REU Site will help create a more diverse workforce in science and engineering, providing women, underrepresented minority students, and persons with disabilities formative research experiences and connecting them to the social and professional networks as pathways for careers in these fields. The Wireless Health REU Site will expand the students' scientific knowledge and, more generally, teach students how to frame problems, design experiments, work collaboratively, make observations, draw appropriate conclusions, and communicate their results to others.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The Wireless Health REU Site, with support from NSF's Division of Engineering Education and Centers, will host ten rising second and third year undergraduate students at the University of Virginia for an intensive eight-week research program focused on the interdisciplinary field of wireless technologies for health applications.  Drawing on advances in wireless networks, integrated circuits, sensing, signal processing, communications, data mining, and databases, Wireless Health technologies will enable continuous, longitudinal, remote monitoring for health and wellness applications, ranging from early disease diagnosis and aging-in-place support to chronic care and general wellness management. REU participants will participate in multi-platform learning, including online coursework and a lab skills ""bootcamp"", before they engage in cutting edge research projects designed and actively-mentored by faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate student mentors. Over the three years, students will work collectively to develop a body sensor network testbed that spans technology from lower-level device designs to higher-level networking protocols. Projects will be coordinated with overarching yearly themes to build cohort cohesion and allow for more sophisticated collaborations as follows: Year 1- Home Health Monitoring Systems; Year 2- Smartphone Based Sensors; and Year 3- Health Related Behavior Modifications. In addition to research activities, undergraduate participants will take part in a professional development series, journal club, and field trips to areas where wireless health technologies are being developed and used in the real world. The culmination of this experience is a symposium where each student presents oral and poster presentations of his or her research findings. This REU aims to provide a cohesive research and career enhancement experience for students at a strategic point in their undergraduate careers in order to develop a more diversified and prepared for 21st century engineering workforce."

Its impacts, which are felt coast-to-coast and around the world, include noxious algal blooms in streams, rivers and the coastal ocean, ocean hypoxia and acidification, loss of inland and coastal fisheries, and the production of potent greenhouse gases that disproportionately contribute to an increase in temperature in the environment. The ?Three R?s? for mitigating aquatic nutrient pollution are: Reduction: decrease nutrient released during the production of energy (N) and food (N and P); Removal: retain P and denitrify bioavailable N to N2 gas following its creation and use; and Recovery: capture and reuse N and P from waste streams. Environmental engineers have made great strides in developing treatment systems for the removal and recovery of nutrients from waste streams. The next frontier lies in optimizing networks of treatment systems at the watershed-to-continental scale while taking into account: (1) all three R?s (not just removal and recovery); (2) natural attenuation by terrestrial vegetation, wetlands, and stream corridors (i.e., the stream and associated riparian and hyporheic zones); and (3) the non-linear responses of ecosystems to nutrient loading. In this grant we will carry out planning exercises and three workshops with the goal of developing a Convergent Engineering Research Center (C-ERC) to address these grand challenges. Our NSF C-ERC will be founded on a computational platform (GEN-2) that brings together engineers, hydrologists, oceanographers, ecologists, economists, political scientists, education experts, and a broad cross-section of stakeholders, in pursuit of practical solutions to nutrient pollution at continental-to-global scales.<br/><br/>Through planning exercises and three workshops we will select and refine our: (1) team of scholars, learners, and stakeholders; (2) research questions and approaches; (3) educational and outreach activities; (4) leadership structure and analytical tools needed to promote deep collaboration among team members; (5) approach for ensuring that engineering education and under-represented minority recruitment/inclusion is ?in the DNA? of everything we do; and (6) analytical tools for assessing the Center?s impact. Our planning products will be informed by boundary organization theory, and co-produced by a diverse group of highly qualified scholars (including 23 researchers across 11 universities and three countries) working in four complementary teams. The Watershed Team will develop GEN-2 and assure that it seamlessly integrates with other continental-scale modeling frameworks, assimilates real-time and historical data, and advances the design of next generation water quality observational networks. The Ocean Team will utilize existing regional ocean models to evaluate the relative importance of land-based nutrient sources and natural oceanographic processes (such as nutrient upwelling) on coastal ocean water quality. The Policy Team will evaluate possible solutions to nutrient pollution through the lens of cost-benefit analysis, behavioral economics (using randomized trials to evaluate the long-term efficacy of proposed interventions), and political science (using case studies to uncover governance innovations likely to facilitate management transitions). Finally, the Society Team will utilize NSF I-Corps principles to elucidate goals and ?pain points? of stakeholders and foster an inclusive ecosystem of learners, scholars, and stakeholders that reflects the demographic make-up of the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has maintained great interest in activities that promote broadening participation among underrepresented groups. To increase participation in engineering, new knowledge must be generated on how best to broadening participation at every juncture of the educational pipeline, including the K-12 level. Very little, if any, research has investigated the factors that influence broadening participation among rural, underrepresented students within the K-12  educational enterprise. In the southern region of the United States, the Alabama Black Belt bears an uneven burden of poverty, where many low income and underrepresented groups are disproportionately affected. With this in mind, the investigators proposed to collect multiple levels of data across 15 school districts in the Black Belt region to pinpoint educational barriers and create action plans that can mitigate and/or eliminate these educational obstacles for rural underrepresented students. This project will likely have a tremendous impact on the engineering workforce in the Black Belt region and beyond. <br/><br/>Using Social Cognitive Career Theory as the theoretical framework, the investigators outlined a comprehensive project to study the issues often associated with low income students and underrepresented students entering the engineering enterprise and determine the educational challenges that they experience with pursuing engineering. Because of the cross-cutting nature of the project, a multi-disciplinary research team, composed of engineers, scientists, education faculty, and research staff, will be formed to execute this comprehensive study. Additionally, advisory committees, representing local, state, and federal interests, will be created to help promote the project and ensure its success with identifying the educational challenges and recommending specific strategies to address the identified challenges."

The educational goals of this REU will be accomplished through a multidisciplinary approach using simulations, imaging, and modeling as a common thread. The popularity of computational research models has increased due to limited use of human subjects and animals.  Furthermore, as the trend towards personalized medicine spurs the development and refinement of models across scales from cells, to organs, to entire systems, multiscale modeling is becoming integrated into clinical decision support. Exposing REU students to innovative research will increase their awareness about graduate school and ultimately increase the STEM graduate school pipeline. The proposed REU program will also strengthen their STEM career paths and increase student's identities as scientists or engineers, and improve their communication skills. The student research projects have the potential to substantially improve the development of models in biomedical engineering which will reduce reliance on human and animal data, and expedite innovation. These models will have many different applications, for example: calculating loads acting on the human body during movement, simulating tasks that cannot safely be performed by experimental subjects, and simulating blood flow through vessels. Additional benefits from this program include improved connections to faculty at ECU partner institutions. Through the REU program students will be exposed to cutting edge research utilizing advanced computational models with applications in biomedical engineering.<br/><br/>The goal of the BME-SIM program is to provide a quality research experience to students, especially those who have limited opportunities for research at their home institution or come from groups underrepresented in science and engineering. At the end of the program students should have a better understanding of how to conduct research, increased awareness of graduate school, clarification and reinforcement of STEM career path, and greater identification as engineer/scientist. Additionally, a new focus of this program will provide training to improve students' communication skills. To achieve these program goals participants will be engaged for longer than the 10 week summer research experience by collaborating with home institution mentors. To ensure a broad applicant pool, student recruitment will begin at ECU partner institutions which include several regional HBCUs and community colleges which serve underrepresented minority, veteran and low-socioeconomic status student populations. Graduates of the program will gain a better understanding of graduate school and be competitive in the graduate school application process increasing diversity in the STEM pipeline."

Automotive technology provides an attractive and excellent area for learning about research because of its importance to everyday life and it often involves the broad integration of many fields, including mechanical engineering, mechatronics, computer science, and collaborative engineering. This program will leverage a strong, ongoing partnership between VT and TUD that includes joint research, team-teaching courses, BSME senior-year abroad programs, and dual-BSME and dual-MSME degree programs, to provide the REU students with firsthand experience demonstrating the globalization of the engineering profession and the importance of collaborative engineering. The program will also provide US industry and government agencies with future employees that are internationally competitive, globally engaged, and comfortable with and experienced at operating overseas, and contribute data towards the development of a predictive model that best matches an individual student with the most effective mode of global exposure, for the benefit of future international REU programs.<br/><br/>During this 10-week summer program diverse and talented cohorts of undergraduates, from institutions with limited or no research and international opportunities will be provided with the opportunity to practice global engineering research at either VT or TUD. This program will also enhance and broaden the interface of the transatlantic faculty and student collaborations as the mentoring research teams collaborate with their REU students engaged in joint transatlantic research projects, and as the REU students transition their research from VT one summer to TUD the subsequent summer. In addition to their research, and to facilitate a transatlantic cohort experience, the students participate in a weekly seminar series focusing on best research practices, ethics, cultural differences, and globalization.  The students will utilize training resources in globalHUB, an NSF Engineering Virtual Organization. At the end of the summer, the students will present their work at a conference via live-two-way video between the two REU locations. An emphasis will be placed on engaging the REU students and their home institution advisors, upon their return home, to increase their co-authorship of publications resulting from their research activities, and 2) their pursuit of graduate studies."

The proposed Center for Additive Food Manufacturing Technologies (CAFMT) is a comprehensive, pre-competitive, public-private partnership that will create fundamental technologies for the 21st-century food manufacturing industry. New technologies will enable America's food manufacturing industry to transition from its outdated centralized food manufacturing model to a more futuristic decentralized, localized manufacturing network (DLFM) model. DLFM is an emerging food manufacturing network model favored by emerging consumers as it is based on localized food manufacturing with very short distribution chains taking advantage of local sourcing and providing highly desirable fresh foods. <br/><br/>The proposed ERC will create the new food manufacturing model through the convergence of the advantages of additive manufacturing (3D ""printing"") of foodstuff with natural structures and texture, automation and robotics, micro/nanotechnologies, (bio)sensing, biomaterials, data integration platforms and internet based processes. New breakthroughs established under CAFMT will utilize raw materials more efficiently, reduce food waste by shortening the long distribution chains and provide nutritious food all consumers, even those in current urban food deserts. Ultimately, the CAFMT approach will advance American manufacturing competitiveness, reduce water and energy demands, and feed a growing global population using local food materials. The broader impact of the ERC will be increasing science literacy and engagement among the consuming public with the planning process used to identify education/intervention activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, the curricula that engineering students encounter at many engineering colleges and universities do not provide sufficient education in the area of sociotechnical thinking. In this project, the research team builds on prior research to extend sociotechnical education into additional classrooms at two universities to better understand how students learn to think sociotechnically. The results from the two new courses, one each in electrical and mechanical engineering, will be compared to those from the original research project to better understand barriers and opportunities for such educational practices in this broader context. The three primary project goals are: 1) to increase understanding of the processes by which students develop their abilities to engineer sociotechnically; 2) to advance understanding of how sociotechnical thinking impacts engineering habits of mind, including specific engineering values, attitudes, and skills; and 3) to increase understanding of the transferability of sociotechnical integration methods between courses and institutions. Key contributions include the creation of new understandings of the process by which students learn to think sociotechnically and assessment of the transferability of teaching elements and results from one course and instructor to two others. An estimated 1000 students over three years will benefit from new skills, and undergraduate research assistants will further learn how to conduct engineering education research. <br/> <br/>This research builds upon an earlier grant to examine the processes by which students acquire sociotechnical thinking in mechanical and electrical engineering courses and the impacts of sociotechnical integration on their engineering habits of mind. Data will be collected and analyzed from pre- and post-assessments, assignments, focus groups, and faculty reflection logs over the course of three years. The intellectual merit of the research centers on the creation of new understandings of processes by which students form sociotechnical engineering attitudes and skills, using triangulation via a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to increase validity. The plan to assess transferability to different classes and universities represents a significant new contribution compared to prior research. In terms of broader impacts, by better understanding how approximately 1000 students over three years form, struggle with, and benefit from sociotechnical thinking, the research can identify the means by which diverse students acquire sociotechnical engineering attributes that align with professional practice. The research will also identify specific mechanisms of transferability to guide sociotechnical learning across engineering education. The diverse research team will learn from each other, improving collective understanding of how students develop sociotechnical thinking. A long-term impact is to inspire broader innovations in sociotechnical engineering within engineering science core courses and thereby to disrupt the artificial divide that prioritizes techno-centric thinking within engineering education."

Research has suggested the United States workforce may suffer a deficit of one million STEM graduates over the next decade. Annually, less than half of the three million students who enter U.S. colleges intending to major in a STEM field persist in STEM until graduation. The situation is worse among groups (i.e., African American, Hispanic, and Native American) traditionally underrepresented in STEM. For example, in engineering, underrepresented groups account for just 16% of all undergraduate students; those who decided to major in engineering switch to non-STEM fields before graduation twice as often as White students. The representation of Black males particularly continues to be a challenge. Each year, about 64% of White males earn a bachelor's degree in engineering, compared to about 5% of African American males. At the graduate level, Black males only account for 3% and 1.7% of STEM master's and doctoral degrees, respectively. Moreover, Black males account for 3.6% of the engineering workforce and a dismal 2.5% of engineering faculty. This collaborative research focuses on understanding the factors that influence the decisions of Black males to pursue advanced engineering degrees, uncovering the assets/strengths that Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond the baccalaureate degree, and determining the role of academic self-concept and engineering identity in the intent to pursue advanced engineering degrees. This study includes Black male engineering students, advanced degree holders and faculty from a Predominantly White Institution (University of Connecticut), a Hispanic-serving institution (University of Houston), a Historically Black University (Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical University) and from members of the National Society of Black Engineers. <br/><br/>This project pursues three research questions: 1) What factors influenced Black males to pursue graduate degrees in engineering? 2) What assets/strengths do Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond undergraduate studies? 3) What role does academic self-concept and engineering identity play in the intent to pursue advanced degrees among Black males? To answer these questions, the project employs a mixed-method approach. Data sources include formal semi-structured interviews and surveys. This project uniquely contributes to research literature on cultural capital, anti-deficit achievement, and engineering identity work. The evaluation uses a values-engaged, educative approach. This work stands to influence the recruitment and retention of engineering graduate students and give insight into creating a pipeline for Black male engineering faculty. This work will be leveraged to create a national Black male engineering colloquium devoted to sharing relevant research along with career development and graduate school opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many believe that these findings are connected, at least in part, to the emphasis on direct instruction that persists in many American urban high schools today. This project, based in an urban public high school, aims to support teachers as they move from direct instruction, which stresses content-based learning and rote memorization, to authentic learning, which focuses on project-based approaches and engineering literacies. During the grant period, we will observe classroom practice, create teacher inquiry groups, and conduct semi-structured interviews with teachers and students to understand the effects of this pedagogical shift on classroom learning and student outcomes. The project will demonstrate the instructional practices and pathways that are most likely to increase academic outcomes and college placement, which will ultimately create a more diverse group of individuals with the skills, literacies, and competencies to pursue careers in engineering.    <br/><br/>This project seeks to validate that authentic learning is directly tied to college placement and success in engineering careers and seeks to explore the reactions among the students and teachers who are committed to moving their curricular and pedagogical approaches from direct instruction to authentic learning. Through a mixed-methods approach that combines classroom observations, student/teacher interviews, textual analysis of student work, and analysis of student-level data, the study will examine the ways that teachers and students react to these instructional changes, and how these shifts affect students' academic outcomes and diversify the pathways to and through engineering. The research will have broad implications to understanding and replicating instructional practices and learning processes that best prepare urban youth of color for postsecondary success and engineering careers by fundamentally restructuring the way that instruction is delivered. It will leverage the Next Generation Science Standards and the Engineering Habits of Mind to explore the development of engineering literacies. The findings from this study will generate a framework for understanding school reform and instructional change that takes into account teacher and student identities and perspectives, and outline the most promising ways for urban public high schools to increase academic engagement, engineering competencies, and college persistence among youth of color."

One example of service learning is Engineers Without Borders (EWB) USA, which seeks to find practical solutions to community concerns, such as clean water or sustainable sewage systems. Many universities and colleges offer such experiences to their students and believe they are contributing a valuable service to developing communities. However, service learning projects are often compromised because students graduate, and/or faculty leaders move to other institutions, and community ties are lost. The project seeks to find best practices for university/college-based service learning for all stakeholders in these enterprises.  This project is a collaboration between Engineers Without Borders USA and University of Wisconsin-Stout researchers, teachers, and students. The project will unfold over four years and includes both engineering and social science students in the work. Student attitudes, beliefs, and goals about community involvement are explored in a cross-institutional way: In addition to studying the UW-Stout EWB chapter, the project looks at data collected by Engineers Without Borders USA, and examines trends and practices throughout chapter projects.  <br/><br/>A wider understanding of how to balance the needs of students and communities could be broadly applied to service learning projects outside of the STEM fields. More specifically, community development, economic development, and applied anthropology projects might benefit from this research. Finally, third party stake holders such as employers of STEM students are able to employ students who are better prepared to operate in the global workplace due to their participation in well-formed service learning opportunities. In summary, This work contributes to the development of an economically competitive STEM workforce by providing a guiding structure for effective and ethical service learning initiatives for STEM education. The overall project outcomes are disseminated publicly through a project website, traditional and lay publications and presentations, and the development and delivery of workshops. Further, project outcomes that specifically target the operation of EWB-USA projects are incorporated into the guidelines that are followed by EWB-USA's membership, which includes more than 14,000 individuals."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>A warmer and drier climate has supplied abundant fuel (e.g., dry brush) for wildfires, drastically increasing fire activity across much of western North America in the past decades. Wildfires burn through forests, shrublands, and grasslands, leaving marked societal and environmental scars. Wildfire impacts are not limited to the burned area or the short term, instead extending beyond the burn region and over the long term, e.g., health-related issues due to wildfire smoke reaching across state and national borders. The targeted societal and environmental impacts of this project range from the safety, well-being, and physical and psychological health of society to the safety and well-being of ecosystems at all scales, from microbial to global. The impacts can be direct and immediate, such as fatalities and injuries, or indirect and long-term, such as the financial burden on public and private entities and the health effect of pollution due to widespread smoke and contamination of groundwater by acidic rain or fire retardants. The proposed vision is to plan and establish an engineering research center (ERC), FIRE (fire, impacts, remediation, education), by a diverse team that will use a convergent approach and strategy to reach objectives of: (i) identifying the complex relation between wildfires and their broad, direct and indirect, short- and long-term impacts on the society and environment; (ii) identifying expertise necessary to study these impacts; (iii) identifying various stakeholders impacted by or impacting wildfires; (iv) establishing a continuous communication channel with these stakeholders; and (v) creating a strategic plan for the formation of a team of experts and stakeholders to ultimately find innovative and cost-effective ways to mitigate the problem, remediate and restore the environment after wildfires, and educate the public to help the mitigation and ensure their safety during and after wildfires. <br/><br/>The grant activities include a kick-off meeting at Boise State, literature review, regular meetings and interviews with identified stakeholders to learn about impacts and other stakeholders, a major five-part workshop, reaching out to and attracting experts to fill gaps in the team's expertise, visiting up to a total of 12 ERCs to learn from successful ERC leaders, a series of physical and weekly cyber team-meetings, preparing initial drafts of an ERC proposal, two rounds of review, and revision of the ERC proposal.  As mentioned, a major activity of the project is a five-part workshop held at Boise State where ERC leaders, national and local experts and community leaders, representatives from state and federal agencies, members of the insurance industry, and leading scientists and entrepreneurs will train the team and a larger group of researchers on developing successful proposals for and running sustainable ERCs; communication with and engaging stakeholders and educating the public; enhancing a culture of inclusion and diversity; and the science and various other aspects of wildfires, their impacts, and impact mitigation. The project will also leverage the PIs' past collaboration with diversity institutions and inclusion of an associate director for diversity into the team to enhance the culture of inclusion, diversity, and sustainability within the ERC team throughout the planning grant, subsequent ERC, academic/professional communities, and society. We will work toward improved involvement of and communication with the public and private stakeholders (i.e., parties impacted by or impacting wildfires, including national and state agencies such as the Forest Services and Bureau of Land Management, policymakers, and leaders of communities and industries at high risk of wildfire) and prepare a well-thought proposal for a sustainable ERC that will ultimately help mitigate wildfires' negative impacts. The strategy to make this possible is understanding the complex fire-weather relations and impacts, developing data-driven predictive fire characteristic models, and educating the public to help prevent human-ignited wildfires and ensure public safety during wildfires and avoid harm from short- and long-term impacts. There will also be a focus on team and capacity building necessary to reach the above-mentioned goals via the proposed strategies. To better implement these steps via planning and developing the proposed ERC, the team will learn from prior ERCs across the United States and leverage their experience to design a sustainable ERC better adapted to new ERC requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pursuing science at the streetscape is challenging: it pits our scientific understanding against the messy complexity of human action and interaction, at scales of space, time, and impact that often outstrip our experimental ability to provide supporting data and analysis. This ERC will examine how to develop a deep understanding of the local streetscape needs and experiences amid all of the hustle and bustle that implies. This information will then be used to identify how that understanding can be quickly applied to large-scale smart city infrastructure. Improvements in infrastructure can be leveraged to return services at local scale to different users with locality-defined specificity. The initial planning grant activities will focus on a newly awarded NSF Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) testbed entitled ?COSMOS? (Cloud-Enhanced Open Software-Defined ?Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment) in an area of 1 sq mile in West Harlem (New York City). COSMOS examines how to fill-in critical gaps in smart city services along the streetscape, where individual people experience technology and the urban environment in often surprising ways that fall beyond the reach of current-generation smart city technology. Using the planning grant, the team will expand that reach beyond the Harlem testbed to other cities, as well as to rural settings.<br/><br/>This ERC planning efforts will explore how future generation wireless networks, combined with cutting-edge computing, may improve the life and landscape of local communities at the street level. It will focus on smart city functionality at very local scales in five applied thematic areas: The future of retailing, particularly cashier-less retail; Road safety, focused primarily at the interface between vehicles, streets, intersections, and crossing behavior of children and the elderly; Ethical security in public spaces, particularly benefits and privacy pitfalls of remote monitoring of individual and crowd flow on streets and around sensitive facilities; Last-meter logistics, especially interim dynamics between existing delivery and loading logistics and forthcoming autonomous logistics at the street-side; and The future of outdoor work, especially work performed on and around streets by city workers such as police and emergency service providers, as well as traffic control, maintenance and construction crews, utilities, and sanitation providers.  The potential for highly interactive real-time applications for individuals at the very local scale is profound for the five thematic areas already identified.

The U.S. is just starting to develop this resource, does not yet have an industrial supply chain for OWE, and there are unique U.S. challenges because of hurricanes, complex seabed conditions, and grid integration. In order to address these challenges, and to design resilient and cost-effective heavy OWE infrastructure (e.g., structures, transmission system), a convergent approach is needed. Failure for the U.S. to take this approach, to plan accordingly, to maximize continuous learning, and to take disruption actions when needed, would be a hugely missed opportunity for society to benefit from the breadth of U.S. expertise and knowhow, and to make technological advancements that have broad applications. <br/><br/>This ERC planning grant project will bring together those with relevant expertise in OWE from several engineering disciplines, fields of science, the national laboratories, state and federal resource management agencies, industrial stakeholders, and developers; as well as those from affected coastal communities. This group will design a data-driven multi-disciplinary system-level framework that identifies where advances are needed to build a resilient infrastructure (blades, turbine, support structure, transmission grid, standards, and models) that would enable a large and responsible level of OWE to be harvested. The technical areas to be integrated together in this frame will include but are not limited to metocean characterization (wind, waves, currents), composite materials, aerodynamic modeling, geo-engineering parameters, stability, fatigue, corrosion, inspection, control, renewable energy integration, social acceptance of OWE development, and impact on marine and coastal ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has suggested the United States workforce may suffer a deficit of one million STEM graduates over the next decade. Annually, less than half of the three million students who enter U.S. colleges intending to major in a STEM field persist in STEM until graduation. The situation is worse among groups (i.e., African American, Hispanic, and Native American) traditionally underrepresented in STEM. For example, in engineering, underrepresented groups account for just 16% of all undergraduate students; those who decided to major in engineering switch to non-STEM fields before graduation twice as often as White students. The representation of Black males particularly continues to be a challenge. Each year, about 64% of White males earn a bachelor's degree in engineering, compared to about 5% of African American males. At the graduate level, Black males only account for 3% and 1.7% of STEM master's and doctoral degrees, respectively. Moreover, Black males account for 3.6% of the engineering workforce and a dismal 2.5% of engineering faculty. This collaborative research focuses on understanding the factors that influence the decisions of Black males to pursue advanced engineering degrees, uncovering the assets/strengths that Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond the baccalaureate degree, and determining the role of academic self-concept and engineering identity in the intent to pursue advanced engineering degrees. This study includes Black male engineering students, advanced degree holders and faculty from a Predominantly White Institution (University of Connecticut), a Hispanic-serving institution (University of Houston), a Historically Black University (Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical University) and from members of the National Society of Black Engineers. <br/><br/>This project pursues three research questions: 1) What factors influenced Black males to pursue graduate degrees in engineering? 2) What assets/strengths do Black males possess who persist or plan to continue in engineering beyond undergraduate studies? 3) What role does academic self-concept and engineering identity play in the intent to pursue advanced degrees among Black males? To answer these questions, the project employs a mixed-method approach. Data sources include formal semi-structured interviews and surveys. This project uniquely contributes to research literature on cultural capital, anti-deficit achievement, and engineering identity work. The evaluation uses a values-engaged, educative approach. This work stands to influence the recruitment and retention of engineering graduate students and give insight into creating a pipeline for Black male engineering faculty. This work will be leveraged to create a national Black male engineering colloquium devoted to sharing relevant research along with career development and graduate school opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Innovation is limited when resources are untapped. Throughout the United States, there is a great demand for engineers and scientists who are well-trained and well-equipped for today's STEM workforce, including the engineering professoriate. This project seeks to design, implement, and study a faculty development program that addresses two major factors influencing student retention: (a) reducing the ""chilly climate"" that underrepresented engineering students' experience and (b) increasing active learning opportunities in the engineering classroom. Through the use of specialized readings, workshops, and small group discussions and activities, participating engineering faculty will be offered support on active learning instructional practices and on creating an inclusive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds. This grant project is closely linked with current priorities of the National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Engineering program. By enhancing instruction and improving the engineering classroom climate, engineering faculty are likely to create more inclusive learning environments that may increase the number of underrepresented students who pursue engineering.<br/><br/>The investigators purport to develop a training program for engineering faculty that equip them with strategies and skills to reduce their social cognitive biases and the effects of such biases have on success outcomes for students, especially underrepresented student groups. Using a mixed-method research design, the results of the faculty development program will be analyzed at multiple levels to determine the impact the project had on engineering students and faculty. If successful, it has immense potential to improve engineering instruction and classroom climate in higher education across the country. To this end, all data collections will focus on the following:<br/><br/>(1) Faculty reactions to the program,<br/>(2) Observed changes in instructional practice,<br/>(3) Student experiences of the classroom climate,<br/>(4) Student engagement in the classroom,<br/>(5) Student engagement in subsequent courses, and<br/>(6) Student retention in the engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>The project is targeting components of the effort that can be easily adapted by others, by identifying the limitations that exist and the resources that are needed to scale the effort. A website will be created to provide program information to the community and workshops are planned for meetings of the Engineering Deans Council and the SEC. The project will also leverage the ADVANCE Implementation Mentors (AIM) Network to connect with the representative institutions and further encourage adaptation of the effort's strategies and materials."

An understanding of the longer-term career paths of engineering PhDs has important implications for increasing academic persistence among engineering doctoral students, as well as informing the design of PhD programs and interventions to help prepare doctoral students for a multitude of careers in education, business, industry, and government. This integrated research and education project examines how individual factors, institutional structures, and environmental contexts converge at the PhD level to model and explain the longitudinal career patterns of engineering PhDs. By examining whether there are differences in career paths by gender, race/ethnicity, and engineering discipline, this research project will render important contextual information for various applications, such as the creation of engineering workforce policy, development of strategies that promote a competitive engineering workforce, and ways to strengthening academic-industry partnerships. The findings will provide doctoral programs with critical and actionable information for developing and enhancing training that accounts for the realities of workforce demands and student career preferences.  <br/><br/>The theoretical approach highlights the experiences of individuals at the intersection of gender, race/ethnicity, and engineering discipline rather than aggregating individuals in a monolithic group or aggregating engineering with science, technology, and mathematics fields. Informed by social cognitive career, life course, and intersectionality theories, this comprehensive examination of the longer-term career patterns of engineering doctoral graduates focuses on identifying employment patterns and transitions as a function of important demographic characteristics and doctoral education experiences using quantitative regression analyses on nationally-representative data. Through individual interviews, this research project will also pinpoint why doctoral graduates pursued certain career paths and illustrate how their individual choices intersect with institutional and environmental factors. The research project also includes a strong dissemination strategy designed for broad and meaningful impact across communities, including academic, professional, and student services associations, and industry. Specifically, the research project includes a plan for developing a professional development workshop using an integrated case study and video vignette approach to provide engineering doctoral students and early career PhDs with tools and training for longer-range career planning."

However, technologies that allow such accomplishments do not yet enable versatile and highly complex interactions with sophisticated environments. Today's intelligent systems and robots can neither sense nor move like biological systems, and devices implanted in or interfaced with neural systems cannot process neural data robustly, safely, and in a functionally meaningful way. Doing so requires a critical missing ingredient: a novel, neural-inspired approach based on a deep understanding of how biological systems acquire and process information. This is the focus of this proposal.<br/><br/>The NSF ERC for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (ERC/SNE or ""Center"") will become a global hub for delivering neural-inspired sensorimotor devices. Using devices that mine the rich data in neural signals available from implantable, wearable, and interactive interfaces, the ERC/SNE will build end-to-end integrated systems. Examples include: implantable neurochips that can activate paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles or nerve roots; stationary robots that extract neural signals from a user's touch to provide home-based, post-stroke therapy; neural-controlled adaptive prosthetic limbs that provide sophisticated sensory feedback, and wearable caps that control external exploration devices. Unlike traditional approaches that stress accommodation to the needs of people with neurological disabilities, the ERC/SNE will focus on proactive technologies that provide seamless and adaptive person-machine interaction. It will accomplish this mission with three core engineering thrusts: (1) communication and interface design for devices and data management, (2) reverse and forward engineering of neural systems and neural-inspired devices, and (3) control and adaptation technologies that express sensorimotor functions for individual needs.<br/><br/>The ERC/SNE will nurture future global multidisciplinary leaders. It will develop middle and high school project-based curricula that introduce neural engineering principles to students underrepresented in engineering. It will create multi-institution, undergraduate and graduate Neural Engineering courses with new degree structures and develop vertical research mentoring chains to build a strong research culture from faculty to K-12. It will build long-lasting and deep relationships through faculty and student exchange programs across all disciplines and partnering institutions, with a goal of removing barriers in communication across different fields, countries, and diverse backgrounds. The neural engineering field creates new pathways from the less quantitatively-based biological sciences to the more quantitatively-based engineering fields as well as pathways for people with disabilities to work in an engineering field that addresses their own experience and needs. The women and underrepresented minorities who currently account for over 40% of the Center's leadership team will serve as role models for students and starting faculty. Further, the ERC/SNE will extend its impact by identifying key technologies according to market significance and technical risk. The Center's portfolio will be constructed to deliver a steady stream of innovations over the near and long term. Its industry partnership structure includes not only small and large firms that will help shape Center IPs, but also hospitals and investment firms that will ground research activities to technologies that will truly assist people in need and steer future neural engineering market directions.<br/><br/>The ERC/NSE will strive to enhance the human experience both for persons with neurological disabilities and for the coming generation of global and diverse engineering innovators. The Center's seasoned, multi-disciplinary team will transform healthcare, manufacturing, and the educational infrastructure to guarantee neural engineering global leadership."

Disparities within these areas negatively affect the well-being of individuals, communities, and society. Community-based, private and public social-action agencies, such as soup kitchens and housing shelters, tend to operate in isolation and often have limited ability to communicate let alone collaborate with other agencies. The opportunities and challenges that lie within the intersection of health, education, and wealth require engineers, social scientists, and computer scientists working together to improve the well-being of individuals and communities. To address these disparities, this planning grant will bring together multiple, diverse interest groups to drive meaningful societal impacts and inform the development of a human-centered engineering research center. This proposed center will be focused on EMpowering People to achieve Optimal Well-being through Engineering Research (EMPOWER Center).  Regional planning meetings will connect non-profit agencies to each other, to potential industry partners, and to the engineering community. This will facilitate information sharing, idea generation, and foster the development of regional stakeholder community networks to revolutionize how our nation addresses well-being. <br/><br/>The proposed EMPOWER Center will harness, synthesize, and learn from data. This data will be gathered from disparate sources that are distributed, historically disconnected, and have varied levels or a lack of structure.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Public infrastructure investment in the US is woefully inadequate, not only to maintain existing demands, but more importantly to meet the needs of an increasingly data-driven economy. The transition to a data-driven economy depends on so-called ?smart cities? which monitor information on city utilities and operations and can respond to changing situations.  Smart infrastructure systems are in an early development stage with rapidly developing applications across water, energy, transportation and buildings. Increasingly, the data analysis skills needed for engineering smart cities, are the same skills needed for many financial models and transactions. Evidence suggests that the very data smart cities collect can lead to new financing models that help fund their development.  The planning grant team will bring together experts in these areas, as well as policy and law.  The goal is to integrate engineering design and financial models in a decision framework that seeks to overcome technical and legal barriers for deployment of intelligent infrastructures.  The societal benefits of this transition include identifying new financial instruments and resources that impacts GDP and jobs, and improves quality of life. Collaboration with public policy experts will explore how smart infrastructures can provide equitable access across rich and poor communities.  Engagement with law school colleagues will address privacy and security concerns, and the impact of data monetization on the financial system. New educational programs such as a Masters in Engineering in Smart Infrastructure Finance will be aimed at training new engineers in the era of artificial intelligence. Training will help engineers engage with business and key civic stakeholders. The described interactions between these disciplines will result in new technologies that stimulate a vibrant innovation ecosystem and facilitate access and use of these technologies. <br/><br/>The planning grant team will explore how sensor-enabled (smart) data networks provide intelligence for the design of efficient financing mechanisms to build and operationalize smart (adaptive, resilient) infrastructure systems. The planning grant activities, including two workshops, will allow the team to engage with potential academic, business and government partners. Despite the excitement, the scalability of smart city infrastructure is hampered by limited operational benchmarking, lack of robust economic models for valuation of information, and pricing mechanisms that may attract public or private investment. The research tests the hypothesis that intelligent infrastructures generate data of sufficient scope, scale, frequency and accuracy that can be aligned with, and tested against, financial models and specifications of emerging data markets.  Through these planning workshops, the proposed Center research activities and strategies to collaborate with industry, investors and the public will be further defined. The objective is to understand how physical or operational performance measurements of smart systems not only enable performance optimization or design iterations, but bring derivative value that can be used or traded in data exchanges.  How can intelligent infrastructures be safely designed - and the IoT data tested - against financial or auction models for value optimization?  Data-driven efficient capital such as insurance and derivatives (futures, options), as well as variable rate performance bonds and smart contracts, increasingly depend on real-time IoT (Internet of Things) information.  In cooperation with industry and public partners, the ERC planning grant team will develop, test and validate engineering models, econometric and financial theory principles using sensor and financial data models in a simulation environmental, and well as based on deployed pilot smart infrastructure systems.  These include smart city components such as: (storm)water utilities, intelligent transportation (roads and bridges), energy systems, and green buildings. The proposed ERC envisions structuring three trust areas reflecting complementary disciplines: (i) Risk quantification and dynamic characterization of infrastructure system data; (ii) Financial risk modeling, pricing, and information valuation in privacy- and cyber security-constrained data markets; (iii) Decision feedback models for infrastructure design, resilience management, and new investment paradigms.  The integration of engineering design with information valuation and pricing, and policy is an emerging field of inquiry and practice with implications for future designs of smart infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although research from other fields has demonstrated the value of examining the artifacts generated during research and design, there are as yet no ethnographic studies of the day-to-day practices of interdisciplinary teams in engineering education settings and the objects they create and use in those practices. Therefore, this study is significant because it fundamentally advances knowledge of interdisciplinary teamwork by developing a typology of boundary negotiating artifacts (BNAs) in interdisciplinary engineering teams. BNAs are artifacts and practices surrounding them that coordinate perspectives, create alignment between team members from different disciplines, facilitate transmission of information, and allow team members to learn from other disciplines during research and design. The project addresses a significant gap in knowledge about the actual practices and artifacts generated during the course of interdisciplinary design projects. By focusing on the daily, micro-level practices of engineers, a fuller, more accurate description of communication processes emerges than those based on interviews and normative descriptions of engineering work. Characterizing the artifacts that facilitate or hinder collaboration ultimately contributes to engineers' abilities to work with stakeholders from other backgrounds as successful boundary-spanners. This study's contribution is significant because it provides the first research-based educational materials that are designed to improve interdisciplinary design teamwork and communication through the use of an artifacts typology. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are: 1) to characterize the ways in which use and non-use of artifacts facilitates and hinders interdisciplinary teamwork and communication, 2) to develop a typology of models of artifacts created and utilized in interdisciplinary teams, and 3) to design, implement, and assess explicit incorporation of BNAs into interdisciplinary engineering courses at Washington State University and Oregon State University. Understanding the roles and uses of artifacts in interdisciplinary communication requires collecting data through long term, ethnographically-informed methods. Participant observers are collecting ethnographic data from several interdisciplinary design projects. Ethnographic data include observations and interviews with students and faculty members. Based on results from the ethnographic data, a typology of BNAs and their uses is being developed. Organizing the data in this manner allows other researchers and instructors access into the project's findings. Utilizing results of the research, BNAs are being strategically incorporated into engineering curricula to optimize their use and effectiveness. Together, these outcomes build a vital and solid foundation for future research on interdisciplinary communication processes and associated improvement of interdisciplinary design courses."

Chronic pain conditions are particularly difficult to treat, since pain is a complex experience that is not the result of a single factor. The key to better understand the complexity of pain conditions is to identify the biological changes it creates. The Engineering Research Center for Adaptive Small-systems for data Analytic Pain management (ERC-ASAP) proposes to place miniaturized autonomous sensing systems in several areas of the body. This will allow simultaneous monitoring of biological activities across multiple organs, providing insight into the causes of chronic pain and its onset.  This grant enables planning activities to establish the proposed Center, potentially leading to new breakthrough technologies for diagnosis and monitoring that could alter the national pain management landscape.<br/><br/>The activities of the NSF ERC-ASAP Planning Grant will allow for the development of the management structures and multi-disciplinary team formation. Planning grant activities will also include a diverse set of stakeholder community members, necessary for effective convergent engineering practices. The center goals are to engage representatives from the main stakeholder community for constructive dialogues to identify challenges and solutions. One major outcome will be to co-develop the center mission and goals with active, continuous user community collaboration and investment. Expert-guided stakeholder engagement workshops will build and establish a strong partnership with institutional and industrial collaborators, as well as medical experts, systems engineers and data scientists, health professionals, decision and social behavior scientists, and federal regulators.

Because of its importance, greater attention has been placed on the country's need for a strong engineering workforce and how to meet the growing demand for engineers, especially among underrepresented groups. On behalf of the Association for Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), the investigators outlined a comprehensive research project with four specific objectives: (1) assessing the number of degrees awarded over time in engineering by all colleges and universities and by race and ethnicity, gender, and engineering discipline utilizing the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systems Completion Survey, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics; (2) comparing projections in engineering degrees and projections in the engineering academic and nonacademic workforce from datasets, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Projections, to more accurately assess where engineering workforce shortages persist across specific engineering disciplines; (3) convening and engaging esteemed scholars, industry leaders, and university administrators and thought leaders to review collective data to better understand key shortage areas in engineering disciplines to establish a baseline that broadening participation leaders can use to better frame their projects; and (4) organizing current data sources and metrics into a publicly accessible resource available to engineering educators, social and behavioral scientists, and education researchers and policymakers to easily compare and analyze engineering degree awards' employment data.<br/><br/>By highlighting recent trends at the national and institutional level and determining mismatches in supply and demand, this research  project will assist engineering education leaders, stakeholders, and policymakers in developing targeted efforts to broaden participation in specific engineering disciplines among projected shortages will exist. By convening university leaders from institutions seeking to broaden participation in engineering, it is likely that partnerships and collaborations will be established across various institutions, experts, and engineering societies to address the dearth of underrepresented groups throughout the engineering enterprise. As another major outcome from this research project, the investigators proposed to develop a robust online tool, combining several national datasets, to build institutional metrics as way to assist various stakeholders and researchers with making peer and aspirational institutional comparisons. Other project deliverables include the production of two major reports, such as The Status Report on Engineering Education Volume I: A 5-year Trend Analysis of Engineering degrees awarded at the national and institutional level to determine which colleges and universities are successful at graduating Traditionally Underrepresented Groups in Specific Engineering Disciplines and The Status Report on Engineering Education Volume II: A Detailed Analysis of Projections for Engineering Degrees and the Engineering Academic and Nonacademic Workforce.

""Habits of mind"" are modes of thinking required to become effective problem solvers capable of transferring such skills to new contexts. Such skills form an essential part of engineer's professional mindset. This project studies undergraduate engineering students' habits of mind related to computing. The novelty of the proposed approach is that the data collection and analysis methods integrate machine learning with methods traditionally used in education to analyze data.<br/> <br/>The guiding education research question of the project is: What computational habits of mind do engineering students exhibit at different points of their academic development? The goal of the effort is to provide a better understanding of how these patterns relate to academic achievement, which in turn informs learning pathways toward computational proficiency in engineering. The project follows an Explanatory Sequential Mixed Method Design to study engineering students' computational habits of mind by integrating machine learning in a mixed method research. High-dimensional quantitative data is collected for each learner and machine learning is used to find patterns corresponding to groups of similar learners. By dividing the learners into similarity groups, these patterns provide a higher detail of understanding than global analysis methods. The reasons behind the patterns will be identified by collecting and analyzing qualitative data. Building on the machine learning results, an automatic subject selection strategy is used to reduce the number of learners considered to a manageable size for the qualitative part of the research. The goal of this learner reduction strategy is to obtain a small but statistically meaningful sampling for each group of subjects in order to focus resources for the most costly and time consuming part of the research. By doing so, mixed method research is shown to be scalable to large and complex datasets. <br/><br/>The rationale for this project is that its successful completion: a) addresses challenges in cultivating a culture of lifelong learning among professional and future engineers; b) provides an understanding of how patterns of habits of mind relate to academic achievement, which in turn informs learning pathways toward computational proficiency in engineering; and (c) demonstrates how mixed method research can be scaled up to study very large and complex multidimensional datasets through the use of machine learning. This effort supports the need for the foundation in engineering students' education to incorporate necessary skills such as creativity, ingenuity, professionalism, persistence, and willingness to take calculated risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vision of CIAN is to create transformative technologies for optical access networks where virtually any application requiring any resource can be seamlessly and efficiently aggregated and interfaced with existing and future core networks in a cost-effective manner.  Analogous to the evolution over decades of today?s computer laptop using massive integration of discrete electronic components, the CIAN vision would lead to the creation of the PC equivalent of the optical access network by employing optoelectronic integration to enable affordable and flexible access to any type of service, including delivery of data rates approaching 10 Gigabits/sec to a broad population base anywhere and at anytime.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of CIAN includes: (1) transforming expensive discrete components-based subsystems into flexible cost-effective integrated optoelectronic subsystems to achieve scaleable and affordable high-data-rate access networks; and (2) demonstrating flexible network functionalities by moving services from the higher layers of the network closer to the physical layer.  To achieve these goals, the CIAN strategic research program is organized into three integrated technical thrusts.  Thrust 1: Optical Communication Systems and Networking will act as the ?top-down? driver for the development and integration of components and devices to enable and demonstrate novel network functionalities for applications including ultra high-data-rate processing centers.  Thrust 2: Subsystem Integration and Silicon Nanophotonics will explore signal conditioning, processing, reconfiguration, and control functions realized with various platforms including CMOS compatible nanostructures and silicon nanophotonics, and multifunctional integrated subsystems exploiting monolithic and heterogeneous integration.  Thrust 3: Materials and Devices will act as the scientific and technological foundation by conducting research on new materials, device technologies, processing and integration methods for chip-scale integrated optoelectronics.  The shared CIAN Testbed is a research facility that allows CIAN?s comprehensive vertically structured research efforts to be integrated, enabling effective systems-driven collaborative research among participants and the wider research and industrial community.   <br/><br/>The broader impacts of CIAN?s research will be felt in every home and in the quality of life.  Ultra-high data rate and cost effective services will contribute to business innovation, improve educational opportunities, enhance distribution of medical services, avoid the expense and human costs of unnecessary commuting, minimize the environmental impact from infrastructure and pollution, substantially reduce dependence on energy imports, enable new and varied entertainment opportunities, and increase overall national security.  The infrastructure to carry these services is as precious a national resource as the air, rail, and road transportation system or the electrical power grid.  Education, research, and knowledge transfer will be integrated through the team-based multidisciplinary environment of CIAN.  The education, outreach and diversity efforts will focus on educating a skilled and diverse workforce including Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans.  CIAN will have an extensive pre-college education and outreach program.  Creation of intellectual property and technology transfer will be a cornerstone of CIAN?s efforts.<br/>"

Safety is ensured by designing our aerospace, civil, and marine structures to withstand operational, environmental, and expected or unexpected extreme loads throughout their designed service lifetimes, and now many such structures are being pushed to serve society well past their design life. Although the structural health monitoring (SHM) field has brought new technologies, algorithms, and methods to improve damage detection, quantification, and assessment, what is missing is the ability to translate detected damage data into actionable information for stakeholders and owners to act on to ensure structural safety and performance, given relevant constraints. Information obtained through this new paradigm of Designing for Safety is crucial for informing design, repair, retrofit, and/or replacement of other existing similar structures or for future, new designs, thereby feeding back to attain the vision of Safety by Design. This research will directly address the challenge of acquiring and interpreting appropriate data streams (whether obtained through numerical modeling, experimental tests, and/or operational measurements) to synthesize information and create actionable knowledge that will enable accurate assessment and improvement of structural design, health, and performance. To achieve this goal, this REU Site at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) will recruit and train 12 diverse U.S. scholars for eight weeks each summer, recruited from across the nation with emphasis on broadening the participation of underrepresented minority, women, and economically-disadvantaged students. These students will conduct research alongside six professors and their graduate students. In addition to immersing REU students in an intensive summer research program, a plethora of career development, lab tours, graduate school application preparation, seminars, and social activities are also planned to provide each U.S. scholar with a life-changing, multidisciplinary, summer experience. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this NSF REU Site is to immerse students in a meaningful and highly interdisciplinary research environment within the structural engineering domain and to teach them that design does not end with construction. Instead, designing for safety embodies: quantifying potential load conditions, damage mechanics, and uncertainties; monitoring for anomalies during operations; processing this information through cyber-modeling via digital surrogates; and translating the information to actionable knowledge for improving current and future system designs. First, from concept inception to defining performance metrics to structural design, transformative research and education are needed to devise methods for aggregating and fusing computational and experimental data to inform the capabilities of different designs and the probabilities of exceeding certain safety-states. Second, once deployed, SHM/prognosis is central to achieving total structural state awareness through the integration of sensing data from multiple sources (""Internet-of-Things""), cyber modeling, and statistical pattern recognition. Finally, information acquired throughout design and operations, when combined with innovative optimization methods and a multi-scale, multi-physics, digital surrogate twin of the structure, is crucial for realizing future structural designs that outperform its predecessors. Research results generated through this project will bridge key knowledge gaps revealing the interrelations between damage formation, propagation, detection, structural modeling, model-updating, assessment, and design optimization. The planned student activities will equip young U.S. scholars with multidisciplinary technical skills and diverse perspectives so that they are uniquely poised to tackle complex, interdisciplinary, and systems-level grand challenges throughout their entire careers. The students' contributions to research and their summer experiences will raise awareness and stimulate interests in pursuing future STEM careers, which will stimulate a positive feedback loop so that novel solutions for Designing for Safety and Safety by Design will arrive sooner rather than later. UC San Diego is uniquely positioned to host this REU Site, since it is the only institution in the U.S. with programs in SHM and prognosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In our increasingly global economy, students must be adequately prepared to meet the demands of the engineering workforce. However, many students do not have international exposure prior to college or the experience of interacting with others from a variety of backgrounds. As such, understanding how to improve team interactions within culturally diverse groups can provide novel opportunities for students to more deeply appreciate differences in engineering teams while simultaneously deepening their understanding of engineering concepts. This project is focused on how students participate in diverse engineering teams in first-year courses and how their participation impacts students' multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity. Multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity have been shown to help achieve a common group identity that is essential to effective teams. This project is motivated by two broader goals in the engineering education community and promoted by ABET which are complementary: 1) to graduate students with an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams and 2) to give students the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions globally. Understanding the experiences of students engaging in engineering design and the resulting shifts in attitudes will help identify practical ways to increase students' understanding and appreciation of people from diverse backgrounds. These interventions may change the culture of engineering at these institutions to make it more inclusive of underrepresented students. This project is supported by the Research in Engineering Education program and the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  This research project contributes to foundational knowledge about broadening participation in STEM.<br/> <br/>This sequential explanatory mixed methods study will address the gap in the current literature to understand how students interact in diverse teams.  Student demographic data will include race, ethnicity, gender, disability and other information to be used as variables in the data analyses and interpretations of the findings. The first phase of research will quantitatively measure effects of diverse team formation on diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness. A baseline survey of student attitudes will be collected at the beginning of their first-year engineering class before students are grouped into teams. Students will be grouped into diverse teams via the Comprehensive Assessment for Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) and surveyed mid- and end-semester to track changes in diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness based on team composition using time series structural equation modeling.  Additionally, social network analysis will be used to understand how students work within and outside of their assigned teams on engineering tasks to identify boundary crossing individuals within engineering. Finally, multiple streams of data will be collected on team interactions during engineering tasks (audio recording, video recording, observation, and work products). The second phase of research will conduct interpretative phenomenological interviews with students to understand students' experiences working in diverse teams. Students participating in interviews will also be asked to complete Implicit Association Tests to elicit in-group preferences. The use of interpretative phenomenological interviews allows for the creation of understanding through the analysis of students' lived experiences while still allowing the researcher to leverage understanding from existing literature. This qualitative methodology allows us to successfully transfer interpretive results beyond the bounds of this work to advance the conversations around diverse teaming in engineering. By combining the methodologies outlined in this work we can identify members of the community who are made ""out-group"" members by their peers and empirically understand the practices of individuals that drive the creation of out-groups and these students' experiences in engineering teaming environments. The findings of this work can have significant impact in how students are grouped and taught within engineering teams, which can improve students' experiences to make engineering more inclusive and teaming skills more effective."

While there are many successful efforts by individuals and small groups, large-scale curricular changes are key to maintaining these successes. Earlier data collected and analyzed by this team shows that one of the barriers to large-scale curricular change is understanding how to credential innovative educational practices, particularly those practices that do not take place in a traditional, lecture-oriented classroom. Credentialing is an important mark for students looking for quality education programs as well as employers looking for quality graduates. This study uses the real experiences of engineering degree programs that are innovative across their curriculum to learn how they navigated the credentialing processes. The impact of the work is to determine pathways to turn the use of credentialing as a barrier to better engineering education into a lever for getting more engineering programs to make large-scale innovations. <br/><br/>Even when engineering curricular changes are systemic, earlier data collected by this team shows that credentialing is a key, though often misunderstood or not explicitly acknowledged, barrier to real, sustainable improvement to engineering education practice. Communication across implementation levels (e.g., course, curriculum, university credentialing) and their research to practice cycles is not straightforward, even though it is necessary to produce sustainable change in engineering education. Therefore, the goal of this research is to answer: What gaps exist and how do we bridge innovative curricular/pedagogical initiatives and credentialing at the institutional, federal, and accreditation levels? Data collection and analysis in years 1 and 2 will allow the team to explore and describe the role credentialing plays in sustainable engineering education change. The research team and advisory board will address ways to expand the research-to-practice cycle so that university-level infrastructure is included. The team will broadly disseminate the results via Implementation Workshops that will include faculty, administrators and staff, as well as through traditional publications and conferences. <br/><br/>This work will: 1) Explore the role credentialing plays in sustainable engineering curricular change from multiple viewpoints, including faculty, academic administrators, registrar and financial aid staff, accreditors, and others; 2) Expand the research to practice cycle to include the infrastructure within which both the research and the practice occur; and 3) Develop and disseminate materials to inform change agents so they can increase the efficacy of their credentialing efforts. The results of the project include: a model of change that recognizes the potential infrastructure barriers to innovation in engineering education, materials for university change agents to help them navigate the credentialing process, and increased understanding of how to support and sustain long term change in engineering education."

When making decisions, everyone, including engineers, uses at least three distinct forms of reasoning: rational, intuitive and emotive. Each reasoning pattern plays a valuable role in decision-making, and people's underlying beliefs about different forms of reasoning informs their approach to decision-making. Since our society relies on engineers to make robust decisions, a critical part of the professional formation of engineers is development of beliefs about different reasoning strategies. However, we do not know much about engineering students' beliefs in this area. What we do know is that undergraduate engineering students typically receive little formal instruction on how to make complex decisions. What instruction they do receive is often limited to analysis in contexts of abundant information or the introduction of rational decision-making tools. Typical engineering instruction may convey to students, who make decisions rationally, intuitively, and emotionally, that rational approaches alone are valuable. The sole focus on rational forms of reasoning may discourage some students from continuing in engineering. This project will investigate the beliefs that engineering students hold about decision-making and how these beliefs are influenced by their experiences with the engineering curricula. Findings from this project will be leveraged to change how decision-making is taught so engineering curricula will be more inclusive and realistic.<br/><br/>To characterize engineering students' beliefs about different forms of reasoning for decision-making near the end of undergraduate engineering formation, this qualitative, exploratory study will: (i) develop and validate interview and reflection protocols, (ii) collect and analyze data using these protocols through semi-structured, one-on-one interviews and written reflections both during a capstone design experience and one year later, and (iii) engage capstone design instructors in translating the findings to recommendations for practice. The research team will utilize a framework for decision-making that values at least three different forms of reasoning: rational, intuitive, and emotive to guide their investigation. The pilot study in Year 1 will validate the data collection protocols before performing a larger study in Year 2. In both studies, written reflections will be submitted by participants at regular intervals to capture their beliefs about decision-making in the context of a capstone design experience. Also, interviews will be conducted both before and after participants receive formal instruction on decision-making in their capstone design courses. After written reflections and interview data have been analyzed, findings from the study are expected to shed light on students' beliefs. The findings will then be translated to concrete recommendations for the teaching and learning of decision-making in engineering through the engagement of capstone design practitioners with backgrounds; including industrial design, engineering industry, and entrepreneurship. The purpose is to change how engineering decision-making is taught and to hopefully change students' beliefs about engineering decision-making and their commitment to engineering. This work could be instrumental in transforming engineering education to be more inclusive though improving the ways in which undergraduates develop their beliefs about different forms of reasoning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this study is to design and implement a survey that measures engineering education researchers' and practitioners' views on the role of research in education. The data will be collected at the 2019 CoNECD (Collaborative Network for Engineering and Computing Diversity), which is a conference specifically designed to link research and practice. The findings of this study will generate concrete data that will reveal underlying differences between education researchers' and practitioners' perspectives on one of the thorniest issues in education: how to convert research to practice. Gaining a better understanding of what bolsters the gap between research and practice in engineering education context will lead to the development of tools and professional development resources that will be useful in bridging this divide in engineering education and other STEM education disciplines. Strengthening connections between research and practice in engineering education will improve the impact of publicly-supported STEM education research. It will also contribute to the development of a more diverse and competent workforce that is well prepared to address society's greatest challenges and opportunities.<br/> <br/>The goal of this project is two-pronged: 1) to develop a valid and reliable instrument for measuring education researchers' and practitioners' perspectives on the role of research in education using a framework Bulterman-Bos; and 2) implement it at an upcoming conference specifically designed to bring together engineering education researchers and practitioners in order to determine if there are statistically significant differences in responses based on the participants' role.

As such, it will be relevant to a wide variety of stakeholders in engineering education and other STEM education-related fields struggling to bridge connections between research and practice.  Deploying this instrument at the CoNECD conference will ensure that the findings are informed by both groups of stakeholders, and the people who are in the best position to offer insights about how to foster connections between research and practice. The existence of dichotomous views, if found to be substantiated by data, could leads to a myriad of practical things that could be done to change how researchers and practitioners communicate with and inform one another's work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both mathematics course placement and performance are strong graduation predictors in engineering, even after controlling for demographic characteristics. Underrepresented students (e.g., rural students, low-income students, first-generation students, and students of color) are disproportionately represented in cohorts that enter engineering programs not yet calculus-ready. Frequently, the time and cost of obtaining an engineering degree is increased, and the likelihood of obtaining the degree is also reduced. This educational problem is particularly acute for African American students who attended select high schools in South Carolina, with extremely high-poverty rates. As a result, the investigators proposed an NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project to develop a statewide consortium in South Carolina - comprising all of the public four-year institutions with ABET-approved engineering degree programs, all of the technical colleges, and 118 high schools with 70% or higher poverty rates, to pinpoint and address the barriers that prevent these students from being calculus ready in engineering. <br/><br/>This NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project will map completion/attrition pathways of students by collecting robust cross-sectional data to identify and understand the complex linkages between and behind critical decisions. Such data have not been available to this extent, especially focused on diverse populations. Further, by developing structural equation models (SEMs), the investigators will be able to build on extant research, contributing directly to understanding the relative impact of a range of latent variables on the development of engineering identity, particularly among African American, rural, low-income, and first-generation engineering students. Results of the pilot interventions are likely to contribute to the empirical and theoretical literature that focus on engineering persistence among underrepresented populations. Project plans also include developing a centralized database compatible to the Multiple Institution Database for Investigation of Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) project to share institutional data with K-12 and postsecondary administrators, engineering educators, and education researchers with NSF INCLUDES projects and beyond."

The goal of this collaborative effort will be to establish a Hierarchical Nanomanufacturing Node for computational tools development aimed at creating smart, model- and data-driven nanomanufacturing. By leveraging emerging advances in computing and cyberinfrastructure, the vision of this node is to simulate every step of the manufacturing process of a nano-enabled product.  Simulation tools developed will be optimized and tested for utility by stakeholders including researchers in nanotechnology and related industrial sectors. In addition, the impact of this 5-year activity on the nanomanufacturing industry will be critically assessed. The node will be part of the established Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN) Cyber Platform. <br/><br/>The mission of the nanoMFG Node is to be the engine for design, simulation, planning, and optimization of highly relevant nano-manufacturing growth and patterning processes. Both working with the existing cyber framework (nanoHUB) and facilitating development of human resources that will broadly impact nanomanufacturing and nanotechnology are essential to this mission. To help achieve this mission, computational tools for nanomanufacturing aimed at multiscale theory, modeling, and simulation (TM&S) will be developed and broadly disseminated. The intellectual merit of this 5-year activity is the development of nanomanufacturing simulation tools, validated by experimental data, and integrated with data-driven uncertainty quantification. The framework for the effort is based on a layered computational tool infrastructure comprising the creation of the following: (1) nanoscale transport phenomena models, (2) process models, (3) uncertainty quantification framework, (4) application and empirical validation of process models, (5) tools for multiscale transport phenomena, and (6) tools for nanoscale self-assembly.   <br/><br/>Beyond nanomanufacturing, the burgeoning field of nanoscience will significantly benefit from free, open-source computational tools that have been validated by experiments. The collaboration will bring researchers, educators, industries, national labs, and high schools together to form a cohesive framework to advance nanoscience and resulting nanotechnologies, promote STEM education, and build the human resources necessary to make nanomanufacturing an economically viable engine for society. This will have several impacts on realizing the varied promises promulgated by nanotechnology as it pertains to: accelerating the high-tech economy, improving human health, and positively impacting an array of manufacturing industry domains including aviation, automotive, agricultural, construction machinery, and many others. Efforts to promote workforce diversification are tightly interwoven into this effort to both help increase participation from underrepresented groups and institutions and also to add to the richness of the tools being developed.  Fellowships will be competitively awarded annually to help train the next generation workforce not only on simulation and modeling tool development but also on the value of community building and sharing of resources and expertise, thus building a nationwide innovation ecosystem for economic development of the U.S. and its leadership worldwide."

In our increasingly global economy, students must be adequately prepared to meet the demands of the engineering workforce. However, many students do not have international exposure prior to college or the experience of interacting with others from a variety of backgrounds. As such, understanding how to improve team interactions within culturally diverse groups can provide novel opportunities for students to more deeply appreciate differences in engineering teams while simultaneously deepening their understanding of engineering concepts. This project is focused on how students participate in diverse engineering teams in first-year courses and how their participation impacts students' multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity. Multicultural effectiveness and diversity sensitivity have been shown to help achieve a common group identity that is essential to effective teams. This project is motivated by two broader goals in the engineering education community and promoted by ABET which are complementary: 1) to graduate students with an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams and 2) to give students the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions globally. Understanding the experiences of students engaging in engineering design and the resulting shifts in attitudes will help identify practical ways to increase students' understanding and appreciation of people from diverse backgrounds. These interventions may change the culture of engineering at these institutions to make it more inclusive of underrepresented students. This project is supported by the Research in Engineering Education program and the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, specifically the ECR Research in Disabilities Education area of special interest. ECR emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  This research project contributes to foundational knowledge about broadening participation in STEM.<br/> <br/>This sequential explanatory mixed methods study will address the gap in the current literature to understand how students interact in diverse teams.  Student demographic data will include race, ethnicity, gender, disability and other information to be used as variables in the data analyses and interpretations of the findings. The first phase of research will quantitatively measure effects of diverse team formation on diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness. A baseline survey of student attitudes will be collected at the beginning of their first-year engineering class before students are grouped into teams. Students will be grouped into diverse teams via the Comprehensive Assessment for Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) and surveyed mid- and end-semester to track changes in diversity sensitivity and multicultural effectiveness based on team composition using time series structural equation modeling.  Additionally, social network analysis will be used to understand how students work within and outside of their assigned teams on engineering tasks to identify boundary crossing individuals within engineering. Finally, multiple streams of data will be collected on team interactions during engineering tasks (audio recording, video recording, observation, and work products). The second phase of research will conduct interpretative phenomenological interviews with students to understand students' experiences working in diverse teams. Students participating in interviews will also be asked to complete Implicit Association Tests to elicit in-group preferences. The use of interpretative phenomenological interviews allows for the creation of understanding through the analysis of students' lived experiences while still allowing the researcher to leverage understanding from existing literature. This qualitative methodology allows us to successfully transfer interpretive results beyond the bounds of this work to advance the conversations around diverse teaming in engineering. By combining the methodologies outlined in this work we can identify members of the community who are made ""out-group"" members by their peers and empirically understand the practices of individuals that drive the creation of out-groups and these students' experiences in engineering teaming environments. The findings of this work can have significant impact in how students are grouped and taught within engineering teams, which can improve students' experiences to make engineering more inclusive and teaming skills more effective."

Online courses have become an increasingly utilized and important instructional method in undergraduate engineering education. The online format can provide educational opportunities to students who otherwise may not have access and, therefore, has the potential to positively affect the size and makeup of the nation's engineering workforce. However, students in online courses drop out of these courses at greater rates than those in more traditional, face-to-face courses. The proposed work will utilize the online undergraduate engineering degree programs at Arizona State University to generate a model that describes and predicts course-level persistence based on the following types of data: attributes of individual students, tracking data that shows where and when students click within their online course learning management system, and information about the online courses themselves. The immediate impact of the work will be an increased understanding of the reasons that undergraduate engineering students choose to stay in or drop online courses. In the longer term, the findings will also contribute to efforts that support a greater percentage of online undergraduate engineering students successfully completing their degree programs.<br/><br/>During the project, a Model of Online Course-level Persistence in Engineering grounded in theories of student motivation and online and undergraduate engineering student persistence will be developed and empirically evaluated. The project proposes three studies. The Student Experiences Study uses a longitudinal, within-person approach to investigate how undergraduate engineering students' experiences in their online course influence their beliefs about their likelihood of success in the course, their perceptions of the value of the course, their level of engagement in the course, and their ultimate decision to complete the course. The Learning Management System Interaction Study applies the learner-based technique of associative classification to historical data from online undergraduate engineering courses at Arizona State University to describe students' patterns of engagement with their online course learning management system as they relate to course-level persistence. The final Persistence Modeling Study generates a unified measure of course engagement from these patterns. This measure will be used in a longitudinal structural equation modeling analysis that compares three variations on the model of online course-level persistence: (1) a variation in which engagement is included as a partial mediator of the relationships between expectancies of course success, course task values, perceptions of course characteristics, and course-level persistence, (2) a variation in which engagement is conceptualized as a full mediator of the relationships between expectancies of course success, course task values, perceptions of course characteristics, and persistence to course completion, and (3) a variation in which engagement is not included at all.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will investigate engineering students' experiences during undergraduate programs that predict their beliefs about climate change and empowerment to address its related implications for sustainability in their careers. This study is the first of its kind to explore how experiences in college impact students' climate change beliefs and interest to address related implications for sustainability. To advance understanding, undergraduate engineering seniors' attitudes, empowerment, career goals, and experiences will be measured using a nationally representative survey just prior to students entering the workforce. When topics related to climate change and its implications for sustainability are included in these settings, the expectation is to find an increase in student willingness to take action to address the issues. This quantitative approach can provide generalizable trends about what happens during college and how it affects students' self-beliefs and long-term goals. Findings will be translated into practice through 1-2-page research briefs that explain the implications of the research to discipline specific engineering faculty. Educators can then develop curriculum to empower students to make change in their world and will likely to lead to more consideration for sustainability interests when setting career goals. By strengthening the relationship between awareness and action about climate change we can increase the number of U.S. educated engineers ready to address such complex sociotechnical challenges.<br/><br/>This research builds on critical engineering agency theory in which students' learning and interest is enhanced when they see an opportunity to make change in their world. Critical engineering agency includes an individual's growing professional identity and attachment to their practice as an engineer. The guiding research question is, how do engineering students develop critical engineering agency and beliefs in college to address climate change and its implications for sustainability in their careers? This question will be answered using a nationally representative survey (n=4000) distributed to students in senior design or capstone courses. This quantitative approach will provide generalizable trends about influential experiences during college. A panel data analysis will help uncover differences among students' sustainability beliefs compared to prior collected data. We will also investigate differences in engineering identities among disciplines and predict both engineering agency and career expectations from their college experiences using MANOVA. Without recognition of climate change, action to address the issue is less likely to occur. The long-term vision is that this research becomes a catalyst for teaching about topics related to climate change and its implications for sustainability. Teaching will support students' critical engineering agency (e.g., empowerment and identity in engineering contexts) and beliefs about sustainability. Students' agency and beliefs may influence their career choice and expected career outcomes. As a result, more engineering students will pursue careers to solve societal challenges that mitigate and prepare for climate change and its global implications for sustainability."

However, most engineers graduating from engineering degree programs are more alike in their problem solving approaches, ways of thinking, and engineering identities than different in their skills as innovative thinkers. Students who do not conform to this mold of ""being an engineer"" are often alienated from engineering, do not develop engineering identities, and leave engineering, which reduces the much-needed human potential for innovation. This project responds to these challenges by characterizing and empirically understanding how to support students' innovative mindsets and engineering identities. These underlying differences are termed latent diversity, attributes that are present as potential sources for innovation, but are not visible or actualized. The outcomes of this work will help create more inclusive college classrooms that accept a wider set of students and produce engineers who can adopt various perspectives for innovative problem solutions. These diverse engineers will be more prepared to address the grand challenges of the 21st century. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to characterize how diverse students experience the culture of engineering and negotiate their identities as engineers. This research can actualize the power of students' alternative mindsets and ways of thinking for greater innovation in engineering solutions. It also expands traditional strands of research on diversity in engineering in complementary and transformative ways. This project uses mixed methods to determine: 1) what kinds of diversity in thought, innovation mindsets, and attitudes are present in engineering students; 2) how undergraduate students with latent diversity form engineering identities within an engineering community of practice over time; and 3) what support, both inside and outside of the classroom, can be provided to promote inclusion of students with latent diversity in engineering. To garner this insight, national survey data from first-year engineering students will be collected and latent diversity will be characterized by using topological data analysis. From these results, longitudinal narrative interviews with latently diverse students will be use to understand students' identity development and how this identity development is supported or hindered by their classroom experiences and institutional structure. These narratives will be analyzed both deductively (informed by identity-trajectory theory) and inductively (based on individual experiences) to propose a new theoretical framework of latent diversity that can be incorporated into researchers' and practitioners' ways of understanding how to educate engineering students. <br/><br/>The integrated education plan will implement pedagogies to support the development of latently diverse students in first-year engineering programs (a critical time point at which many talented students are lost from engineering programs). Workshops for educators, co-curricular support program staff, and engineering administrators and policy makers will be developed to reframe ways of thinking about engineering students and enact evidence-based practices that can support students both in and out of the classroom. This approach will provide key engineering education personnel with novel tools to develop a new generation of innovators. The integrated research and educational plan will directly impact the educational experiences of thousands of engineering students to develop innovative, rather than homogeneous, engineers."

Understanding how internships impact the engineering professional identity of first generation and low-income students, and the barriers and supports for these students to access internship experiences, increases social mobility and develops the U.S. technology sector by strengthening a pathway into the engineering workforce for these students. Furthermore, understanding how internships influence professional engineering identity can increase engagement between academia and industry, and enable students, career counselors, and human resources directors to facilitate impactful internship experiences, particularly for first generation low-income students.<br/><br/>This study generates new knowledge pertaining to later-year undergraduate students, how they form identity as a professional engineer as they prepare to enter the workforce, and how that is mediated by first generation low-income status.

Perhaps the most important technical challenge over the next several decades will be how to address energy needs without heavy reliance on fossil fuels. The electric power system transmission infrastructure must play a critical role in any viable solution. Unfortunately, the power grid is aging and already operating outside its design limits. Desired performance in efficiency, reliability, and security cannot be attained when renewable sources such as, wind and solar, reach significant levels that will add complexity and uncertainty to system operation. Allowing greater control of demand with smart metering provides an excellent opportunity. Yet, the core challenge facing operation of an extremely large, complex electric network with tens of thousands of transmission lines, buses and potentially millions of control points, remains unaddressed. Ultra-wide-area coordination for system operation is critically needed to avoid future transmission network instabilities and congestion bottlenecks and to minimize the risk of cascading failures. This ERC will seek the fundamental breakthroughs and investigate the enabling technologies needed to achieve a resilient transmission network on a continental scale, while educating a new generation of electric power and energy systems engineering leaders with a global perspective coming from diverse backgrounds. Specifically, the proposed ERC research will:<br/>--Develop new systems methodologies to take advantage of advancements in wide-area measurement and communication to allow coordinated action on a continental ultra-wide scale. Cost effective, Global Positioning System (GPS) time synchronized, wide-area measurements with milliseconds data rate can transform today's granular Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system into a high resolution system, enabling dynamic observation and control.<br/>--Flatten the control and information structure so it is less hierarchical and can replace, at all levels of the power grid, traditional inflexible operations strategies. The existing grid controls need to be replaced by a simpler, flatter structure of local control operating with guidance from global situational awareness.<br/>--Draw on high performance computing capability to realize large-scale and faster-than-real-time simulation for predictive control (and fast response) to ensure secure and reliable operation. Real-time calculation of the ""dynamic state"" of the grid on a continental scale will be feasible.<br/>--Investigate the use of widely allocated high power electronic actuators coupled with transmission level energy storage to stabilize grids during disturbances and moderate supply-demand imbalances resulting in high speed power flow control for full use of assets across the interconnected system."

Thus, broadening participation in engineering from underrepresented groups is a critical priority. To meet this need, this project focuses on economically disadvantaged rural students, particularly women and other underrepresented groups. Traditional models of career choice stressing interest as a primary career choice driver break down in rural contexts, where instead community values, local economic drivers, and strong family networks often play a critical role. As a result, this project shifts the focus from individual students to the communities themselves to understand how key stakeholders and organizations support the career choices of rural youth. With this knowledge, the investigators will engage target rural communities in participatory design workshops so that they might leverage their unique community assets to support more of their youth, particularly underrepresented groups, to pursue engineering careers. <br/><br/>The project begins with focus group and individual interviews with undergraduate engineering students from selected rural high schools that are known for producing high numbers of engineering majors. These data lay the foundation for interviews with key members of students' home communities and observations of salient programs or events to provide a rich understanding of the beliefs, experiences, and values of each community. Data analysis includes both within-case and cross case analysis. Further, the results of the multi-case study will be used to guide participatory design workshops with rural schools and communities in the region that do not typically produce engineering majors. These workshops will foster dialogue that explores factors that support or hinder transfer of practices to low-producing schools and identifies policies and strategies that would enhance each community's ability to better support engineering as a potential career choice. The study uses the southwestern region of Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains, as its primary focus, but research on career choice among rural students generally points to the potential transferability of the findings and methods. This project advances knowledge about engineering career choice and rural education by capturing the perspectives of community members who often play key roles in students' career and academic decisions, particularly in rural communities."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.  This award funds planning efforts to create the ubiquitous use of information technology with inherent security and controllable privacy, through development of a novel hardware and software ecosystem, where components are physically unique and security properties are based on this deeply embedded, physically unchangeable identity. The trustworthiness of components will be evaluated across a wide variety of embedded systems and potential threats.  The best ways to develop open hardware and software to allow broad analysis and a competitive ecosystem will be considered.  This award will be used to organize and run several planning meetings with potential participants and stakeholders.   An education and outreach program is also planned for this effort, ranging from new graduate and undergraduate courses to summer engineering institutes for high school students. The team will include students in the planning meeting to offer novel insights on educational opportunities.<br/><br/>The research problems that will be tackled by the planning team will span from low-level integrated circuit design (e.g., development and use of physically unclonable functions and lattice-based cryptography) to system-level hardware and software problems (e.g., using physical chip characteristics to achieve security properties for program execution and data) to inter-device communication (e.g. secure network connections). The economics of open architectures, threats of reverse engineering and legal issues add human and societal dimensions that must be considered. The driving applications for this work aim to address society-scale challenges: secure processing and chain of trust for electronic voting systems, controllable dissemination of private data in healthcare systems, verifiable execution in embedded systems for defense, infrastructure and transportation applications.  A plan for new course work at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels will be developed, as well as a plan for a summer institute targeting high school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attempts to fix this ""leaky pipeline"" rarely address the fact that the culture, rather than academics, may be driving students away. Throughout their academic careers, students ask themselves, ""What are the attributes inherent in being an engineer?"" Far too often, the answer to that question is defined by outdated engineering ways of knowing, thinking, and doing. Such lack of inclusivity, especially when college students are forming their professional identity, has a significant impact on their interest and the appeal of an engineering occupation. To better expand the profession, there is a need to identify and understand the impact of social-engineering norms in university programs and in the profession. Reshaping Norms serves to address this need by studying the impacts of a series of classroom interventions. The focus of Reshaping Norms is to identify and reshape the norms that cause a student to form (or not form) an identity of themselves as a future engineer. As a society, we must encourage the creation of new perspectives because the ability to innovate and exploit niche markets is better served by people who bring a wide-range of diverse experiences to the engineering profession. Similarly, the ability of the public to make well-informed decisions is better served by a diverse profession actively engaged within their communities. This project serves to address these needs by broadening the characterization of engineering identity and catalyzing the engagement of students with their communities.<br/><br/>The goal of Reshaping Norms will be accomplished by reducing barriers to diversity and improving students' sense of belonging through pedagogies, strategies, and initiatives aimed at: 1) creating an inclusive classroom community; and 2) incorporating relevancy into course activities. The creation of an inclusive classroom community will be accomplished by explicitly raising awareness of factors of attrition, democratically establishing norms of participation, and role model case-studies. Relevancy will be incorporated through authentic analysis and design experiences based on student interests, and civic engagement with local community organizations. The research plan is guided by the following questions: 1) To what extent do Reshaping Norms classroom interventions affect underrepresented students' engineering identity?; and 2) To what extent do the Reshaping Norms classroom interventions affect underrepresented engineering students' self-efficacy in engineering? This two-year project will be implemented in three iterations (alpha, beta, and gamma). Data collected during the alpha and beta iterations will be analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention tools, determine evidence of growth of students' interest and/or self-efficacy, inform revisions to subsequent interventions, and develop a full quasi-experimental study (gamma iteration). The study will include data collection from both intervention and control courses within two separate sections of a targeted engineering course. To answer the research questions, the study will utilize two previously developed instruments: one to measure engineering identity and one to measure self-efficacy toward the field of engineering. The results of this study will be used to generate new findings about the formation of engineering students' identity as it relates to their feelings of belonging in the profession."

This research will investigate engineering students' experiences during undergraduate programs that predict their beliefs about climate change and empowerment to address its related implications for sustainability in their careers. This study is the first of its kind to explore how experiences in college impact students' climate change beliefs and interest to address related implications for sustainability. To advance understanding, undergraduate engineering seniors' attitudes, empowerment, career goals, and experiences will be measured using a nationally representative survey just prior to students entering the workforce. When topics related to climate change and its implications for sustainability are included in these settings, the expectation is to find an increase in student willingness to take action to address the issues. This quantitative approach can provide generalizable trends about what happens during college and how it affects students' self-beliefs and long-term goals. Findings will be translated into practice through 1-2-page research briefs that explain the implications of the research to discipline specific engineering faculty. Educators can then develop curriculum to empower students to make change in their world and will likely to lead to more consideration for sustainability interests when setting career goals. By strengthening the relationship between awareness and action about climate change we can increase the number of U.S. educated engineers ready to address such complex sociotechnical challenges.<br/><br/>This research builds on critical engineering agency theory in which students' learning and interest is enhanced when they see an opportunity to make change in their world. Critical engineering agency includes an individual's growing professional identity and attachment to their practice as an engineer. The guiding research question is, how do engineering students develop critical engineering agency and beliefs in college to address climate change and its implications for sustainability in their careers? This question will be answered using a nationally representative survey (n=4000) distributed to students in senior design or capstone courses. This quantitative approach will provide generalizable trends about influential experiences during college. A panel data analysis will help uncover differences among students' sustainability beliefs compared to prior collected data. We will also investigate differences in engineering identities among disciplines and predict both engineering agency and career expectations from their college experiences using MANOVA. Without recognition of climate change, action to address the issue is less likely to occur. The long-term vision is that this research becomes a catalyst for teaching about topics related to climate change and its implications for sustainability. Teaching will support students' critical engineering agency (e.g., empowerment and identity in engineering contexts) and beliefs about sustainability. Students' agency and beliefs may influence their career choice and expected career outcomes. As a result, more engineering students will pursue careers to solve societal challenges that mitigate and prepare for climate change and its global implications for sustainability."

Engineering identity is important because there is evidence that a lack of identification with engineering motivates students to leave the discipline despite demonstrated technical skills.  This issue differentially impacts female students, who are more likely to perceive an identity mismatch between themselves and engineering.  This is a nationally important problem for a variety of reasons, including strong industrial demand for engineers, research that indicates diverse teams produce more creative results, and concerns of social justice.  This research tests the potential of humanitarian context to address this perceived identity mismatch.  Humanitarian engineering is distinguished by its focus on vulnerable or otherwise underserved populations; for example, this could include infrastructure design and construction in disaster recovery or international development contexts.  There is limited evidence that humanitarian issues disproportionately motivate female students to persist in engineering.  As such, this research empirically measures whether or not humanitarian context supports engineering identity formation in undergraduate students, paying particular attention to gender.  If justified by the research results, this project will create and widely disseminate an open source textbook companion for construction engineering educators at universities nationwide.  This textbook companion will frame disciplinary content in humanitarian context, and will make this curricular innovation available nationwide.<br/><br/>In this research, 650 undergraduate engineering students will experience technical engineering content framed by humanitarian, industrial, or no context.

The co-curricular experiences are often a gateway to much good such as career placement, international travel, and the general accrual of social and cultural capital in engineering contexts. Successful students seem to ""find their way"" and come to belong as members of the organization and ultimately members of a discipline. But these opportunities are not always available in an equitable manner. And although roughly one third of all engineering students participate in these organizations, women and underrepresented minority students face a number of unique challenges regarding their involvement in them. Put differently, it may be fair to say that the same students who stand to gain the most from participating in these Engineering Societies and Organizations are the very students who participate in them at the lowest levels. Therefore, it is critical that stakeholders in student success are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to enact and sustain positive change and inclusive excellence in these Engineering Societies and Organizations. This project therefore addresses two key aims. First, this work explores issues surrounding participation of women and underrepresented minority students in Engineering Societies and Organizations. Gaining a deeper understanding of the way individuals interact with and come to belong within an organization can mitigate barriers to participation and engagement with the profession. Second, this project introduces the Principal Investigator into the field of engineering education research, catalyzing a new and innovative research enterprise at the intersection of student retention, professional development, and organizational change. <br/> <br/>This project offers a holistic view of the landscape of Engineering Societies and Organizations as well as an in-depth understanding of the learning that takes place within these organizations and how that supports or hinders student participation and belonging. To meet the research aim, an embedded case study design is used to investigate the interactions between student perceptions of engineering societies and organizations, the practices and policies of those organizations, and the broader institutional context of the school of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering at Oregon State University. The research takes places over two years, with Year 1 designed to explore student perspectives through interviews and surveys while honing the in-depth data collection approach employed in Year 2. Data collection in Year 2 represents a ""deep dive"" approach, which entails conducting qualitative interviews with faculty advisors and student members; collecting documents and artifacts relevant to given organizational practices and culture (i.e., ways of thinking, knowing, and doing); and conducting ethnographically-informed observations of meetings and events. While the case study methodology offers a rich, nuanced understanding of ecosystem at the research site, the mentoring aim runs parallel to the research, with co-PIs providing scaffolded learning opportunities with a range of qualitative methods. To then meet the mentoring aim, this project leverages a theoretical model of mentoring in which professional development is considered along both Career and Psychosocial dimensions. The project team leverages this model to introduce the Principal Investigator to the field of engineering education, provide support in the conduct of innovative research, and create a network of educators invested in cultivating inclusive climates in co-curricular spaces in engineering. Throughout the project, the Principal Investigator gains exposure to and experience with rigorous engineering education methodologies while also receiving guidance and mentoring regarding ways to apply findings in practice. Taken together, this project enhances understanding of institutional and organizational approaches to broadening participation in ESOs, and empowers a new research enterprise to drive positive educational change through the sustained practice of engineering education research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, higher education institutions have recognized their responsibility in creating a more entrepreneurially minded workforce and have begun to broaden entrepreneurship education beyond the traditional business school model of business fundamentals, case studies, and start-­up companies. In doing so, new approaches to teaching entrepreneurship have been developed, encouraging students to take a more active role in and outside of the classroom. How these aspects of entrepreneurship education influence women's engagement and involvement has yet to be studied. In many instances, these approaches involve a combination of competition and problem-based, team-­oriented learning. Integration of these approaches may influence students in different ways, and there may be differential effects based on gender, race, culture or socioeconomic class. Educational programs are relying on students to self-­select into these highly competitive non-­traditional learning environments. The purpose of this grant is to explore the influence of these new learning environments on student engagement, particularly for women. Results from this research are critical as the nation moves to find ways to develop a diverse, innovative workforce for the 21st century. These results will help higher education institutions understand how women choose to engage in entrepreneurship educational programs and how programs influence women to become involved in innovation after graduation.<br/><br/>This project will engage in a mixed methods study to examine relationships between entrepreneurship pedagogy and women's engagement in entrepreneurship education and innovation post-­graduation. This study will leverage UM Learning Analytics student learning data. Four research questions will drive the work: 1) Who are the students that choose to engage, or not, in particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities and how do these choices differ with gender?; 2) Why do students choose to engage, or not, in particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities, and how do these choices differ with gender?; 3) What are the benefits to students of particular entrepreneurship education activities, and how do these benefits differ with gender? This includes how students perceive their fit within the entrepreneurship program as well as their general perceptions of the program; 4) How do particular entrepreneurship educational opportunities impact the current work of former students, including development of entrepreneurial skills and mindsets, and how do impacts differ with gender? The unique ability to use institutional learning analytics data and large scale alumni surveys to inform targeted in-­depth interviews will offer the most comprehensive look at the impact of engineering entrepreneurship education on gender to date."

The proposed research examines whether a self-reflection exercise in which students consider how they might have done better on the first exam in the class helps students perform better and increases their likelihood of successfully completing the course by helping them understand their performance and form strategies for self-improvement. The proposed intervention builds on recent research that finds that thinking about ""what might have been"" can change behavior and improve future outcomes, as well as an emphasis in engineering education to promote reflection and develop skills for lifelong learning among engineering majors. If successful, this intervention would offer a new, brief, virtually free new tool that instructors could use to boost student success. The project also includes workshops and symposia presented at conferences and universities nationwide in order to train engineering educators in the intervention approach.  The research further improves engineering and STEM education by increasing student participation in research through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, including students from under-represented groups, in data collection and analysis of the proposed studies. <br/><br/>The project leverages cutting-edge theory in social cognitive psychology to explore a novel brief intervention aimed at helping students respond adaptively to challenges. In three studies, the project examines how students' thoughts about ""what might have been,"" (counterfactual thoughts, or CFs), connect to course performance. The first study examines whether students who have CFs are more successful at improving their performance, and the second tests whether instructing students to list CFs improves performance. A third study compares outcomes for course sections using a newly-developed counterfactual reflection intervention to traditional course sections. Following validation of the intervention, workshops for engineering and cognate faculty will promote broader adoption on campus, at universities nationwide, and as part of national engineering and cognate conferences. This research thus  translates the most recent models of regret (Summerville, 2011) to educational applications to identify potential boundary conditions for the effects of CFs on STEM performance, and also offers meaningful contributions to basic research in social psychology and engineering education. The proposal targets broader impacts goals of improving STEM education by boosting student success in engineering, eventually improving primary STEM education through inclusion in curriculum aimed at K-12 teachers, and increasing student participation in research through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in data collection and analysis of the proposed studies. The proposal also targets goals of improving participation of underrepresented groups. Two of the three PIs are female, the majority of undergraduate researchers involved in the project are female, and the undergraduate and graduate student researchers include members of underrepresented racial groups, first-generation college students, and recently separated military veterans. Finally, this research will be disseminated to both the research community and to society at large through workshops, conference presentations, publications in engineering education, STEM education, and psychology journals, and contacts in the popular media."

This REU program aims to increase the skill portfolio of Native American students with research experiences along with intensive mentoring. Participants will be involved in relevant research at Fort Lewis College under the mentorship of FLC faculty; they will later transfer to a traditional R1 REU summer program. These experiences, in addition to the relationships formed at the R1 institutions, will increase the competitiveness of their graduate school application. As a public primarily undergraduate institution with a successful history of externally funded undergraduate research, FLC is uniquely qualified for this program. The college has a robust undergraduate research program with a high quality faculty deeply invested in student success. <br/> <br/>The designated research projects are focused around energy which is one of the more critical factors in both the global economy and ecology. The proposed research aims to further understanding of critical energy and propulsion processes by development of laser diagnostics in combustion, providing critical experimental data to modelers, develop innovative techniques to monitor nuclear reactors and investigate new forms of propulsion, molecular energy transfer and liquid phase molecular dynamics.  The broader impacts of this REU program are twofold. Firstly, participation of underrepresented groups in scientific research is directly increased. The program is designed to ultimately increase the number of PhDs awarded to Native Americans. Native American students will be provided the opportunity to perform undergraduate research while bringing theory into reality. FLC is a Native American-Serving, Non-Tribal institution with an historic mission to educate the nation's Native Americans within a liberal arts framework. FLC ranks 4th in the nation in percent of full-time Native American undergraduates but first in baccalaureate STEM degrees awarded to Native Americans. Secondly, data generated will be disseminated to the wider research community.

Increasing the retention of science and engineering majors from 40% to 50% alone would generate three-quarters of the targeted one million additional STEM degrees. The Transfer-to-Excellence Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TTE REU) program of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) supports retention in STEM fields by offering hands-on research opportunities in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics to increase the confidence and persistence of community college students in their pursuit of science and engineering education and ultimately technical careers. The program's three research areas have been chosen because they are economically-salient, offer many exciting research opportunities, and will resonate with community college students. The nine-week program brings 10 students per year from California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest community college system in the U.S., to UC Berkeley, where engineering faculty will host students in their world-class research laboratories and mentor them in their own research projects. TTE REU participants will also be trained in research protocol, laboratory safety, scientific ethics, and science communications. The program also provides students with transfer advising, and academic and professional development activities to better prepare them to complete a B.S. degree, pursue graduate studies, and succeed in a technical career.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The Transfer-to-Excellence Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TTE REU) program of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) aims to: 1) increase the number of community college students, particularly women and underrepresented minority students, who receive baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering; and 2) expand and diversify the pipeline of future graduate school students. To accomplish these objectives, the TTE REU program builds the research capacity of a diverse body of community college students through hands-on research in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics and encourages them to continue their science and engineering studies and pursue STEM careers. Through generous support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) of the National Science Foundation, REU Site award EEC-1461157, students from California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest community college system in the U.S., will engage in leading-edge research, hosted and advised by the engineering faculty at UC Berkeley. The TTE REU program is integrated with the Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science an NSF Science and Technology Center based at UC Berkeley. The program enables its CCC students to participate in: 1) nanotechnology research on novel nanomaterials, innovative device concepts, and improving device performance in electronics, optoelectronics and sensors; 2) biotechnology research that advances the underlying science and enhances the research tools for advanced biofuels and bio-based chemicals production; and 3) robotics research on how robots can adapt to their environment and human-in-the-loop systems such as autonomous vehicles and tele-healthcare monitoring that integrate sensing, actuation, and control. In collaboration with UC Berkeley's Transfer Alliance Project, the TTE REU program provides academic advising and enrichment programs that prepare community colleges students to be competitive transfer applicants to 4-year colleges. The individualized academic and transfer advising continues for one academic year following the completion of the TTE REU."

Two critical curriculum features of the Computer Science Professionals Hatchery are: (1) VERTICAL INTEGRATION. Instead of being siloed, students at all grade levels will work with and learn from each other on industry sponsored projects. By so doing, the Hatchery will unite faculty and industry professionals to mentor student teams through exciting and relevant projects, fostering a strong sense of community amongst students, faculty, and industry. (2) Short, narrowly focused HATCHERY UNITS will complement regular course work by presenting aspects of specific, foundational concepts or skills--such as communication, software engineering collaboration tools or cybersecurity--that cut across the curriculum, using a unique approach that overlays nimble and lean Hatchery Units with regular courses. The Hatchery Units will also serve as focal points for senior-level capstone teams to work with, mentor, and direct teams at other grade levels.  The Hatchery thus combines the flexible, skills-based approach found in the best of the code schools with the depth and rigor of knowledge best acquired in an academic setting, in a multi-team learning environment that replicates the professional company environment.<br/><br/>The proposed Hatchery structure will enable exploring methods for identifying and addressing moral and ethical issues supporting professional work in computer science. It will research and develop approaches for incorporating analytic philosophical principles of social justice into undergraduate computer science curricula in order to bind moral and ethical responsibilities to social justice, along with technical expertise, revolutionizing undergraduate computer science education and producing graduates who are better prepared for industry as members of agile and diverse development teams. In addition, this project will determine effective practices for affecting positive changes in department teaching culture, and serve as a model for other Boise State departments and for departments at other institutions. The proposed project is capitalizing on three factors that can apply in varying levels to other departments as well. (1) DEEP PIPELINE. The Boise State CS department has developed relationships throughout the learning pipeline from K-12 to industry. Therefore, combining ongoing K-12 projects with work described in this proposal will enable shaping a software development culture from an early age and provide a model of effective transformation of a local software ecosystem.  (2) CULTURAL TRANSITION. In response to industry demand for talent and unprecedented enrollment growth, over the past four years the CS department has hired 21 full-time faculty and lecturers; this makes for an ideal environment to develop methods for establishing desired new cultural norms. (3) PHYSICAL TRANSITION. The CS department is moving to a new building co-located with a large number of software companies, which presents a unique opportunity to design the physical characteristics of the learning environment to maximize industry and student interaction, promote diversity, and encourage teamwork."

This field requires contributions from engineering, biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics with crosscutting concepts that unify the study of science and engineering. In this program, a total of 30 in-service high school STEM teachers, from school districts throughout the Appalachian region of southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia, with an emphasis on serving under-resourced schools and low income student populations, will engage in original research in areas of biomechanics ranging from the gliding locomotion of flying snakes to the design of highly efficient, biological rubber materials, to human balance and fall prevention. The program will run for seven summer weeks on site at Virginia Tech, with teacher faculty interaction throughout the academic year. Each teacher will be paired on a one-to-one basis with a biomechanics research laboratory, conducting research and developing new educational materials. Teachers will work alongside faculty and graduate students, developing new skills towards addressing specific biomechanics research questions using a hypothesis driven approach.<br/><br/>This program will facilitate the development of new educational content that is inquiry-based and focuses on open-ended problem solving, which will address a national need for improving deeper student understanding of fundamental STEM concepts. Research examples from biomechanics lie at the intersection of STEM fields and therefore provide diverse mechanisms for integration of examples and applications in traditionally separated high school courses. The program will train teachers in high-needs rural school districts in Appalachia (Va and WVa). The new educational modules developed collaboratively between teacher and faculty will be made freely available via the web, extending the impact of this program across the country by offering teachers new opportunities to incorporate and adapt interdisciplinary lessons into their curricula.

Knowledge of change processes are familiar to individuals in business and industry, but represent new arenas for engineering and computer science faculty who envision change in engineering and computer science education on their campuses. In this project, faculty are introduced to the knowledge, skills, and abilities of research-based change strategies through the customized Making Academic Change Happen Curriculum.  This curriculum is delivered annually at the Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) Program Investigator Meeting.  After the meeting, faculty receive monthly support through coaching and through the community of change leaders represented in each RED cohort.  The research part of this project uses observations, document analysis, phone interviews and focus groups to determine how the strategies impact the success or failure of each planned change project.  In addition, the formation of a national cohort of change leaders in STEM education enlarges the community of scholars known to be engaged in change practices and can provide important models for change.<br/> <br/>The lack of systemic change within the STEM education community points to an important problem with the approach to change that has been pursued thus far.  Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning.  The project seeks to address this specific problem by addressing the following question:  Can the limits of change in STEM education be overcome by focusing on the individual change agents in terms of their skills and change expertise?<br/><br/>In this project, the Making Academic Change Happen customized change curriculum is being offered at the Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) Investigators Meeting. The work of three cohorts of RED recipients is being tracked as they use the knowledge, skills, and abilities offered in the customized curriculum to enact change on their own campuses.  The intellectual merit of the research work lies in determining - through observation, document analysis, interviews, and focus groups - how change knowledge, skills, and abilities are learned, applied, and contribute to the success of each change project.  The research questions addressed are as follows:<br/><br/>1. What are the baseline skills in change management that RED recipients possess at the start of their projects?<br/>2. What traits/components/characteristics contribute to the success of engineering education change project leaders?<br/>3. How does the MACH curriculum support a change leader's ability to make change?<br/>4. How do change agents empower stakeholders to develop a shared vision for change?<br/>5. How does contents, broadly defined, affect the ability to create and sustain change?<br/><br/>The broader impact of this project lies in the creation of a national leadership cohort for change in engineering and computer science education.

Increasing the diversity in engineering and science is also a profound identified need. According to national statistics, the largest groups of underrepresented minority students in engineering and science attend America?s public higher education institutions and in particular the community colleges. Recent research has indicated that students from these populations who are strong problem solvers, and who understand how to seek assistance and navigate college campuses, are most likely to persist to degree completion. Accordingly, this Research in Engineering Education (REE) project entitled: Research on Innovation and Creativity in Higher education in Engineering and Science (RICHES) for Community Colleges, intends to study a sample of non-traditional college students enrolled in science and engineering programs in urban community colleges to determine: (a) the types and frequency of support practices they utilize, (b) how such practices influence their achievement, persistence and transfer status to four year colleges and universities, and (c) how in turn their propensity for innovation and creative problem solving affect such choices and persistence.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of this research project are: (1) to explore the informal and formal instructional and support practices used with non-traditional students in community colleges to inform persistence, (2) to understand whether such practices are effective in offering non-traditional students a program that enables them to stay in engineering and science majors and to transfer to a four year college or university, and (3) to determine if students? propensity for innovative problem solving influences use of pedagogical practices and ultimately, transfer persistence. RICHES studies an area and group of students that have been historically understudied, community college students in engineering and science, and builds upon the researchers? current studies of STEM pathways and students? propensity for innovation, both of which are research areas recognized as areas that engineering education must cultivate in students. This project has broad impacts because it has great potential to transform instructional and support practice for non-traditional students and those who are typically underrepresented in engineering and science. It contributes to the development and improvement of educational opportunities for the preparation of a new generation of scientists and engineers who will play a critical role in maintaining U.S. leadership."

The project will address this issue from an institutional perspective, elucidating the motivations for and barriers to Native American student recruitment and Native American faculty hiring. Nationwide, the numbers of Native American engineering faculty are extremely small.  According to ASEE data (2012) there were approximately 60 faculty who identified as Native American over all ranks out of a total population of over 25,000. There is significant attrition in the student numbers from undergraduate to graduate education levels. By documenting barriers and catalysts for these students pursuit of doctoral degrees, this project will significantly enhance the ability to increase the diversity of engineering faculties, providing visible role models for Native American students.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will use case studies and interviews to identify and document the impediments that prevent Native American students from earning advanced degrees. A similar qualitative analysis will help understand why students who do earn graduate degrees do not pursue faculty careers. They will create a replicable program model consisting of recruitment workshops to increase awareness of, and preparation for engineering undergraduate and graduate studies. Additionally they will develop and implement a mentorship program pairing Native American doctoral students with a trio of mentors that will support their professional development and successful transition to an academic career. The mentoring program is particularly strong as it incorporates an assistant professor, a full professor and a tribal community mentor who has earned an advanced degree. The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to improve understanding of how to increase the participation of Native Americans on engineering faculties. An ethnically diverse faculty provides a stronger and richer learning environment for all students. The broader impact of this project is in its outreach to Native American students, both pre-college and undergraduate, to increase their knowledge and preparation for engineering studies."

Complexity theorists describe such systems as social networks that are continuously reconstructed as agents within the network interact and influence one another. Complexity leadership theorists develop strategies for managing such social systems to guide this dynamic and to improve the social network and its agents. When effectively led, these social systems can create a shared vision and collective impetus for action, producing new patterns of behavior or new modes of operating. Guided by these principles, this NSF IUSE/PFE:RED project aims to transform the academic culture of the Glenn Department of Civil Engineering at Clemson University so that the faculty and students of the program can better meet the changing societal needs of the 21st century. Few, if any, studies have explored emergent behavior in complex, dynamic social networks and the capacity of these networks to initiate and sustain change in departmental cultures; informed research on the emergence of innovative ideas toward change; evaluated the influence of social networks on innovative capacity of individual members; or provided a useful case for academic departments looking to make similar transformations. Therefore, this study has the potential to make a significant contribution to the literature as it focuses on understanding and communicating the underlying dynamics that explain why and how change occurs in a social system, how continuous change can be sustained, and how similar change strategies can be implemented elsewhere. Validated at Clemson, this change framework is to be disseminated to other engineering departments nationwide, including 60 ABET-accredited civil engineering departments. Hence, the potential societal impacts of the project include a cultural shift in civil engineering education across the nation to produce a new breed of civil engineers capable of creating solutions for 21st-century problems that are posing unprecedented threats to our society.<br/><br/>With the aim of creating a low-cost, scalable, replicable academic change framework informed by complexity leadership theory, this project undertakes three tactics. Tactic 1 involves transforming our curriculum to create new faculty/student interactions and interdependencies via heterogeneous teams to create an environment ripe for the emergence of innovative ideas. This tactic aims to create a curricular scaffold that weaves the coursework both vertically and horizontally through carefully designed, socially-relevant, practically meaningful problem statements with input from project stakeholders and oversight from government partners. This tactic is envisioned to disrupt the status quo and facilitate new forms of interaction among students, faculty, and professionals. Tactic 2 involves transforming the departmental structure and culture to promote innovation through a collective impetus for change resulting from new faculty-faculty interactions and dependencies. The project team uses a soft-wired organizational structure to create conditions conducive for the emergence of complex, dynamic collaborations among faculty to enable innovation and rapid adaptation. Rather than organizing around the solutions faculty can offer, soft-wiring enables the faculty to organize around the societal problems they can solve, leading to flexible, hybrid teaching formats. Tactic 3 involves tactful utilization of discomfort and tension in Discomfort Zone gatherings to create a shared vision for transformation among all engineering departments at Clemson. The intellectual merit of this project focuses on creating an academic culture of innovation and adaptability, which is a prerequisite for sustainable change. The use of complexity leadership theory in an academic setting and the collection of longitudinal data on the emergent outcomes it predicts fill an important knowledge gap in the pertinent literature.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education; the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation; the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems; and the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships; reflecting the alignment of this project with the respective goals of the divisions and their programs."

Every 30 seconds one American will be diagnosed with diabetes and another will suffer a coronary event. These diseases are a burden in underserved communities across the US due to higher prevalence and reduced access to care. Overcoming this human and economic burden is a grand challenge. The vision for the NSF-ERC on Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations (PATHS-UP) is to change the paradigm for the health of underserved populations by developing revolutionary, cost-effective technologies and systems at the point-of-care. Led by Gerard Coté at Texas A&M University in partnership with the University of California at Los Angeles, Rice University, and Florida International University, PATHS-UP brings outstanding expertise to overcome four barriers endemic to POC devices, the need to: be field deployable, have high accuracy, have low complexity, and be affordable. The mission of PATHS-UP is defined by two overarching goals: (1) to engineer transformative, robust, and affordable technologies to improve healthcare access, enhance the quality of service and life, and reduce healthcare costs and (2) to recruit and educate a diverse group of scientists and engineers who will lead the future in developing enabling technologies to improve health in underserved communities.<br/><br/>PATHS-UP will develop two transformative engineered systems to monitor key biomarkers (biochemical, biophysical, and behavioral) of chronic disease: a Lab-in-your-Palm (LiyP) and a Lab-on-a-Wrist (LoaW). The LiyP will be enabled by novel amplification biochips based on nano-engineered single-molecule chain reactions combined with innovative handheld computational imaging and modular spectroscopic instruments. The LoaW will be enabled by unique, ""bar-code like"" biochemical marker implants (grain of rice in size) coupled with a novel wrist-worn spectral imager to visualize the implant through tissue and innovative sensors to monitor biophysical markers (cuffless blood pressure, heart rate). PATHS-UP will also develop innovative algorithms that monitor behavior (diet, medication intake) and predict long-term complications. These enabling technologies are founded on rigorous research in biomaterials, nanoscale systems, sample enrichment, computational imaging, multimodal data integration, and machine learning. Testbeds include one-of-a-kind in vitro phantoms, human subject studies in controlled lab environments, and patients in underserved communities. Developing and integrating these transformational systems into communities requires a multidisciplinary team of engineers, medical doctors, public health experts, industry professionals, and community health leaders. Such broad technical scope and societal outreach go beyond traditional funding sources and require the formation of the PATHS-UP ERC. The team will use participatory design and community engagement to prevent PATHS-UP from merely throwing technologies at these communities, and instead develop technologies that seamlessly integrate into their lives.<br/><br/>Underserved communities in every US state have higher prevalence and less access to equitable healthcare services. Thus, many people in these communities go undiagnosed or are diagnosed late, which can lead to serious consequences. To address this challenge, PATHS-UP will develop advanced technologies to prevent, delay the onset, and manage diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This requires both the development of transformational health technologies and systems and a paradigm shift in how these technologies are integrated into communities. Beyond the obvious societal health impact of the Center?s systems, the students, post-docs, and faculty nurtured by the Center?s intellectual community will also be a significant outcome of PATHS-UP.  The team has a passion to promote meaningful, lasting, engagement with K-College students, especially under-represented minorities and K-12 teachers in our partner underserved communities.  PATHS-UP will provide experiential learning and new engineering/public health curriculum for college students, research experiences for K-12 students and their teachers, and opportunities for participatory design with key stakeholders and community engagement, to promote a rich intellectual environment. The team also has a history of entrepreneurship, having spun off biomedical companies with students, and see building the innovation ecosystem as a vital part of PATHS-UP.<br/>"

This goal will be pursued by supporting innovative interdisciplinary research across the multiple dimensions of brain function and behavior with the ultimate goal of improving the national health in an inclusive environment that promotes the active participation of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The program is led by an outstanding group of nationally recognized faculty mentors from the University of Houston's Industry-University Collaborative Research Center for Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnology (IUCRC BRAIN) to guide undergraduates in addressing grand challenges in neural, cognitive, and rehabilitation engineering. The goal of the REU is to excite, inspire, train, and nurture future undergraduates and to provide research experiences in multidisciplinary projects with clear societal impact to students who might not otherwise have opportunities for research experiences at their own institutions. The site will actively recruit students underrepresented in STEM fields and from non-research institutions. At the end of their REU experience, students will understand the societal impact of engineering, develop research laboratory skills and good engineering practices, obtain hands-on training in research tools, cultivate soft skills, learn about innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering, and participate in social activities that promote a collegial and collaborative atmosphere among student participants, while learning about the community. Research areas will include device development, neural activity measurement, big data, neuromodulation, neurorehabilitation and assistive devices, device interoperability, and human subjects trials. The ultimate goal of this REU site is to advance the national health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is limited evidence that online courses work for the diverse groups of students in engineering classes.  In fact, early findings from other disciplines suggest that virtual instruction exacerbates achievement gaps. This proposal pushes research and practice to better serve all of the varieties of engineering students in three major ways. First, it analyzes underrepresented or high attrition student groups independently, rather than studying average effects for a whole class. Second, it tracks individual student behaviors to better explain differences in student success and better recommend support systems that are tailored to unique students. And, third, it studies undergraduate online and blended learning in five widely varying contexts, including two international sites, to greatly expand the spectrum of tools that can inform undergraduate engineering in the United States, in particular, in a large public university setting. This is achieved through the investigator's study of and collaboration with four introductory engineering courses at diverse institutions. Enhancing digital educational tools to better support unique groups of students, especially those that have high rates of attrition, can fulfill the nation's growing need for a highly qualified and diverse engineering workforce.<br/><br/>Online learning as a policy tool for access to STEM education has abounded - despite the fact that there is minimal or contradictory evidence that online learning, as currently practiced, is an effective instrument for increasing access, equity, or achievement. Research efforts to estimate differential effects are few, and few studies focus on online learning for high attrition post-secondary students in the high need discipline of engineering. The primary goals of this proposal are, first, to carefully examine in situ the implementation, behaviors, and experiences of diverse sub-groups, in particular, high-attrition students, in online/blended environments in undergraduate engineering classes; and, second, to critically evaluate the assertion that online/blended structures are significantly related to achievement for these important sub-groups. This leads to four research questions: (1) Are the estimated quantitative effects of online and blended learning tools and structures (e.g., MOOCs, flipped classrooms) persistent for high attrition learner demographics?, (2) What online structures and behaviors significantly (practically and statistically) predict higher achievement for these students?, (3) What differences in student behaviors and outcomes might be related to or mediated by the institutional context in which instruction is taking place?, and (4) What are the implications for future research design and educational policy? These questions will be answered using a cross-national multi-case approach, applying quasi-experimental methods to four online courses from diverse institutional contexts. In each study, advanced regression techniques are applied to understand how individual students' backgrounds, access of materials, and online behaviors predict achievement. Background study with nationally-and internationally-representative secondary data will contextualize course-specific findings. Qualitative interviews will complement quantitative findings. Results will inform iterative improvements of the four study courses and the PI's first-year engineering course at Purdue over the five-year project lifecycle."

Each year, a cohort of undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in summer research in Power and Energy Systems for Smart Cities at the University of Denver. Faculty members and senior researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will mentor these undergraduate research students. The outcome of the project will be a knowledgeable and trained workforce which would act as the next generation of engineers and thought leaders for ensuring a successful movement toward smart urban environments and addressing the prevailing challenges of energy, economy, and environment. The project team will reach out to a broader range of students with a focus on minority and underrepresented groups, and predominantly undergraduate institutions. The proposed research is expected to significantly enhance the design of future electric power grids via educating the next generation of engineers and leaders in the energy sector. <br/><br/>The University of Denver will host a 9-week summer program which will advance research training for 10 undergraduate students in the area of Smart Cities with a focus on electricity infrastructure. Selected projects, including transportation electrification, electric power resiliency, energy economy, community microgrids, data analytics, and renewable energy deployment will provide students with a comprehensive exposure to current and future challenges in achieving a reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity supply and delivery system, and further offer the required groundwork in cross-disciplinary research on smart urban environments. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in that the research and educational activities will benefit students in power and energy systems, and further provide them with a basic understanding of related topics of economics, decision theory, and mathematical optimization. In addition to revitalizing traditional power and energy systems curricula, the project team also plans to introduce a new special-topic course on Smart Urban Environments. The theoretical and practical implications of the developed results will equip undergraduate students, not only in the REU site but also in a wider geographical area via planned outreach and dissemination activities. The REU experience will improve research skills of undergraduates and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields and further contribute to the U.S. energy independence and national security."

This has been shown to be particularly true in engineering, where some students face additional barriers to their success based on their gender. This project will investigate gender through collaborative, community-engaged research methodologies. In particular, researchers will work with undergraduate engineering students to document engineering-specific experiences. Researchers will prioritize collaboration; together with the students, they will identify strategies which foster positive educational outcomes and share these with engineering departments, faculty and administrators towards the end of advancing the success of students in engineering programs.<br/><br/>The research project has three objectives: (i) to infuse critical theory and methodologies into engineering education research; (ii) to record, examine, and share how undergraduate engineering students of different genders find belonging and success; and (iii) to collaborate with research participants to generate recommendations toward transforming engineering programs into more inclusive and just spaces. Analysis will inform understandings of resiliency in the face of gender marginalization as well as potential subjugation linked to other intersecting identities. <br/><br/>This project integrates critical collaborative ethnography and research justice methodologies, which centralize the principle of the research population being the foremost experts on their own experiences. Power is shifted to the subject community through involving them in knowledge production, analysis, and distribution. Three phases of research include an outreach questionnaire to identify participants and emerging themes, personal interviews, and on-site collaborative ethnographic observation. The initial outreach questionnaire will be distributed nationally through campus cultural groups and other campus communities, peer-to-peer communication, and through engineering departments. A subset (n=20) of the respondents who indicate an interest in further collaboration will be invited to participate in phenomenological interviews that will explore students' experiences of gender in engineering, and experiences with supportive structures that provoke resiliency. Five of these students will then be invited to participate in a five-day site visit. During this period, the student will collaboratively engage with the researchers in ethnographic observation of the student's campus community and support network. In addition, an online community which prioritizes confidentiality and identity protection will be created and all students who completed the initial questionnaire will be invited to join. Here, the student community and the researchers will work together to analyze data, to document community-identified sources of success and perseverance, and to develop recommendations of effective practices, policies and norms that contribute to inclusive, equitable and just learning environments. This project is of significant intellectual importance because it provides a broader contemporary framing of gender and how these identities affect the professional formation of engineers, an area that has received very little attention to-date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radio Astronomy is undergoing a revolution as major new telescopes come on line. This next generation of telescopes requires exceptionally sophisticated signal processing algorithms running in high throughput, heterogeneous computing environments. Implementation of these algorithms and hardware is pushing the state of the art of current DSP techniques.   Advanced DSP algorithms running in commodity devices are a fundamental part of modern life. The signal processing techniques being developed here are also becoming vital across a wide range of areas, including vision-based navigation, remote sensing, robotics, mechatronics, computerized tomography, biomedical engineering, radar and sonar, and signal processing for security.  The experiences gained by the teachers will give them, and through them their own students, insight into the design, development, and implementation of such devices. DSPIRA addresses a confluence of three needs: an industry need for greater public understanding of a widely used technology; science and industry's need to have cross-curricular problem solvers; and the K-12 world's need to integrate engineering principles into their new science standards.    <br/><br/>Over a three-year period this RET Site will offer an intensive six week summer research program and academic year follow-up to a total of 30 STEM high school teachers who will join research teams led by engineers at WVU and NRAO who will provide the RET teachers the opportunity to make meaningful contributions, with authentic involvement, in these engineering research areas.

The overall goal of this research project is to develop and evaluate a virtual mentoring system that uses a group of embodied conversational agents (i.e., think avatars) to mentor underrepresented doctoral students, majoring in engineering and computer science and who are pursuing a career as a college professor. The virtual mentoring system will be designed to expose underrepresented, undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and computer science to the many opportunities available in the professoriate by educating them about the professoriate in general and the engineering and computer professoriate specifically. It will offer concrete guidance on the different routes to the engineering and computer science professoriate. <br/><br/>In the scientific and theoretical literature, research has shown the effectiveness of embodied conversational agents in providing career mentoring functions. The career-related functions typically include sponsorship, exposure, visibility, coaching, protection, and challenging assignments. With this in mind, the proposed project will utilize exploratory, sequential mixed methods to study the overall effectiveness of the virtual mentoring system. Project effectiveness will be measured by using three factors: content knowledge, attitude and preliminary indicators (i.e. applying to graduate programs or summer research opportunities, taking the GRE, etc.). As a part of the research project, the investigator will compare the virtual mentoring system with other traditional mentoring programs.

Knowledge of change processes are familiar to individuals in business and industry, but represent new arenas for engineering and computer science faculty who envision change in engineering and computer science education on their campuses. In this project, faculty are introduced to the knowledge, skills, and abilities of research-based change strategies through the customized Making Academic Change Happen Curriculum.  This curriculum is delivered annually at the Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) Program Investigator Meeting.  After the meeting, faculty receive monthly support through coaching and through the community of change leaders represented in each RED cohort.  The research part of this project uses observations, document analysis, phone interviews and focus groups to determine how the strategies impact the success or failure of each planned change project.  In addition, the formation of a national cohort of change leaders in STEM education enlarges the community of scholars known to be engaged in change practices and can provide important models for change.<br/> <br/>The lack of systemic change within the STEM education community points to an important problem with the approach to change that has been pursued thus far.  Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning.  The project seeks to address this specific problem by addressing the following question:  Can the limits of change in STEM education be overcome by focusing on the individual change agents in terms of their skills and change expertise?<br/><br/>In this project, the Making Academic Change Happen customized change curriculum is being offered at the Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) Investigators Meeting. The work of three cohorts of RED recipients is being tracked as they use the knowledge, skills, and abilities offered in the customized curriculum to enact change on their own campuses.  The intellectual merit of the research work lies in determining - through observation, document analysis, interviews, and focus groups - how change knowledge, skills, and abilities are learned, applied, and contribute to the success of each change project.  The research questions addressed are as follows:<br/><br/>1. What are the baseline skills in change management that RED recipients possess at the start of their projects?<br/>2. What traits/components/characteristics contribute to the success of engineering education change project leaders?<br/>3. How does the MACH curriculum support a change leader's ability to make change?<br/>4. How do change agents empower stakeholders to develop a shared vision for change?<br/>5.

The merit of this work lies in the discovery of whether appealing to grades 5-8 students' personal interests can improve their perceptions of engineering and make them more likely to pursue engineering as a career. The project work involves engaging teachers and students in research-based engineering education specifically designed to promote inclusivity among underrepresented groups. The research team will interview and observe students to better understand how their engineering project work relates to their own personal interests. The immediate impact of the proposed project is measured in the numbers of teachers and students (especially those underrepresented in engineering) that have an opportunity to participate in the interest-driven engineering activities. Results from the research are potentially transformative for how engineering activities are presented in pre-college classrooms. More broadly, the project informs the design and delivery of inclusive engineering activities throughout the nation. <br/><br/>The working hypothesis for the research posits that, by presenting engineering in broader contexts, more students will be able to identify their own personal interests in the engineering challenge - resulting in a more positive perception of engineering as a discipline with which they identify. The research involved in the project will address the following questions. <br/><br/>Does broadening the context of engineering activities: <br/>1. Appeal to more students' personal interests?<br/>2. Empower underrepresented groups (female and minority) to find personally meaningful connections? <br/>3. Lead to more authentic engagement in engineering practices for all students?<br/>4. Improve students' attitudes and perceptions of engineering? <br/><br/>Using a design-based research methodology, the research team is developing this interest-based curricular approach to engineering while investigating how the approach elicits students' interest and authentic engagement in engineering. The research is comprised of three studies: 1) a students' interests interview study that creates a baseline for students' interests, using discourse analysis to identify themes and underlying similarities in students' interview responses; 2) a classroom simulation study that investigates students' engagement in the interest-based curriculum through simulated classroom implementations (in a newly constructed, state-of-the-art research classroom lab space); and 3) a classroom implementation study that situates the implementation and investigation of the curriculum in real classroom settings. Both the classroom simulation and classroom implementation studies utilize a mixed methods research approach to qualitatively investigate the observed engagement of the students, and to quantitatively analyze the relationships between students' demographic/attitudinal data and their participation in the interest-based curriculum. Findings from all three studies will inform the iterative design and implementation of the interest-based engineering curricular approach."

According to the scientific literature, no existing research has systematically examined the gendered organizational socialization experiences of newcomer men and women engineers. Accordingly, this project examines gendered organizational socialization of newcomer engineers. It begins the long-term work of developing processes of acculturation to the engineering profession that are compatible with intersecting non-normative identities, by creating an empirically-supported and engineering-specific model of gendered socialization. The integrated education and research plan is likely to yield a dramatic impact on the field of engineering education by prioritizing the importance of underutilized gender theories, enrolling men in gender research and systems change, and addressing the gap in research on engineering workplaces. Ultimately, this project facilitates greater equality in the socialization of newcomer engineers to decrease attrition from engineering careers and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. <br/> <br/>The objectives of this project are to develop a theoretical model of gendered socialization in civil engineering workplaces and to create research-based interventions for more inclusive socialization. Mixed-methods data will be collected longitudinally over four years, through twice-monthly Individual Socialization Logs (a new instrument developed during the course of this project) and twice-yearly in-depth interviews with thirty diverse newcomer engineers from around the country. Expected project outcomes include identification and characterization of facets of organizational socialization (e.g., practices, processes, relationships and social networks) that are gendered, including how they are gendered intersectionally (i.e., varying across other types of identity, such as race). The research findings and the model created from them are being utilized to create professional formation materials for graduating civil engineering students and civil engineering professionals. Materials are also being implemented nationally and locally in capstone design courses and workshops for engineering companies. Further, this project contributes, simultaneously, to the fields of engineering education, engineering studies, organizational studies, and gender studies."

It is forecasted to grow from $14 billion in 2014 to $335 billion by 2025. Technology has enabled these new platforms to flourish, disrupting traditional businesses and transforming the future of transportation, lodging, computing, energy, and other services. The estimated impact of sharing economy practices on society is striking, directly affecting the lives of more than a quarter of the adults living in the USA. However, the rapid pace of change of new sharing economy technology and practices has resulted in limited understanding of the dynamic interactions of these platforms with the society. The lag in understanding is dangerous as disruptive changes continue to accelerate.  Further, while new technology alters the dynamic interactions in how services are provided and distributed, fair and appropriate regulations of the multiple emerging new ways of providing services has not kept up and adapted.

Unfortunately, there are well-documented challenges in equipping students with the technical and professional competencies for developing user-centered solutions during the engineering innovation process. This project aims at initiating boundary-spanning research for enhancing empathic innovation abilities, which will support user-centeredness during the engineering design process. In this project, the research team will examine how undergraduate engineering students learn empathic innovation over time and how this learning is affected by the nature of community-based learning projects and curricula. The results will provide insights into effective teaching of empathic innovation at the undergraduate level. Guided by the research findings, teaching and learning techniques can be better designed to help students thrive and gain valuable STEM knowledge and skills. Through knowledge dissemination and community outreach, this research will impact multiple stakeholders and institutions. Ultimately, this research will help successfully prepare students for careers in an ever-evolving healthcare industry, which demands a workforce from one eighth of the U.S population, consumes nearly one fifth of the U.S. gross domestic product, and spends about $2.7 trillion annually. <br/><br/>Specific research questions for this project are (1) how do undergraduate engineering students' empathic design tendencies and abilities evolve during an engineering design project; and (2) to what extent, do undergraduate engineering students' empathic designs relate to their engineering innovation on various user-centered smart health engineering design projects. For this research study, the research team will apply a mixed-methods approach. The quantitative measures include individual empathic tendencies, innovative tendencies, empathic design abilities, and team-based innovation potential. Qualitative data collection involves surveys, real-time observations, and videotaping of design review sessions. The team will exploit a suite of statistical analysis methods, including structural equation modeling with latent variables in passive longitudinal designs. The qualitative analysis will employ thematic, content, and discourse analyses. The research team will work with community project partners and domain experts to design and evaluate individual and team-based performance evaluation tasks. This project will inform our understanding of an individual's tendencies in innovative behaviors in relationship to their empathic tendencies, examine how team-based innovation potential is related to empathic design abilities presented by each member of the team, and support current efforts in smart healthcare engineering by better equipping students with the ability to innovate."

These advances also require materials that can perform in extreme environments. These requirements currently exceed the operating limits of available materials. This project envisions an ERC that brings together experts from multiple areas and perspectives to tackle this issue at two levels. The first level is the need to have input from the areas of materials, process, product, and life cycle design research to tackle these challenges. The second level looks at how advanced materials and manufacturing modeling, data analytics, and design methodologies interact in a comprehensive solution. The vision of this planning grant is to establish a joint industry-academia research and innovation team to identify overarching fundamental scientific issues that limit current material capabilities. The goal of this ERC planning grant will be to bring these research areas and approaches together to discover and design advanced materials that can extreme conditions. The proposed ERC would impact society through the development of materials and infrastructure that are durable and resilient, improving the safety and welfare of society against extreme events. <br/><br/>Understanding the behavior of materials and engineered systems under extreme conditions and translating this knowledge into the design of robust and sustainable materials requires a full description of the multi-scale phenomena associated with the interaction between materials and environment. The proposed ERC planning grant will provide a fertile platform to bring stakeholders together through three regional workshops. The scientific and technological problems identified at these workshops will serve to enable a fundamental paradigm shift in materials and manufacturing design for extreme environments. This shift will incorporate computational materials/product design, machine learning, and stochastic approaches. This ERC planning grant will enable comprehensive formulation of a sustainable vision, focus, and ERC structure on the proposed topic. Key material systems and testbeds will be identified, in collaboration with targeted industry partners, professional societies, federal regulatory bodies, and end users. Long-term plans for integrated education, entrepreneurship, technology transfer, and broadening participation activities will be developed.

A previously-funded NSF project found that this mentor-mentee pairing was viewed favorable by both parties and beneficial, particularly by the URM engineering faculty. Because of these results, the investigators proposed to scale, test, and evaluate the approach on a broader scale by creating national infrastructural network partners to help increase capacity to serve a greater number of URM engineering faculty and to introduce tele-mentoring and training models to serve URM faculty who work in remote geographical locations with very little access to mentors.<br/><br/>The project will use a multi-phased phenomenological, mixed method research design to gain greater understanding of the ways in which the URM faculty and emeriti faculty experience the opportunities afforded by the project.

The middle school students participating in this study are enrolled in three separate engineering summer camps: (1) Introduction to engineering summer camp, (2) First-generation engineering summer camp, and (3) Young women in engineering summer camp. The camps are identical in content and are designed with the goal of increasing the understanding of different fields of engineering and engineering careers. Research on interest and identity related to engineering is just beginning to emerge and those studies that exist are very diverse in scope and results. This proposal fills some of the gaps in knowledge that exist, specifically on the impact of engineering summer camps on the identity and interest development of middle school students from three separate populations.

As a result, there is often the assumption that there is a single ""normal"" student experience. However, students from underrepresented or socially marginalized groups often have educational experiences that that are distinct from the mainstream engineering culture. Generally speaking, engineering curricula and individual courses are designed and often taught in traditional ways that do not take into account the many assets that diverse students bring to their engineering studies.  The current system of education does not readily recognize and leverage these experiences in producing new ways of teaching and learning engineering or developing different ways of thinking about how engineers create processes and products for today's diverse society.

The project's goal is to help educators recognize and value a variety of distinct experiences, making the field of engineering more inclusive.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to answer the research question: ""In the varying experiences of students who are underrepresented and/or socially marginalized, what forms of capital, wealth, and knowledge are identified as significant?""  Using a testimonial interview method, the researchers qualitatively investigate recent engineering graduates' experiences of ""unearned advantages"" and ""unearned disadvantages,"" and the relationship of these unearned traits to engineering higher education. The qualitative research approach allows the collection of rich descriptions of participants' experiences to discover if/how differences from the engineering cultural norm may result in models of success that help students persist and succeed. Phenomenographic data analysis and asset-based theoretical frameworks including Community Cultural Wealth (CCW) and Funds of Knowledge (FoK) are used to discover variations in the way that participants experience their engineering education. Through leveraging the expertise of an advisory panel, the project develops the capacity and research infrastructure to develop scaleable mechanisms that can facilitate validation of ""non-traditional"" or ""unexpected"" forms of wealth among engineering educators."

Identifying and addressing key barriers to students' access to and success in engineering have presented vexing challenges for engineering educators and engineering programs across the country. There is growing evidence that cultural characteristics of engineering programs, such as high levels of competitiveness and increasing performance pressures, might lead to exclusionary social dynamics that can discourage some students from persisting in the field. This project draws on the psychological concepts of affect in order to explore individual students' responses to these exclusionary dynamics. More specifically, individual responses to these social dynamics might be informed by a harsh, and often unfounded, self-assessment relative to perceived social or performance expectations. The study will collect and analyze data from students' experiences in engineering programs to develop a foundational understanding of the influences and dynamics that provide the context for experiences related to perceiving a disconnection from engineering. The findings from this research will be used to inform the design of more inclusive engineering learning environments and to develop strategies for students to build resilience and succeed in their engineering studies. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental, theoretical understanding of the role of particular forms of affect in engineering students' professional formation. Some particular affective states related to professional formation may be defined as a pervasive, strikingly painful experiential state related to an overly critical evaluation of self, prompted by a comparison to socially constructed expectations of conduct or performance in a particular cultural setting. This project examines both individual experiences of, and responses to these affective states and the social dynamics that provide the context and prompt the self-evaluation. The research design combines interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to investigate the individual perspective and ethnographic methods to explore the cultural context. More specifically, IPA comprises interviews with engineering students that are analyzed for internal psychological experiences of negative affect in professional formation. The influences and dynamics of such affective states captured at the individual level are used to elicit student experiences in semi-structured focus groups discussion. These focus groups provide an understanding of the social patterns that inform the cultural construction of norms and expectations in engineering programs. The synthesis of both analyses will result in a comprehensive model of how certain forms of affect accompany professional formation in the context of engineering, as understood from both the embodied individual and the sociocultural realities of engineering students. This understanding of these affective states as socio-psychological phenomena provides insights into exclusionary mechanisms and dynamics that may lie at the heart of issues of underrepresentation and attrition in engineering programs."

This study will provide valuable insight regarding how engineering culture and the undergraduate formation of engineers impacts students' beliefs about intelligence, which is an under-recognized factor in their ability to engage in engineering problem solving. This work is imperative to determine how to shift engineering culture to be more inclusive and form engineers that persist in the face of challenges. Findings will also be leveraged to inform the faculty and graduate students delivering courses and presenting at outreach events, resulting in more effective educational programs. <br/><br/>This work will provide a rich characterization of students' beliefs about the nature of intelligence, building on prior quantitative studies. The team will utilize Carol Dweck's well-established framework of Mindset to guide their investigation. A cross-sectional study will collect and analyze interview data to characterize and compare student beliefs about the nature of their intelligence in both the first-year and senior year. When completed, the proposed project will provide insight into students' perspectives on engineering undergraduate culture and how it impacts the formation of their beliefs about intelligence, which are tied to resilience and a commitment to life-long learning. This work could be instrumental in transforming engineering culture and undergraduate engineering education to be more inclusive and encouraging towards productive beliefs about the nature of intelligence. Results from this study will be published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings and journals. These publications will engage the engineering education research community in an important discussion about underlying beliefs that impact the formation of engineers. This project will also provide professional development and mentoring for two professionals, to learn how to conduct rigorous engineering education research. As a result, the pool of individuals qualified to submit future education research proposals will be expanded. Finally, the team's plan utilizes qualified evaluators and member checking in order to assess the success of the research."

The mainstream nanofabrication technologies often require the precise placement of materials at nanometer scale accuracy and thus, can be rather slow and expensive. On the other hand, self-assembly process of nanoparticles allows for spontaneous formation of large-scale nanostructures into certain patterns of configurations to achieve desired functions at very fast speed and low cost. In fact, this is the strategy being adopted by the nature in creating the fascinating structural coloration in many living creatures, such as one found in the birds' feathers. Taking the inspiration from the Nature, we will develop a new design methodology in enabling scalable nanomanufacturing process using the low-cost self-assembly process while simultaneously develop the strategy to control and mitigate the manufacturing defects. The success of this project will improve the robustness of scalable nanomanufacturing process and products and therefore accelerate the transformation from nanotechnology to a broad range of profitable commercial products.  The emphasis on the solar energy will have a notable positive impact on developing green, alternative energy suppliers. This project will also establish a wide range of dissemination and outreach programs, with particular focus on the new hands-on teaching module to attract the attention of students from underrepresented groups to engineering careers and research opportunities. <br/><br/>The intellectual significance of this project to develop a novel robust scalable nanomanufacturing methodology that integrates: 1) non-deterministic design representations that exploit the stochastic nature of bottom-up nanomanufacturing processes; 2) a manufacturing-aware physical modeling strategy that facilitates a direct process-structure-performance data pipeline; 3) a concurrent and robust design framework that allows simultaneous optimization of the structure and process variables; and ultimately 4) nanometrology assisted defect detection and control that combines statistical process control, stochastic model correction, and robust design for a complete suite of cost-effective and robust scalable nanomanufacturing solutions. The methodology will be validated using two testbeds: a) low-cost self-assembled block-copolymer light-trapping coating for thin film solar cells, and b) smart-window coating through hierarchical assembly of nanocomposite materials. A wide range of dissemination and outreach programs will be established, with particular focus on the new hands-on teaching module to attract the attention of students from under-represented groups to engineering careers and research opportunities.

According to the Department of Education, in 2014 over half of engineering related credentials (53%) awarded are in certificate, two-year degrees, or engineering technology, yet there is little understanding of this field and role that these workers play. The purpose of this research project is to develop a greater understanding of the professional identity, institutional culture, and formation of engineering technicians and technologists prepared at two-year colleges. Understanding the role engineering technology education plays and can play in supporting the nation's technical infrastructure and capacity for innovation is essential as engineering scholars seek to enhance the careers of future engineers. This study represents a multi-institutional research partnership between Clemson University, the University of Arkansas, and Tri-County Technical College. This increased understanding will provide insights into shaping targeted educational programs, career counseling, professional development, new policies and strategies to support engineering technology students, promote career guidance, and increase professional satisfaction. <br/><br/>There are three primary objectives of this study: (1) Identify dimensions of career orientations at various stages of professional preparation and map to engineering technology career pathways by surveying engineering technology students, transfer students, and early career engineering technology professionals using Schein's Career Anchor Inventory; (2) Develop an empirical framework, incorporating individual career anchors and the effect of institutional culture, for understanding engineering technology professional formation informed by the Hughes Values Framework; and (3) Develop and pilot interventions aimed at transforming engineering formation systems in engineering technology contexts. This study will utilize a mixed methods research design focusing on both descriptive and correlational analyses of data. Three integrated theoretical frameworks, Social Cognitive Career Theory, Schein's Career Anchor Inventory (online surveys of engineering technology students and professionals), and the Hughes Value Creation Model for Organizational Competitive Advantage (open-ended interviews with students, professionals, and engineering technology institutions/organizations) will be integrated. The use of multiple theories provides an evidence-based framework building new interdisciplinary perspectives and understanding focused on describing and comparing engineering technology pathways and understandings of professional identity and culture. The outcomes of this research study are expected to address and bring awareness to an existing gap in engineering technology and two-year college engineering education research which will impact teaching and learning in both formal and informal settings, reveal new pathways and critical transition points, and impact career preparation and training in the engineering education and human resource development fields.

However, the expected positive impact from increasing the number of engineering graduates will be limited, unless the full capabilities of these graduates are harnessed. Specifically, solving today's complex challenges will require cooperation among experts from many fields. In order for these collaborations to be successful they must harness the diverse capabilities of members of these groups. For that to happen, practicing engineers must exercise technical leadership. Therefore, undergraduate engineering students need to learn how to be effective leaders during their formation as engineers. Unfortunately, engineering educators do not currently have sufficient understanding of how engineering students develop into leaders. This project seeks to improve our understanding of the role leadership plays in the process of becoming an engineer and how to develop an engineering identity in undergraduate engineering students. The project proposes that seeing oneself as an engineering leader requires both the development of an engineering identity in combination with the development of a leadership identity. This project investigates the process of becoming an engineering leader given the central role identity plays in learning.  By understanding the relationship between a leadership identity and an engineering identity, this work will provide a foundation for improving the leadership skills of undergraduate engineers during their time in college using cross-ethnic notions of leadership to serve a diverse student body.<br/><br/>Current approaches in engineering education to develop leadership skills in engineers do little to understand how leadership fits into the broader picture of the heterogeneous nature of engineering work, or the role leadership plays in the formation of an engineering identity. This project seeks to address this gap through a sequential, mixed-methods study resulting in development of a grounded theory of engineering leadership for undergraduate engineering students. The study will answer three research questions: 1) How does leadership identity in engineering students compare to those in other fields? 2) What is the relationship between leadership identity and engineering identity? 3) How do engineering undergraduates define engineering leadership and develop a sense of engineering leadership identity?  This work recognizes that formation of engineers is fundamentally an identity development process. This project combines two models: Lave and Wenger's communities of practice model to understand development of an engineering identity and Komives, et al.'s Leadership Identity Model to understanding how engineering students cultivate a self-concept as a leader. Using these two models, this project seeks to understand how the separate components of engineering and leadership identity converge in the development of a combined engineering leadership identity among undergraduate students. Informed by an analysis of national data, a grounded theory approach will lead to an explanatory model of engineering leadership identity development. As an initial application of the model a series of educational interventions will developed and tested, enabling engineering educators to more effectively train engineering students in leadership."

Engineering education researchers have developed an understanding of the extent to which experiences in engineering impact student identity formation. However, little is known about how engaging in makerspaces impacts the identity formation of undergraduate engineering students, specifically, women and those from underrepresented groups (URGs) (e.g., Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Native Hawaiians, persons with disabilities, veterans, LGBT). URGs have historically been isolated from the profession of engineering and despite decades of commitment to such reform, remain underrepresented in engineering. The institution of engineering has been resistant to change, but the latest developments of university-affiliated makerspaces present an opportunity to innovatively address such change. Makerspace cultures could perpetuate the normative cultures that have persisted in engineering environments. By looking at makerspaces while in their infancy, we can potentially influence the shaping of future makerspace infrastructure and aspects that contribute to the perpetuation of an exclusionary culture. This study seeks to uncover whether investments in makerspaces are supporting the development of another institution of privilege, exclusion, and inequity. <br/><br/>This study seeks to understand how engaging in makerspaces impacts identity formation by exploring the identity construction of engineering students, specifically those from URGs, as they engage in university-affiliated makerspaces. This substantial, nationwide study is novel in that it targets university-affiliated makerspaces across the country varying in institution type, region, and size, where more than half are anchored at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and one is affiliated with a Community College System. This project uses the narrative identity theoretical framework, a robust and transformative way to consider the identity formation of engineering students, where the meaning assigned to experiences becomes a critical part of participants' stories. The narrative research approach enables the researchers to give a voice to students from URGs' voices that typically get lost in translation due to small numbers. This study will give voices to these participants through disaggregation of gender and race/ethnicity and by addressing intersectionality. The primary data from this study are in-depth, biographical interviews where participants are encouraged to share rich accounts of their experiences becoming a maker and becoming an engineering student. Through their stories, the research team is developing an understanding of how students form their sense of self and their identity as they experience an engineering undergraduate program and engage in makerspaces. During analysis, constructed narratives are arranged temporally and then thematically analyzed to uncover emergent themes across narratives to understand the identity development of engineering students who are also makers. Specifically, the research team is seeking to understand (i) the personal growth and identity development stories of engineering students engaging in and experiencing makerspaces, (ii) whether gender and/or race/ethnicity differences exist across such stories and the lived experiences that have led students to develop their identities as engineers, (iii) what such stories reveal about the culture of makerspaces, and (iv) how supports and barriers elucidated through students' stories can inform stakeholder efforts to increase makerspace engagement, particularly for students from URGs. By questioning the impact of cultures in making, this project could potentially impact engineering programs across the country. Enhancing opportunities for engineering students from URGs to develop full identities is one way to potentially impact their persistence and success as engineers. Through this study, insight into making as a pathway for URGs to engineering, a critical implication when considering the country's demographic shifts and near future workforce needs, can be gained. This work may also lend insight into K-12 as well as community makerspaces."

Electrochemical engineering is at the hub of a large number of critical industries, including batteries (for applications ranging from load-levelling to transportation to portable devices), semiconductor devices, electrolytic industries (including aluminum and chlorine production and water electrolysis), sensors, and corrosion protection, to name a few. All of these industries depend on well-trained scientists and engineers with electrochemical engineering expertise. However, despite its immense technological importance, electrochemical engineering is taught in relatively few schools, and is not well-recognized by undergraduate students. CWRU is uniquely positioned to host this REU due to its research strength in electrochemical engineering. The intended direct impact of the REU is to increase the number and quality of students that will seek to continue their graduate studies and future employment in the electrochemical technology arena. Additional, broader impact of the REU will include: (a) enhancing human resource development in a STEM area that is of critical importance to many industries but which is largely omitted from the undergraduate curriculum; (b) generating research results that can have an impact on society as a number of the ongoing projects have important practical implications and involve industrial partners; and (c) The REU will offer participants cultural exchange with international visitors in concurrent programs. <br/><br/>CWRU will host 10 undergraduate students over 10 summer weeks where they will be introduced to the topic of electrochemical engineering through a coordinated program involving research, lectures, and professional development components. This research will be carried out under the supervision of faculty mentors, who are internationally recognized experts. The research projects are all at the cutting-edge, and are associated with ongoing thrusts in the faculty mentor laboratories.  Applications of the research projects include semiconductor processing, batteries development, biosensors, nanomaterials, and environmental remediation. The research will be complemented by a lecture and workshop series on key topics of electrochemical engineering - thereby enhancing the students' appreciation of the connection of their research to underlying scientific principles. Hands-on workshops in data acquisition and computer simulations will provide the students with broader skills, impacting their research effectiveness and future work. A parallel program in professional development, addressing topics such as communications, paper and proposal writing, ethics, and graduate school application, will contribute significantly to the participants' future career success.

Engineering identity, or how one perceives oneself as an engineer, is strongly tied to persistence in engineering training and practice. The three-year research effort will uncover how graduate engineering students perceive experiences of bias and the effect of perceived bias on their engineering identity. This research will help engineering educators understand the ways that perceived bias impacts engineering identity development and measure perceived bias in a large national sample of engineering graduate students. The project will advance the understanding of the obstacles that confront those with the talent and ability to become engineering professionals. It also aims to recognize the key role that engineering graduate education can play in advancing research and theory about how graduate students perceive biases and the ways in which they do (or do not) develop resiliency that buffers their negative experiences. The focus on graduate-level engineering education promises to enrich a general understanding of how experiences with bias may suppress and divert career aspirations, while at the same time providing insight into the specific circumstances of advanced training in engineering professions for those who are determined to endure.<br/><br/>Past research on engineering identity, recruitment, retention, and bias has focused on undergraduate students, leaving little empirical evidence for understanding graduate experiences. In addition, bias research studies STEM fields collectively, whereas we plan to focus specifically on engineering and individual disciplines within engineering. The project is divided into three phases of research, which will: (1) qualitatively explore the lived experiences of minority graduate engineering students' perceived bias and its effect on engineering identity development, via interviews; (2) quantitatively measure the perceived bias experiences and engineering identity of engineering graduate students via a national survey; and (3) qualitatively evaluate the interpretations of data from previous phases and revisit initial participants' experiences of perceived bias using interviews and participant video diary accounts. These three phases of research will be guided by the following research questions: RQ1. How do engineering graduate students conceptualize their own identities, perceive their identities as minority, and experience perceived bias based on those identities and identity intersections? RQ2. How does existing as a minority in a graduate program and experiencing/perceiving bias affect engineering identity? How does intersectional identity affect engineering identity? RQ3. Are there experiences related to engineering identity that mitigate the effects of perceived bias?  RQ4. Can existing identities support engineering identity development? If so, how can they be leveraged to support student persistence, performance, and participation? The goal is to generate empirical evidence that will: identify if/how perceived bias disrupts the development of an engineering identity, offer recommendations for best practices for reducing and mitigating bias, and suggest opportunities for bolstering engineering identity in engineering graduate programs and colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors has been assembled to help prepare a rich pipeline of young engineers that can contribute to current and emerging engineering challenges.<br/><br/>This REU program is expected to yield many tangential outcomes beyond the direct technical impacts to the fields of polymer chemistry, material science, and engineering. First, acquiring fundamental knowledge of polymer chemistry will help leverage it to novel discovery of innovative solutions and will open up a variety of PhD-level research opportunities to the REU students in the future. Also, hands-on exposure to the various interdisciplinary projects will improve the students' ability to communicate to a broader community of researchers and the general public. This is particularly important training to help nurture them into future leaders and educators in science and engineering. This program will also educate the students about technology-transfer issues, entrepreneurship, polymer-based research applications in the private sector, and the leadership skills needed for long-term success by direct interaction with experts and young alumni working in the field. All of these impacts will be magnified with a special focus to recruit students from HBCUs and Hispanic-serving community colleges that are traditionally underrepresented or have limited access to resources.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanobiotechnology is an interdisciplinary science at the convergence of diverse scientific disciplines that leverages the principles and experimental tools from the physical sciences and engineering to facilitate a better understanding of biological systems. However, interdisciplinary research in nanobiotechnology often does not resonate with students, especially undergraduates, due to the limited access and availability of facilities and research programs in the university setting, and the intimidating prospects of mastering multiple disciplines. The overarching goal is to attract and retain underrepresented minority and female students from institutions with limited research opportunities in science and engineering, and prepare them for graduate programs and careers in these fields. To accomplish this goal, the proposed program will provide an interdisciplinary research experience at the interface of nanotechnology and biomedicine to students. Through the program, students will (1) design hypotheses-driven research experiments to solve biomedical problems with engineering tools; (2) develop skills for conducting interdisciplinary research; (3) gain confidence and a sense of self-efficacy to participate in science and engineering research, (4) develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the benefits of interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>UGA will host 10 REU students over a 10-week summer program where they will participate in existing, interdisciplinary research projects that apply nanotechnology to specific biomedical questions. Each REU student will be co-mentored by paired faculty from the nanotechnology and biomedical disciplines on a collaborative research project. In addition to a total-immersion and hands-on research experience, REU students will participate in enrichment activities that include ethics-in-science workshop, weekly presentations on interdisciplinary research, what to expect in graduate school, career workshop, facility tours, and presenting research findings at national conferences."

Through the interdisciplinary research, teachers are immersed in an exploration of the design, fabrication, and application of nanometer-scale components in optical, electronic, mechanical and biomedical systems. The teachers will strengthen their capacity in science and engineering practices through their participation, enabling them to engage their students with engineering concepts within the sciences. Mentored research projects challenge participants to engage in engineering problem solving, and the knowledge gained will help participants develop sustainable curricula and activities in STEM education. RET teachers will return to their classrooms with an improved and relevant skill set to foster their student's interest in engineering disciplines and to succeed with the ambitious educational goals of the Massachusetts Adapted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This RET Site is focused on underserved schools in the greater Boston area with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with 80% of the teachers coming from resource-limited (high needs) schools. Additionally, teachers from schools with high percentages of underrepresented students in STEM and/or high percentages of low-income families will be encouraged to participate. The RET Site will work directly with STEM Nexus from the Greater Boston area and Eastern Massachusetts to target schools and individual teachers that have interest in STEM but have limited resources to implement these activities. This site will also engage local Boston area companies as potential research locations for RET participants and longer-term partners in K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>Integrated nanomanufacturing research is an inherently interdisciplinary intellectual area that is evolving rapidly at the intersecting frontiers of microelectronics, optical science, materials engineering, and biomedicine. Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this RET Site: three broad themes of integrated nanomanufacturing: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine. While engaged in mentored discovery of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants will develop critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. The summer experience involves training sessions, hands-on nanofabrication tool training activities, scientific research in partner laboratories, seminars on classroom integration, and faculty pedagogy discussions. Participants will also be introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a core concept at Boston University to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world. This is the basis of the case study curriculum developed and piloted from the initial RET Site at local schools in Massachusetts, with the renewal promising to disseminate the curriculum widely and develop more focus on physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, students attracted by STEM majors are primarily male and come from non-Hispanic white or Asian populations. The need for appealing to and retaining students coming from non-traditional backgrounds is evident, given the shifts in the U.S. population demographics. As a way to address this issue, the Transfer-to-Excellence Research Experiences for Undergraduates (TTE REU) program of the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) supports retention in STEM fields by offering hands-on research opportunities in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics to increase the confidence and persistence of community college students in their pursuit of science and engineering education and ultimately technical careers. The nine-week program brings 10 students per year from California Community Colleges (CCC), the largest community college system in the U.S., to UC Berkeley, where engineering faculty will host students in their world-class research laboratories and mentor them in their own research projects. These schools will provide a diverse pool of talented future researchers, including low-income, first-generation, and/or underrepresented minority community college students, who might not otherwise have the resources or opportunities to pursue careers in research. Students will be engaged in leading-edge engineering research projects, including nanotechnology, energy-efficient electronics, biotechnology, sustainable engineering, body-centered sensors, mechatronics, greenhouse gas research, and optoelectronics. <br/><br/>The renewal TTE REU program is a comprehensive summer research program that provides: 1) challenging research projects in leading edge engineering research laboratories; 2) counseling to prepare students to transfer to competitive four-year colleges/universities in science and engineering majors; 3) enrichment activities to build students' confidence to continue in science and engineering; and 4) exposure to the diversity of professional career opportunities that apply science and engineering training. The TTE program partners with advisors of Berkeley's Transfer Alliance Project to support its community college participants for another academic year following their research experience as the participants seek to transfer to a baccalaureate program. The main objectives of this renewal program are increasing 1) the number of underrepresented students who will seek and receive a baccalaureate degree in STEM and 2) the diversity of students pursuing graduate degrees in STEM disciplines. To accomplish these objectives, this REU Site will bring together the Center for E3S, UC Berkeley Transfer Alliance Project (TAP), and UC Berkeley engineering faculty. TAP will be a collaborator to provide academic advising and enrichment programs that prepare community colleges students to be competitive applicants to four-year colleges. Each TTE REU participant will be paired with a faculty member and a graduate student or postdoc, who will guide the student in independent research activities, at laboratory meetings, and through one-on-one mentoring meetings. TTE REU participants will also participate in academic and professional development activities to prepare for a baccalaureate degree and career in science and engineering. In addition, all TTE REU participants will be enrolled in a new online mentorship program after their summer research stay ends. This online program will enable a long-term, sustained and formalized mentoring relationship with all participants with the goal of retaining and further stimulating the students' interest in graduate school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many studies over time indicate that when K-12 students have the opportunity to study engineering, their engagement in and understanding of math and science increases. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers want and are required by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to incorporate engineering concepts and capabilities into their curriculum, regardless of the subjects they teach. Yet, only a fraction have completed engineering coursework. The challenge, then, is to expose STEM teachers to engineering research and its potential applications and provide a process for infusing their curriculum with innovative engineering and design concepts and practices. Stanford's new Teaching Engineering Design & Innovation (TEDI) program addresses this challenge head on. TEDI will expose 38 teachers and 10,000 students from school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to the ways science and math content knowledge and Design Thinking (DT) provide solutions to difficult engineering design challenges. TEDI's primary goal is to promote interest in engineering and proficiency in STEM among Bay Area high school students by having teachers practice engineering and use DT to create innovative and exciting curriculum for their students. The major elements of the TEDI model include 8-week teacher placements into Stanford engineering research laboratories; weekly workshops exposing them to a range of engineering disciplines and DT exercises; paid industry placements for teachers before or after a summer at Stanford; and assistance in developing and disseminating new curriculum for use with their own students and others. At a time when over 60% of all California K-12 students are Hispanic, African American, Native American or Pacific Islander groups historically under-represented in STEM and 62% are eligible for free and reduced-price meals, TEDI educates and supports diverse students from some of California's most under-resourced schools to enter and thrive in the STEM pipeline, becoming the scientific and technical workforce of tomorrow and contributing to our nation's economy and global competitiveness.<br/><br/>The RET Site: Teaching Engineering Design & Innovation (TEDI) creates enduring partnerships between San Francisco Bay Area high school STEM teachers, Stanford faculty and graduate students, and industry to focus on critical engineering and design skills that drive U.S. innovation and global competitiveness. TEDI creates a revitalized and retooled teaching ""infrastructure"" that prepares and invigorates high school educators to effectively guide their students toward engineering- and design-related post-secondary study and careers. TEDI's primary goal is to promote interest in engineering and proficiency in STEM among high school students in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The traditional view of the internet is a collection of interconnected computers, tablets, and smartphones by which users can access information through browsers and other programs. However, the recent emergence of IoT radically changes this concept. Now the connected devices are not just computers but also home appliances, wearable health monitors and a very large number of small sensors that can talk to each other. This innovation is rapidly changing the landscape of our daily life. The teacher participants will gain a new insight into this cutting-edge engineering research through the application of scientific knowledge and hands-on experiments, and develop their teaching modules, which will enrich their classroom teaching. The trained teachers will be able to peak students' interest in the practical use of science in modern technologies that are truly relevant to their daily use of networked devices. This cascading educational impact will become the catalyst for seeding scientific interest in young minds through K-12 science classes and raising future scientists and engineers who can advance the IoT digital revolution further. <br/> <br/>Over a three year period, thirty K-12 STEM teachers, serving underrepresented populations in the Seminole, Orange and Brevard county public school districts, in which there are over 20,000 teachers and 310,000 students, will be recruited and participate in an eight week summer research program and a one week Train-the-Trainer workshop in the following summer.  This program will create competent teacher trainers who will ensure quality pre-service and in-service teacher education, by providing multidisciplinary experiences that are relevant to the current technical development in IoT devices and systems. The Train-the-Trainer model will be implemented by which teachers will become effective mentors and facilitate knowledge acquisition and application in K-12 educational settings for other teachers. To bolster the Train-the-Trainer model the ""Universal Design for Learning"", a framework for the design and implementation of instructional materials will be utilized, meeting the needs of individuals by proactively circumventing curriculum barriers. The participants will rotate to four different laboratories, where they will learn about the practice of engineering in various disciplines under the guidance of faculty mentors. Teachers will develop teaching modules to deploy in the classroom in the form of lecture notes, demonstration kits and prototypes. This RET program will give teachers learning opportunities to explore the practical use of science for engineering applications, and provide a context in which students in their classroom can test their own scientific knowledge as they recognize the interplay among science, engineering and technology. The program findings will be presented at regional, national, and international conferences, and published in educational journals."

The participating institutions have been carefully selected for their combined strengths in Pharmaceutical Engineering and in Nutraceuticals (Rutgers), Organic Nanomaterials (NJIT), and Industrial Pharmacy and Systems Engineering (Purdue) and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing (UPRM).  Our main outreach institution, CCYN, provides additional strengths in particle synthesis, as well as further involvement of minorities through its LSAMP and AGEP programs.  <br/>Intellectual Merit:  Product and process design in organic composites is mostly empirical due to the underlying complexity of processes and products.  The intellectual goal of C-SOC is to transform this technology domain into a science-based enterprise.  In order to develop a predictive understanding of the effects of material properties and process parameters on the functionality and performance of organic delivery systems, interconnected research projects will be organized into three thrust areas:  (1) Materials Synthesis and Functionalization, (2) Composite Synthesis and Characterization, and (3) Manufacturing Science.  Research will focus on developing the means for systematic materials functionalization and structuring, rigorous process scale-up, process optimization and control strategies that will revolutionize product and process design and development in the target industries.<br/>Broader Impact:  Improvements in this area will result in reduced cost and more consistent and reliable manufacture of biocompatible products as well as science-based, faster development of new products, and a more competitive US industry.  Impact will be maximized by focusing on six technology test beds (integrated manufacturing platforms) that focus on multiple methodologies for synthesis of functionalized materials and finished products.  To maximize technology transfer, the interconnected test beds will be organized into three materials development programs that cut across thrusts while following the typical product life cycle of the target industries:  (1) Engineered Particulate Ingredients (crystals, precipitates, polymer nanoparticles) (2) Granular Micro-Composites (coated porous granular matrices), and (3) Macro-Composites (tablets, wafers, pellets).<br/>Education, Outreach:  Modernization of academic programs in relevant areas at all levels will be achieved via educational programs, both formal and experiential, based on a flexible system of 1-credit modules that  provide innovative content in a scalable, portable format suitable for a wide variety of audiences ranging from HS teachers to graduate students to continuing education participants.  Graduate education will be enhanced by the development of a 15-credit graduate training program in structured organic composites.  Impact at the Undergraduate level will be accomplished by the organization of minor and certificate programs in Engineering, Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Food Science, REU activities, a student exchange and summer internship programs.  K-12 outreach will focus on a structured 4-stage awareness development program including a RET program, a summer research internship (Camp Pharma), and a traveling ""lab on wheels"" that introduces kids to engineering using demonstrations delivered in both English and Spanish.<br/>Diversity Development:  The aforementioned programs will synergize efforts that specifically target individuals from historically underrepresented populations (e.g. Midwest Crossroads AGEP, The Puerto Rico LSAMP).  Strong minority access is also given by UPR participation, and by a comprehensive plan for minority recruitment and retention, including exchanges with minority-serving institutions, internship programs, advertisement campaigns in appropriate college newspaper.  Many of the proposed ERC faculty members come from historically underrepresented populations and will serve as mentors and role models.<br/>Industrial Participation:  Industry will participate in the core research program using the multi-tiered memberships promoted by NSF.  Approximately $1 million in (14) cash memberships has been committed to the proposed center.  The ERC will also host company-specific research projects; additional cash funds also in excess to $1.6 million have been committed for this purpose by 24 companies.  Active industrial participation in educational activities will be promoted  by implementing internship programs and industrial participation in teaching activities, research, and mentoring.  <br/>"

This REU program is designed to increase students' interest in UAV technologies by means of first-hand experience on UAV research with direct mentorship by faculty advisors from various departments within the CPP Colleges of Engineering and Science.  <br/><br/>This REU Site offers undergraduates, in collaboration with CPP faculty and graduate students, opportunities to conduct research during a 10-week summer program, on state-of-the-art technologies and advanced research projects in UAV flight dynamic and control, computer vision, artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and robotics. In addition to their research, students will participate in weekly research seminars, research meetings, and professional development seminars. The seminars will include topics such as literature review, writing a scientific paper, improving written and oral communication skills, technical presentations, graduate education, career paths, resume building, and ethics in science and engineering. The 10-week program will also include outreach activity. The students will give presentations on UAV technologies, engineering, and computer science to K-12 students at local schools. This will enhance students' communication skills, allow them to see the broader implications of their research, and see how they can positively impact society through research. The discoveries made during these collaborations will be communicated to the broader scientific community via publications and presentations. <br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."

The research achieves a broader impact by enabling early understanding of engineering concepts through literature based on story board depictions from an engineering perspective as well as computer simulation games re-enforcing the engineering design process. By studying the impact of these stories in the classroom, new literacy tools and educational computer games that positively transform the way children think about engineering as well as our approach to STEM education can be developed. Engineering provides a meaningful situational context for teaching science and math and results from this study engineering to be a necessary component for effectively teaching science and math in the early years. Once this outcome is realized, results from this study can serve as a catalyst for the development of new pedagogical strategies for engineering education and enable children's book authors and game programmers to consider new strategies for learning for this young population of students. In this way, the conceptual understanding outcomes (content and vocabulary) are sustained in later years and ultimately improve achievement in engineering.<br/><br/>This project examines the following research questions: What is the impact of engineering-centered literacy activities on K-2nd grade culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) student learning and engagement in engineering content? How does participation in academic conversations impact sustained engagement in complex engineering tasks? Does the impact vary by student characteristics (language background and achievement level)? To what extent can engineering-centered simulations facilitate requisite science and mathematics concept learning that support the engineering process. What simulation design features maximize this learning for K-2nd grade students? How does engagement with simulations impact students' academic conversations? Specific objectives are to use a single case study approach for studying: (1) engineering design centered computer simulation games and engineering-focused books to promote student engagement and learning; (2) examine growth in instructional effectiveness; (3) research methodologies for improving student engagement; and, (4) analyze improvements in student concept learning. This is among the first studies to address the learning and engagement impact of children's story-book literature that is centered on engineering principles. With an understanding of these best practices, authors can more effectively design STEM content rich books for this age group. An understanding of the mechanisms that advance learning through computer simulation games are also being developed. This understanding is a first step toward developing additional individual and/or group activities. These best practices are examined across cultural and linguistic boundaries to better serve all populations."

First, students who have the desire and aptitude to become accomplished and productive engineers are abandoning the discipline in startling numbers. Second, students who graduate are frequently not prepared for the realities of their chosen profession and are switching careers at alarming rates. A team of educators at Colorado State University propose a new organizational model that looks at the undergraduate electrical and computer engineering (ECE) degree as an integrated system, breaking down the barriers inherent in higher education structures and implementing novel pedagogical approaches that allow students of all backgrounds to see the utility of their knowledge and connections to professional practice. At the pedagogical level, the new approach combines rigor and flexibility in engineering education to improve student efficacy and content knowledge integration through building communities of learning and practice. At the organizational level, the transformational approach aims to energize faculty to collaboratively weave important knowledge and application threads throughout the curriculum, while utilizing a new learning model that connects disparate anchoring concepts. Whether demonstrating the relevance of content through research, labs, or hands-on projects, the ECE faculty will work as a multifaceted team, ensuring that every educational component gives consideration to the big picture, while simultaneously instilling a deep knowledge of the discipline. Colorado State's approach is expected to reverse the attrition trend in engineering education and fill the engineering pathway with motivated students of diverse backgrounds. These students will have the mastery of fundamental engineering knowledge, while being ready and excited to apply their knowledge to real-world applications. The pedagogical and organizational innovations provide a broad framework for transformative and sustainable changes in engineering departments, which are necessary to produce professional engineers of the future. Moreover, the approach builds a community of universities, community colleges, and industry partners for wide participation of effective teaching and learning. CSU's approach will propel a new engineering workforce that generates superior ideas, products, and services, ultimately contributing to the nation's economic vitality and global competitiveness. <br/><br/>Colorado State's proposed model incorporates transformative innovation in engineering education that yields an inclusive environment that is characterized by rigor and flexibility. The new approach utilizes learning studios with modules that build on the concept of ""nanocourses"" and emphasizes knowledge integration - which is a learning model that is well grounded in pedagogy and supported by education research. CSU's efforts will span the entire undergraduate electrical and computer engineering experience, with special attention to the critical technical core of the middle two years. While area-specific learning modules have been in existence for years, such modules are usually supplements to the core curriculum and do not typically cover fundamental subjects vital to comprehending abstract topics; nor do they stitch together anchoring concepts to lay the groundwork for real-world applications. Key to the new approach is its: latitudinal knowledge integration, which will be used to link fundamental concepts and illustrate the utility of topics using applications students are familiar with (e.g., the smartphone, digital camera, and high-speed internet), consonant with research recommendations from the cognitive sciences. Furthermore, the pedagogical innovation of the new approach is accompanied by organizational redefinition of roles within an engineering department - based on established behavioral science principles coupled with rigorous evaluations and research methods specifically developed for this project. The research findings will advance theoretical development of engineering education and organizational development frameworks, while also providing practical case-study examples of change interventions for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Furthermore, successful porting of organizational science principles to higher education may provide validity evidence that higher education can be compared to other organizations, such as those found in private industry."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>This project will develop the foundational plan of an Engineering Research Center (ERC) to form a unique, transformative, and transdisciplinary team that will create, define, understand, and teach the science, technology, ethics, regulatory framework, entrepreneurship methodologies, and societal impact of the rapidly evolving integration of humans and technology. Communication and technology revolutions, such as radio, television, and the internet, have resulted in profound societal changes. The human, however, has basically remained external to the system with technology serving only as a tool. We propose that a conceptual shift toward symbiotic integration of the human with technology will bring the next societal transformation leading to a more connected, global society with new operational models of work, anthropocentric technology, and human-human interaction. We envision a tech-plus, transdisciplinary team of scholars, entrepreneurs, ethicists, and members from partnering institutions (including companies) that will perform convergent research at a new frontier of human incorporation of technology into a sense of self, i.e. a symbiosis between humans and technology. The core is a shift from the current techno-centric approach, where human and technology are separate, to a human-centric technology development paradigm. We seek to shift the societal dialogue from that of a battle between humans and technology (such as artificial intelligence and robotics) to a more productive dialogue of merging the best of humans and technology for the mutual benefit of both.  Symbiotic incorporation of technology requires new interfaces to the human that add multiple sensory connections beyond current audio and visual inputs. This symbiotic relationship will augment human capability with those of technology and networked systems. New, symbiotic technology will radically change the future of work, human learning, human-human interaction, human networks, human health, human capability, and society overall for a safer, more prosperous future. The overall goal is to refine the model sufficiently to be compelling for a sustained research and development effort in an ERC for merging Humans, Machines, and Networks through Functional, Symbiotic, Integration On Neural Systems or an ERC for Human Fusions. Prior significant research shows that the core need of incorporation of technology into a human's sense of self, requires 1) a sense of agency over technology and 2) multi-sensory synchrony with technology. <br/><br/>Strictly, this project is a planning grant to develop the ERC structure and processes that will rationally evolve the relationship between humans and technology. Methods from the Science of Team Science (SciTS) will be employed to establish relationships between committed, energized stakeholders in this new, transdisciplinary effort in human-technology symbiosis and a strategic plan to grow and establish sustainable research capacity. The objectives of the project are to 1) assemble the expertise to define the transdisciplinary, tech-plus framework; 2) develop a process and the collaborative tools for the sustained, focused development and study of the new human-technology paradigm, and; 3) establish a central point of engagement for stakeholders and external communities. This project will foster a new dialogue regarding the evolution of the human-technology relationship. Tangible outcomes from the planning process will include social media networking platforms, a central collaboration and dissemination website, and surveys to gauge stakeholder commitment to and refinement of the symbiotic model of human-technology evolution. Successful realization of a symbiotic human-technology paradigm requires a transdisciplinary approach to address significant scientific, technical, ethical, and social challenges. The transdisciplinary model of the ERC for Human Fusions has a technical core addressing anthropocentric technology, multisensory human interfaces, and connection infrastructure. Expanding around this are disciplines to address ethical questions of symbiotic technology, regulatory frameworks to support the ethical principles, entrepreneurial models to introduce new technology, and sociology to understand how symbiotic technologies impact society. These are highly integrated such that each is integral to the development and understanding of the other. The potential ERC will provide leadership, intellectual resources, the establishment of world-class facilities for responsible and effective scientific discovery, technological innovation, and resources in the new symbiotic sciences for education, research and development and translation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also an area that integrates disciplines, generating a highly creative environment that breaks down traditional academic silos. At Northwestern University, nanotechnology is recognized as one of the pillars of excellence, due in large part to the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN). This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site for Nanoscale Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, hosted by the IIN, will provide diverse cohorts of undergraduates with meaningful, goal-oriented, laboratory research experiences for a 9-week period over the summer. The foundation of scientific and technological progress is an educated and motivated scientific workforce. Research is a valuable experience in critical thinking and skill development for undergraduates, and summer research experiences - that are not fragmented by classwork and extracurricular obligations - are especially valuable for exposing undergraduates to realistic day-to-day operations of a research lab, and for allowing them to engage deeply in a single challenging research project.<br/><br/>During the summer IIN will host a unique program in an intellectually stimulating environment that provides research opportunities in Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, Physics, and several Engineering disciplines, all connected through their focus on nanoscience and nanotechnology. This REU program strongly emphasizes the recruitment of undergraduates from institutions where academic-year research opportunities and/or resources to conduct scientific research are scarce, in order to increase the representation of all ethnicities, genders, and socioeconomic groups in the STEM workforce. Each student will be mentored by a faculty member and a graduate student team within a framework that moves from guided supervision to independent work as abilities allow. The students will problem solve and contribute to the development of new tools, materials, and methods while exploring nanoscale and atomic-scale systems, phenomena, and devices. The cohort will be strengthened by weekly meetings/seminars, field trips, social activities, and shared on-campus housing. The program will include an interactive public speaking workshop, one-on-one technical writing sessions, and access and training on state-of-the-art instrumentation. Participants will present their findings at a Closing Symposium and in a written technical report.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is clear that new educational strategies need to be developed and implemented in order to diversify the engineering profession. This project takes a fresh approach in an effort to demonstrate the role students' individual identities (i.e., intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, ability, sexual identity, language, etc.) play in helping or hindering success in undergraduate engineering and computer science programs. The project's results should reveal tangible, practical themes which point to why some students pursue, persist, and retain in the engineering profession while others do not. Research findings will provide a foundation for future work focused on the identification, design, and implementation of curricular and programmatic transformation in engineering and computer science, towards the end of creating equitable, just educational environments that intentionally recognize the various aspects of students' identities, recognize the importance of social, economic and political power and its differential, stratifying impact on lived experiences, and affirm students across their differences.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that students who identify along social categories that are centered in US culture (e.g., white, able bodied, heterosexual, male, Christian, socioeconomic affluence) will have a higher sense of belonging and self-efficacy as they progress through their undergraduate engineering programs, relative to those who identify with other groups. Both sense of belonging and self-efficacy have been shown to be positively correlated to retention and to professional identity formation.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>This proposal is focused around developing an Engineering Research Center to advance ""smart"" public service infrastructure, including water, mobility, power and food, that is locally distributed (units located at or near point of use). The development of these localized public service infrastructure (distributed systems) will enable automation for improved efficiency.  These new distributed systems will interact with existing centralized (a single unit serving a large metropolitan area) systems to create hybrid systems. The ?smart? feature involves adding sensors and controls to connect these systems, making them operate in a more efficient manner.  The planned Center will consider the fact that much of the U.S. public service infrastructure is currently in need of replacement. We aspire to both create and demonstrate new methods and state-of-the-art technologies that are more flexible, efficient, secure and responsive to the needs of those who rely upon them. Furthermore, a centerpiece of our proposed Center is to implement new approaches to governance, management, financing, decision-making and public sector engagement around the selection, management and use of public service infrastructure.  If our planning activities are successful, this Center will transform the landscape of public sector infrastructure toward more efficient resource utilization; increased public understanding of and engagement with public service infrastructure; and create educational approaches that will produce a new generation of engineers, managers, scientists, public service representatives and engaged citizens. <br/><br/>The purpose of this grant is to facilitate deeper planning for an Engineering Research Center concept around Regenerative, Restorative and Resilient Community Infrastructure Systems (R3CIS). The proposed Center's goal is to accelerate innovation, development and adoption of cyber-enabled distributed technologies. Additionally, the proposed Center aims to support institutions (such as government, management, and financial) that transform regenerative and restorative infrastructure systems so that it enhances the well-being of public and planetary health. The proposed Center concept specifically focuses on novel infrastructure systems that support the public-sector (water, power, mobility, food). This focus will shift public sector infrastructure planning from being service-oriented to resource management-oriented. This shift will enhance efficiency, increase resilience, restore city regions, and improve the institutional structures that facilitate the equitable distribution of resources to achieve healthy communities.  Further, it puts decision science methodologies up front to ensure the work is stakeholder-focused and science-based to meet the needs of communities.   In preparing to write an ERC proposal around this concept, this planning grant focuses on several parallel activities: create and engage a stakeholder commission for two test-beds (Detroit Metropolitan Area and Rocky Mountain Front Range) and a science advisory board; define a list of integrated public service infrastructure technologies and refine and prioritize that list during the planning year; develop a strategic plan for our Center concept and, as part of that effort, create a road-mapping process in which we lay out details of the first two years of the proposed Center.  The road-mapping process is designed to be revisited annually to identify priorities for the coming two years, with an emphasis of putting ideas into practice; identify and work closely with those community partners from testbed communities and who work at the national level advocating for communities.  We want to engage community members from the testbed locations from the start and ensure their participation in Center visioning; identify the education and outreach elements that emphasize the integration between academia and practice and create the plan for their development that will be part of a future Center proposal; nurture and further develop core plans with foreign partners.  Together, these activities during this planning year will allow our team to develop an integrated system of systems research vision, detailed plans and partnerships for testbeds, a workforce development plan, methodologies for the innovation ecosystem, and identify additional collaborators and up to one additional institution that can fill expertise gaps.  The broader impact of the proposed Center is that it will ultimately increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology.  Our methods will enhance multi-stakeholder partnerships that include academia, industry and other groups.  Using a stakeholder-centered model, we believe our work will improve the well-being of individuals in society. Importantly, this novel approach will allow for enhanced equity across diverse populations and help to reduce environmental injustices in the placement, deployment, use and management of public-sector infrastructure services. The improvements made to critical public-sector infrastructure will improve national security and increase the economic competitiveness of the U.S.  Therefore, the planning grant will create the framework for being able to achieve all these broader impact elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Industry, military, and academic scientists and engineers look to employ UASs to support and advance increases in agricultural productivity, monitoring the health of forests and oceans, the success of search and rescue efforts after disasters, robotic deliveries, and defending the nation's citizens. Students interested in STEM careers will likely encounter or work with systems that utilize UASs, both in school and in their work, as the market and range of applications continue to grow. UASs also provide a potentially fun and creative way to approach, learn, and work with concepts and design aspects of several critical STEM subjects including math, mechanical and electrical engineering, physics, and computer science. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site program aims to provide teachers with research experiences related to UASs, particularly commercially available quadcopters (4-rotor drones) and their applications, and to assist the teachers in developing curricular materials that connect topics in math, science, and technology classes to real applications. The project will connect teachers with university researchers, education professionals, and industry engineers to explore how drones work, the math and science involved in controlling a drone, and constructing a drone to carry payloads, survive crashes, and ignore interference from cell phones, radio-controlled vehicles, cell towers and other radio frequency sources. Providing teachers with training in STEM subjects through research experiences and assistance with the development of UAS-based curriculum elements will allow teachers to connect material to realistic problems to better engage students and help the teachers pass along problem solving skills to their students. This, in turn, better prepares students for the 21st century business and technology environment which strongly values the ability to solve problems effectively and efficiently, and achieves a STEM aware and capable workforce.<br/><br/>The University of Tulsa (TU), in partnership with Tulsa Regional STEM Alliance (TRSA), will conduct an RET Site based on the operation and application of quadcopter UASs, addressing the major fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. The Site will invite 10 Tulsa-area high school teachers each year for a period of two years to conduct research and curriculum development activities at TU for six weeks during the summer months. The program will also engage Tulsa Technology Center (TTC) for teachers and for follow-up activities. TU and TRSA will partner to disseminate the results of activities, including curriculum modules, activities for follow-on quadcopter-based STEM camps, program evaluations, both locally and nationally. State and local industry will benefit from students trained in problem solving and STEM disciplines and better prepared to fulfill high-skill, higher paying jobs.

The project is based on an emerging successful broadening participant program that aims to increase the representation of Alaska Natives in engineering. The Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program (ANSEP) is comprehensive model program that currently works with 2,000 students. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the program was completed in 2015 by the Urban Institute. They found that the ANSEP model offers important lessons for other science, technology, engineering and mathematics education programs for underrepresented minorities, especially in its engagement of students from middle school through graduate school. Alaska has one of the most expensive K12 education systems in the nation and consistently ranks at the bottom for performance at all levels. Many of the conditions and student outcomes are similar to those found in under-served communities across the nation including inner cities, the Mississippi Delta, rural America, Appalachia, and Indian reservations. ANSEP has catalyzed a change in the educational paradigm and established a comprehensive set of components that extend from 6th grade to graduate school. The aim is effecting systemic change to improve the recruitment, progression, and advancement of Alaska Natives in the engineering workforce. The program has leveraged NSF support to sustain and institutionalize the various programmatic components through partnerships with more than 100 industrial firms, philanthropic organizations, federal and state agencies, schools, colleges, and universities who provide resources, advocacy, research opportunities, and internships. <br/><br/>Seven teams from a variety of institutional types will be selected to participate in the dissemination conference. Teams will include a cross-section of higher education, secondary school, industry and philanthropic partners. Participants will be solicited from targeted institutions where a replication of the work will have the greatest impact and highest likelihood of success. The conference is designed to be hands-on and experiential. Teams will learn from panels of ANSEP partners, students, and alumni, and will participate in and observe activities associated with the ANSEP programmatic components. Each team will develop a customized program based on the nuances of their local contexts."

The course will use an educational style called ""learning CS by making"" where students will create a CS-based product (such as a robot) and understand the concepts that make the product work. This hands-on approach has the potential to motivate diverse student populations to pursue higher level CS courses and related disciplines during and after high school, and to join the CS workforce, which is currently in need of more qualified workers. <br/><br/>ALCSE-INCLUDES Launch Pilot will unite the efforts of higher education institutions, K-12 officials, Computer Science (CS)-related industry, and community organizations to pursue a common agenda: To develop, implement, study, and evaluate a scalable and sustainable prototype for CS education at the middle school level in the Alabama Black Belt (ABB) region. The ABB is a region with a large African-American, low-income population; thus, the program will target individuals who have traditionally had little access to CS education. The prototype for CS education will be piloted with 8th grade students in 3 ABB schools, using a set of coordinated and mutually reinforcing activities that will draw from the strengths of all members of the ALCSE Alliance. The future scaled-up version of the program will implement the prototype in the 73 middle schools that comprise ALL 19 school districts of the ABB. The program's main innovation is to provide CS education using a makerspace, a dedicated area equipped with grade-appropriate CS resources, in which students receive mentored and structured hands-on activities. The goal is to engage ALL students, in learning CS through making, an evidence-based pedagogical approach expected to reinforce skills and promote deep interest in CS."

It is critical for our economic and social health, as well as national security, to maintain a globally competitive computing workforce. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations (12% from 2014 to 2024). In order to keep our nation on the cutting edge of technology, we must retain more domestic students in computing programs.  A 2012 report on undergraduate STEM education from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) cites ""uninspiring"" introductory courses and an unwelcoming atmosphere from faculty as major factors contributing to attrition. The project at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) aims to address the PCAST findings by re-imagining what it means to learn, whose knowledge counts, and what counts as knowledge in the context of Computer Science (CS).  The UTEP model transforms faculty into change agents and fosters the development of positive student identities early in the curriculum to impact students' trajectories in CS and beyond. As important, the acquired skills and knowledge from the proposed effort are expected to transfer to other subjects in students' studies, decrease students' time to degree, and strengthen their preparedness for entry into the computing workforce. Further, the development of inclusive environments with members who value multiple and diverse experiences and perspectives is needed to address global challenges and opportunities.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to cultivate socially conscious connectedness among students, faculty, and industry. This will be accomplished by expanding a curriculum centered on heightened social interaction driven by an understanding and appreciation for the cultural contributions of diverse students to CS in a globalized world.  The project objectives are to (1) transform the CS curriculum (i.e., content, pedagogical principles, social interaction, and faculty beliefs) to one that builds students' identities as computer scientists and considers societal and global contexts in problem solving; and (2) develop a climate of connectedness through a shared sense of purpose among faculty focused on establishing cultural competence and inclusive environments.  The outcome will be twofold:  (i) a program of study that motivates, connects, and immerses students from diverse backgrounds in the profession throughout their plan of study; and (ii) faculty with deep cultural competence who use professional practice-based learning to foster systemic change. The resulting model transforms CS teaching and learning through deep change to curriculum grounded in social consciousness, cultural competency, and practice informed by the department's unique expertise and experiences as a Hispanic-serving institution and leader of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI).  The theoretical underpinnings of the project are framed on theories of learning informed by situated cognition, derived from sociocultural theory. In order to generate new knowledge about a process-oriented approach to deep educational change in CS, the effort includes ethnographic research on the change process and the education process paying particular attention to diversity, inclusion and professional practice."

It is clear that new educational strategies need to be developed and implemented in order to diversify the engineering profession. This project takes a fresh approach in an effort to demonstrate the role students' individual identities (i.e., intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, ability, sexual identity, language, etc.) play in helping or hindering success in undergraduate engineering and computer science programs. The project's results should reveal tangible, practical themes which point to why some students pursue, persist, and retain in the engineering profession while others do not. Research findings will provide a foundation for future work focused on the identification, design, and implementation of curricular and programmatic transformation in engineering and computer science, towards the end of creating equitable, just educational environments that intentionally recognize the various aspects of students' identities, recognize the importance of social, economic and political power and its differential, stratifying impact on lived experiences, and affirm students across their differences.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that students who identify along social categories that are centered in US culture (e.g., white, able bodied, heterosexual, male, Christian, socioeconomic affluence) will have a higher sense of belonging and self-efficacy as they progress through their undergraduate engineering programs, relative to those who identify with other groups. Both sense of belonging and self-efficacy have been shown to be positively correlated to retention and to professional identity formation. Because relational and structural power accrues to those who most closely approximate the mythical norm, those who do not align with these social categories may be compelled to assimilate or to withhold or even deny integral parts of their social and cultural identities as a means to successfully navigate engineering culture. This is referred to as ""identity severance"" and it is hypothesized that it is negatively correlated to persistence in engineering education and practice. Achieving the above stated goal will require that we investigate both student and faculty perceptions of intersecting social identities and their confluence with engineering culture. A mixed methods approach will be used, combining both qualitative and quantitative techniques in order to provide a more holistic understanding. By the end of the grant, the following objectives will be met: (i) ascertain themes of identity severance among engineering and computer science students from marginalized communities that have the potential to affect the path towards becoming situated within the engineering profession; and, (ii) identify the role faculty's understanding of relational and structural power across difference plays in helping or hindering students from marginalized groups successfully navigate the path towards becoming situated within the engineering profession. This project will be implemented collaboratively across three very distinct institutions -- Kapiolani Community College (a two-year tribal college), Oregon State University (a Research I institution), and The University of Texas-Pan American (a Hispanic Serving Institution).  The three serve significantly different student populations and regions, but most likely share manifestations of identity severance that influence the success and persistence of engineering and computer science students."

Throughout education, images are used to clearly convey complex ideas and to stimulate curiosity and interest.  Likewise, investigations in the biological sciences and in medicine invariably require clear pictures of cells, tissues, and organs to discover mechanisms of life and to detect and understand the complex pathological processes of disease. Therefore, imaging is the centerpiece for this REU Site, serving as a bridge between education, engineering, the biological sciences, and medicine. Students gain an advanced skillset in state-of-the-art imaging technologies and interdisciplinary research that they can carry with them to graduate school. They are exposed to the breadth of imaging techniques and medical applications while simultaneously focusing on a specific project at the forefront of biology and medical science. This program applies literature-supported mentorship and training strategies to directly address pipeline leaks for the transition of under-represented groups to graduate degree programs in engineering or related programs. The program also provides enrichment of technical skills, professionalism, and career-readiness. The program is assessed and refined in real-time to continually improve the student experience and value. <br/><br/>This REU Site is dedicated to inspiring and training undergraduates in STEM fields through a summer experience in biomedical imaging research. The goal is to create a coherent interdisciplinary program centered on the visualization of biology and human tissues at all scales, and for students to develop a network of role models, mentors, and peers to support and encourage their transition to graduate school.

Students begin this 10-week summer program with a 3-day ""Bioimaging Bootcamp"" to provide foundational knowledge in biology, imaging, and microscopy through lectures, demonstrations, lab activities, and tours, together with social introductions. Students then engage in intensive research projects in imaging and biological visualization, closely mentored by a faculty member and graduate student. All research projects, ranging from imaging single molecules using fluorescence microscopy to MRI-based imaging of the brain in living mammals, have three essential elements: (1) imaging and/or microscopy, (2) a hypothesis-driven analysis of biological samples, and (3) an analytical or computational component. Students also have unique clinical medical imaging immersion experiences, share experiences with their cohort through biweekly social activities, attend research seminars and professional development sessions, and interact with participants in other REUs on campus to expand their network. Summer achievements culminate in poster and oral presentations at a campus undergraduate research symposium that draws undergraduate researchers from throughout the Midwest, as well as the submission of an abstract to the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) Annual Meeting, where they reconvene in the Fall for continued education, networking, and career-enriching opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a crucial need to help Alaska Native pre-college students become better prepared for engineering degree programs. Previous research indicates that a feeling like they belong in engineering is important for Alaska Native engineering students to succeed in high school preparatory engineering courses and engineering degree programs. This CAREER project aims to investigate belonging among Alaska Native high school students in engineering preparatory classrooms. The project will lead to new teaching approaches that support Alaska Native students prepare for engineering, and increase the diversity of the engineering profession.<br/><br/>This study seeks to 1) determine community characteristics that Alaska Native students and Alaskan teachers describe as important or necessary for developing a sense of belonging among Alaska Native students in high school engineering preparatory classrooms; and 2) determine how a sense of belonging influences Alaska Native high school students to make decisions to take advanced engineering preparatory courses in high school. Through theoretical frameworks of sense of community and belonging, this study will use a narrative approach to construct a model for design of educational innovations for Alaska Native students. This model will contribute to engineering education researchers' understanding of Alaska Native underrepresentation and under-preparation in pre-college and college engineering degree programs. The research team will interview current or recently graduated Alaska Native high school students and Alaskan teachers from diverse Alaska Native communities. Based on the research findings, the team will design and implement a professional development course for Alaskan K-12 teachers. The intent is to offer the course in multiple years following the end of the grant to extend its impact. This work will be used to augment the existing pre-college and college components of the Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program (ANSEP) by being directly implemented into engineering classrooms, engineering preparatory classrooms, and hands-on engineering recruiting activities. The results of this research will also be disseminated through engineering education and Native education research journals and conferences."

These biological machines have the potential to enhance or even transform our ability to accomplish certain tasks, e.g., detecting and removing unwanted chemical or toxin from a food or drug, monitoring the environment, or mimicking certain aspects of organ function. In addition to the scientific foundational needs addressed by this project, there are U.S. workforce development considerations being addressed, training next generation of U.S. researchers how to communicate and perform multi-disciplinary work, multi-institutional research, and to productively working in collaborative, multi-ethnic, virtual teams, as these formats are progressively being used across all enterprises. To do so, EBICS: VITA REU will immerse scholars into virtual research teams at one of three institutions (Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, or MIT) with an independent project and mentor that contributes to a larger research goal aligned with EBICS grand challenge. Targeted approaches for recruiting cohorts of students traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines (women, underrepresented minority (URM) students, students with disabilities, and students from schools with limited STEM research opportunities) will occur with a set plan in place having already being initiated.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>This project acknowledges the support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers to train the next generation U.S. workforce to function successfully in virtual teams that are multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary, and multi-ethnic. EBICS is an NSF Science and Technology Center addressing the grand challenge of engineering clusters of living cells or biological machines that have desired functionalities and perform prescribed tasks. EBICS is also defining quantitative design principles for creating such machines, and for understanding and controlling the flow of information (genetic, biochemical, mechanical, electrical) within and between cells, in a dynamic, multi-scale fashion. This involves integration of concepts from tissue engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology, as well as established disciplines such as electrical engineering and computer science; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; biomedical engineering; biology; chemistry. Research and educational activities will incorporate REU scholars into virtual, multi-institutional research Working Groups, with independent projects contributing to a larger research thrust. Video- and tele-conferencing during the research experience will provide committed professional development on presenting in virtual formats.  All virtual teams and REU scholars will travel and meet face-to-face at the annual EBICS retreat to interact with their Working Group, as well as other EBICS faculty from Georgia Tech, Univ. of Illinois, and MIT, EBICS graduate and postdoctoral trainees, providing a broader network far beyond that of just being at one institution. This EBICS:VITA REU will also employ a robust evaluation to validate and document the effectiveness of this new multi-site, virtual team REU model using a value-engaged, educative approach that defines high quality STEM educational programming as that which effectively incorporates cutting edge scientific content, strong instructional pedagogy and sensitivity to diversity and equity issues."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Vehicles consume approximately 19% of the world's energy and produce approximately 23% of total greenhouse gas emissions each year. Over 30% of this energy consumption originates from simply overcoming losses due to friction and wear. Further, many new energy-efficient technologies are obstructed by issues related to friction and wear. For example, low viscosity lubricants can greatly reduce energy losses in engines and drivetrains, but there is still no solution to prevent the harsher wear that results when lower viscosity lubricants are used. Such new technologies are impeded by the lack of fundamental knowledge in tribology - the study of friction, lubrication, and wear. Related to this, there is a lack of advanced materials, components, and design approaches in industry that are aimed at reducing friction and wear. Moreover, the tribology workforce in the U.S. is ageing and dwindling due to a lack of education and training efforts. This planning grant will bring together a diverse set of innovators to identify the most promising technologies, the best-equipped team, and the most receptive industry and institute partners to form Tribo-CREST: the ERC for Tribology to Create Reliable, Efficient, Sustainable Transportation. Tribo-CREST will aim to transform the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of vehicle technologies with a primary focus on engines and drivetrains. The ERC this planning grant will be working towards will aim to produce new knowledge, methods, and facilities; transformative commercial impact; and a reinvigorated, diverse, tribology workforce.<br/><br/>Tribology is a highly convergent research domain. Phenomena related to physics, chemistry, solid mechanics, surface science, fluid mechanics, thermal science, and materials science all exist and interact at the contact between two sliding surfaces. Tribologists must understand and predict these complex phenomena, which occur at a dynamic interface hidden from view. Thus, tribology solutions require the deep integration of knowledge at the intersections of multiple domains, new and innovative experimental and simulation tools, and diverse teams who can assemble the multi-faceted perspectives needed. While this poses tremendous challenges, it also illustrates the scale of the opportunity for a tribology-focused ERC. To accomplish this, the proposing team will identify methods, facilities, people, and industries whose partnership will result in an ERC proposal for cutting-edge research and education on vehicle engine and drivetrain technology. This involves studying advanced materials with engineered surfaces where performance hinges not only on strength, but on weakness: recent work has shown that the best engineered tribological systems achieve easy sliding while maintaining low wear through dynamic formation and regeneration of soft interfacial films. The planning grant team will integrate the input of 30-40 experts from academia, industry, research institutes, national laboratories, industry consortia, and professional societies, who will help formulate the basis for a visionary ERC. The team will assess how the ERC can exceed national averages for participation of women, minorities, Veterans, and first-generation low income students (FGLIs) by leveraging the diverse populations and successful diversity programs of the lead institutions: U.C.-Merced (53% Hispanic students); Texas A&M U. (10th nationwide in Hispanic PhDs and a top-ranked school for Veterans); U. Florida (in the top 10 for Hispanic and African American bachelor's and doctoral degrees); and U. Pennsylvania (a private university with need-blind admission whose engineering school has increased its FGLI population substantially in recent years).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>With an expected global population nearing 10 billion by 2050, meeting food, energy, and water needs has surfaced as one of the most profound challenges of the new millennium.  With new technological advances, these significant global problems that threaten the health, wealth and security of the US can be alleviated by fusing biology and polymers in a paradigm shifting approaches where polymers are part of the solution instead of part of the problem.  For example, polymer-enhanced cells hold the promise to eliminate the scourge of salmonella (causing 1.2 million illnesses per year in the US alone) contamination in poultry by increasing the stability of probiotics in animal feeds.  Polymer-enhanced proteins may eliminate phosphate waste products in intensive animal farming (if unresolved the phosphate waste will render land non-arable by 2050) and combat pathogens that can rapidly decimate agriculture farms.  Polymer-enhanced enzymes can decontaminate pesticides at the point of use before they contaminate ground water (pesticides are now detected in over 95% of ground water).  Polymer-enhanced biocatalysts may be able to finally degrade and resolve microplastic pollution of our oceans (well in excess of 10 trillion particles contaminate water sources and only 1 percent of plastics contaminating our oceans are at the surface).  This planning grant will be used to assemble a large team to develop and deploy biohybrid molecules and cells as key components in transforming problems of global significance. This planning grant will be used to formulate the strategy for the team, ensuring that the work generates pioneering science that impacts society.<br/><br/>This planning grant will be used to assemble domain experts and use their knowledge to plan a complex team-based transformational program.  They plan to build an extraordinary interdisciplinary team that tackles the major barriers that prevent fusion of biotic and abiotic systems.  This grant will support the team building necessary to transform the focus areas of prediction, synthesis, characterization and utilization of biohybrids.  The Strategic Planning Initiative will begin with four mini-retreats in designated Focus Areas. In each mini-retreat, a small group of specialists will meet to identify the barriers, solutions and people that will form the team.  Next, two Global Impact mini-retreats will bring together leaders in polymer-enhanced biology with those in food, water and pollution threats to sustainability.  The mini-retreats will serve as the starting point for the deliberations during the final planning session that will be used to develop the research, education, outreach and partnership consensus for an eventual ERC in Polymer-Enhanced Biology.  Throughout the retreat and planning process, the plan is to focus on developing a comprehensive strategy in the four interconnected ERC foundational components: research, engineering workforce development, diversity/culture of inclusion, and the innovation ecosystem. The plan is to use new science and engineering to impact society through education, infrastructure, and innovation.  Team-based science at the interface of chemistry and biology will deliver solutions to high priority problems of global significance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the recent activities to rectify the deficiency of underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines have focused on initiatives from grade school to undergraduate college degrees (K-16).  These initiatives have made significant advances to enhancing the diversity of the US work force, however they have had minimal effect on the number of graduating PhD students entering professional positions as faculty in academic fields.  The lack of faculty diversification is alarming, considering that the primary sustainable method for developing future college-educated generations is a diverse STEM faculty. The goal of this collaborative project led by the University of Akron, in partnership with Mississippi State University and the University of Houston, is to increase the participation of underrepresented populations in engineering that pursue academic careers.  Providing participants with additional training in STEM education will yield more prepared engineering educators, which will lead to better-equipped engineers entering the workforce.  Similarly, affording additional skills to obtain research funding will assist with participants' ability to succeed at all stages of their careers.  An increase in underrepresented faculty could have a long-term sustainable impact on increasing the number of underrepresented populations that enter and are retained in engineering disciplines by providing academic role models/mentors.  The research component of this study will add to the national knowledge based on issues of career progression and inform practices on training doctoral students and postdoctoral associates. <br/><br/>The proposed project builds upon the findings of the investigators 1.5 day workshops that focused on preparing PhD and postdoctoral trainees for academia.  Our findings, which supported previous outcomes, determined that most new faculty members, whether they had postdoctoral training or not, were not adequately prepared for academia.  The proposed project will provide expanded, intensive professional preparation for PhD and postdoctoral students through a series of two-week intensive summer professional preparation courses in conjunction with year-long activities to offer practical hands-one training in the areas of teaching and research.  Participants will be provided an opportunity to write a travel proposal to receive funds to meet with a federal grant coordinator or attend an educational/technical conference.  Each year the approach will be implemented and hosted at one of the collaborating institutions with participants recruited from the host university, institutions within a 200 mile radius, as well as a two from each of the collaborating institutions.  This effort has potential to significantly increase the numbers of underrepresented populations in engineering fields that pursue academic careers."

This research experience offers two emphasis areas - devices for diagnostics and sensing and devices for therapeutics and intervention. Targeted student participants include science/engineering majors, especially underrepresented students, from institutions across the nation that lack strong research opportunities. Biomedical engineering research is seen as a growth area for scientific and technological discovery nationally. To attract and retain the next generation of diverse, talented engineers, it is critical to provide undergraduates with research experiences that tie together the elements of STEM - fundamentally based in science and math, using technology tools to achieve engineering solutions - in a context demonstrating societal impact. This is particularly important in the engineering field, where a complementary balance exists between traditional undergraduate training, which focuses on producing applied results, and the academic rigor of hypothesis-driven or needs-based research required to generate breakthroughs. The growing field of biomedical engineering (BME) provides an appropriate and effective framework in which to implement a high-impact undergraduate research program addressing this need. <br/><br/>UNL will host nine REU students over a 10-week summer program. The objectives of the proposed project are to: 1) provide interdisciplinary research experiences to undergraduates in the area of biomedical devices; 2) give participants confidence to become independent researchers by providing systematic instruction in research methodology; 3) provide participants with a broader view of research and development activities in academia and industry; and 4) expand participants' skills and knowledge regarding academic-industry partnerships, such as technology transfer and entrepreneurship. Structured research activities will be complemented by professional development activities including undergraduate research symposia, designed to prepare participants for STEM careers.

QoLT is a natural fit for this site because the Pittsburgh region is presently a world leader in research and development related to the aging and disability communities; therefore a high density of rewarding research opportunities are available for RET participants.  All of these opportunities are grounded within a common QoLT research focus, through collaborations between University of Pittsburgh's Department of Rehabilitation Science and Technology (RST) Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Human Computer Interaction (HCII) and Robotics Institutes (RI). The research and development projects will build upon recent advances in QoLT that enable people with disabilities to live more independently in their homes and maximize their community participation.  This site builds on previously successful RET programs at the University of Pittsburgh with the core objective of improving the STEM capacity of the nation's students by using product innovation techniques to provide applied outlets for teachers and their students.  The RET research focus is of social significance and will contribute towards the development of technologies that will increase persons with disabilities' independence. <br/><br/>Over three years, 30 STEM high school teachers, from high need urban high schools in Pittsburgh comprised of minority and low socio-economic status students, will take part in a 14-week research experience, including a product innovation course in the fall and a 4-week curriculum development experience over the summer.  This RET Site retains a QoLT engineering research theme and a focus on math through product development economics, while adding a focus on design and peer assessment pedagogy. The site will continue to integrate military veterans with disabilities transitioning to college into project teams, allowing for cross-mentorship and a personal connection to the research.  The site's approach involves a seamless transition between the research experience and teaching via a common product innovation focus, drawing upon institutional strengths in the research and innovation of HERL and curriculum reform expertise from the Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC). This RET will become a vehicle to develop and strengthen teachers' skills in design based learning (DBL) through unique peer assessment approaches that can reduce burden and increase students' learning outcomes.  The unique approach of incorporating flipped classroom modules for the innovation course and an online high school student design competition promotes scalability through potential adoption of the program's methods throughout the full RET network and other interested teachers throughout Pittsburgh and the nation."

This project will create a mobile makerspace that weaves together conventional and cultural making, rich with American Indian STEM role models and traditional tools and practices of the Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Oreille tribes. The project pursues the research question: does pairing cultural and conventional makerspace activities advance design thinking and community capacity in making? The project is designed to develop a national model for community-driven making in rural, tribal communities.<br/><br/>By creating a mobile, cultural makerspace and a cultural making curriculum and engagement model to share with the informal science education and maker fields, this project seeks to enable cultural tools and knowledge to increase making capabilities in rural, tribal communities. Through visits to each of the communities on Montana's Flathead Indian Reservation, the project aims to increase K-12 students' interest in and awareness of cultural making and design thinking; their access to cultural role models engaged in design thinking; and their creative confidence, experimental mindset/mindshift, and design thinking skills. Designed in partnership with cultural heritage experts, craftspeople, and tribal elders, the project's mobile makerspace will engage an estimated 5,000 K-12 youth in an array of school and community settings. All of these efforts pursue the end goals of instilling a sense of belonging in STEM, design thinking, and making, as well as empowering a homegrown, American Indian STEM workforce on the Flathead Reservation.<br/><br/>This project has the potential to introduce and engage a wide range of learners, including meritorious students, from a rural American Indian community to making specifically, and to STEM more broadly, in a culturally aware way.

The Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST) ERC will transform the existing electricity generation system towards a sustainable and ubiquitous one by developing photovoltaic (PV) technologies with higher efficiency and novel functionality. QESST will meet the TW challenge by enabling a large, sustained growth rate of photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation by circumventing the trade-off between efficiency increases and cost decreases, allowing PV devices that are scalable to commercial production and which provide a route for continuous improvements in performance and affordability. The first thrust supporting this goal directly addresses the energy generation system itself through development of technologies and policies which will allow the scale-up of novel PV devices into large-scale manufacturing, enabling the PV industry to rapidly reach TW levels of energy production. QESST's second thrust seeks to charter a  ""Moore's Law"" for photovoltaics via breakthrough improvements in solar cell efficiencies to ultimately realize structures with dramatically higher energy generation per unit volume of material, a primary parameter driving cost reduction. Finally,the third thrust augments the other two by means of fundamental research directed towards realizing the theoretical thermodynamic limit of solar-to-electric conversion (~85%) through a variety of state-of-the-art approaches which overcome the limitations of single bandgap solar cells (~32%).

There is a disproportionately small number of faculty members from underrepresented groups who hold positions in US colleges and universities, particularly in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and math. To meet this challenge, the project develops strategies, training materials, and a structured mentoring program to increase the capability of graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows who intend to become tenure track faculty members in engineering, engineering technology, and the sciences. Participation in the project will enable graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows to become more effective faculty members. An emphasis is placed on the development of participant's portfolio in the areas of teaching, research, and service well in advance of beginning their career.  <br/><br/>The network improvement community brings together an alliance of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions, researchers, practitioners, industry partners, community stakeholders, school districts, and mentoring organizations. Working together the community will develop a model to comprehensively support the mentoring and training of underrepresented minorities to become effective faculty. The goals of the project are to: 1) implement an evidence-based comprehensive professional development model; 2) train graduate students in the core competency skills needed to effectively navigate the graduate and postdoctoral training process and to successfully achieve careers in the engineering professoriate; and 3) collaborate, promote, and plan activities to enhance and complement existing efforts of an alliance of HBCUs and MSIs to achieve the common goal of increasing the representation and preparation of underrepresented minorities in the professoriate. A quasi-experimental research design with matched groups will be used to the effectiveness of the project."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>This Planning Grant project is focused on activities that will identify and bring together the technical and practical expertise necessary to address the major societal challenges of biodefense. Biodefense challenges, like infectious diseases and bioterrorist attacks, can have a direct impact on individuals, as well as serious consequences for agriculture. This has a direct impact on the food supply and food security.  A national priority to address these growing public health, economic, and societal threats is research and development that enable the 1) rapid detection of infectious agents/toxins, 2) rapid diagnosis, 3) rapid production of medical countermeasures, and 4) rapid and efficient deployment of these medical countermeasures.  In addition to being rapid, these technologies must also be cost-effective and deployable under a variety of resource-limited situations. The planning grant will advance the field of biodefense by bringing together faculty, students and stakeholders from different disciplines to address technical needs.  It will also support education through the involvement of undergraduates and graduate students in the planning grant activities. The planning grant activities will help identify research directions needed to protect lives and preserve animal and plant health in the face of natural and intentional biological threats.<br/><br/>The goals of the planning grant activities include (1) a detailed understanding of the basic science, engineering, computational, social science, workforce development, innovation ecosystem, and diversity and inclusion components needed to address this societal problem; (2) identification of strategic academic, industry, and governmental partners, as well as specific areas of expertise needed, unique existing facilities and testbeds required for success; (3) identification of the stakeholder community, establishing relationships with them, and using their knowledge base to inform (1) and (2) above; (4) independent evaluation and refinement of the concept of the proposed NSF ERC; (5) development of a center identity (i.e. name, vision statement, goals, strategic model), and (6) creation of an effective leadership/management structure.  These benefits are not possible without bringing faculty and stakeholders together in person. These interactions will establish areas of partnerships in convergent research, identify gaps and prioritize activities and strategies for an ERC.  The planning grant activities will culminate in a 2-day workshop, bringing together faculty from the partner universities, stakeholders from industry, governmental agencies, funding agencies, non-profits, community and workforce development organizations along with students. In the end, planning grant activities will establish a stronger, crystallized vision for the scope, leadership structure, team, partner network, and activities of an Engineering Research Center in Global Biodefense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last two decades have focused on the U.S. lag in terms of the per capita graduates in STEM-related disciplines compared to an increasing number of European and Asian countries. A more pressing need and new for the first time in U.S. history is that the emerging majority of K-12 U.S. students are first-generation and from minority groups, who are significantly under-represented in engineering and other STEM -elated fields. The participation of underrepresented groups of women and minorities in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) is far below their percentage representation of the population as a whole. This reality points to both systemic problems within the discipline in terms of attracting students to the field and suffers from the on-going discussions about achievement gaps in the K-12 education. The identification of appropriate role models and mentors within ECE in particular is deemed necessary to increase the efficiency of participants staying with the profession. The objectives of Project Connect are to directly address the aforementioned problems by exposing underrepresented students to exciting opportunities and potential mentors within the IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS) community related to broad technology areas such as electronics and communications.  These objectives will be met through the IMS 2018 and 2019 programming effort of Project Connect, which brings underrepresented university students to the symposium to engage with the university and industry professionals for exposure, guidance, and development in technical areas ranging from research and development, to applications and near-term industrial initiatives. The three primary objectives for the IMS Connect Program are to provide the following:(1)education about the rf/microwave industry,(2)awareness on career opportunities and expectations, and (3)access to and guidance from role models and potential mentors who are active in the field as educators, practitioners, researchers, and industry leaders. <br/><br/>The support being requested from the National Science Foundation is for travel stipends for the student participants in IMS Connect for 2018 (Philadelphia, PA) and 2019 (Boston, MA). IMS is the largest conference in the world for RF/microwave engineers. Students who are selected to participate in IMS Connect will attend the conference for four days, in which they will participate in several professional development activities, learn about student activities for aspiring microwave engineers, and meet and network with  other engineering students, professionals, and leaders in the field. Selected student participants will also learn about microwave industries and local cultures in the conference location region."

The rising cost of healthcare, the increased role of technology in medicine, and emerging ethical dilemmas created by an increasing and aging population require that all bioengineers and healthcare providers understand the social and ethical context of their work to derive solutions that can meet these complex needs. However, students are typically isolated from these social contexts during their technical training, limiting their ability to identify and understand the needs of society and healthcare providers. Consequently, these students are limited in their ability to derive optimal engineering or technological solutions. The Bioengineering curriculum is being changed to achieve four objectives: 1) redesign the curriculum so that societal needs for healthcare and medicine drive the technical content, 2) integrate out-of-class experiences so that students receive hands-on practice with identifying and understanding societal and healthcare provider needs, 3) translate medical assessment practices to align clinical experiences with the curriculum, and 4) develop faculty teaching skills to meet these new challenges by engaging their intrinsic motivations to revolutionize the department. This revolution is driven locally by the creation and launch of the first Engineering-Based College of Medicine in the nation in fall 2018 that will integrate instruction in engineering with clinical and biological sciences.<br/><br/>Catalyzed by the Grinter Report, engineering education was previously revolutionized by aligning its practice and education with science. This alignment created a social-technical duality in engineering where the technical skills were elevated and social skills were relegated. In response, calls have risen for holistic training of engineering students who understand the societal needs and the societal implications of their practice. This change can be accomplished by aligning sub-disciplines of engineering with other holistic disciplines. The next revolution in bioengineering education can be brokered by realigning with healthcare and medicine - areas of impact and practice that holistically integrate social and technical aspects. This revised curriculum integrates clinical experiences that provide a context for students to learn ethnographic methods for user-oriented needs identification and problem scoping. While traditional curricula organize courses by their technical content, the new curriculum organizes courses by the needs that the curriculum will empower students to solve. Needs such as age-related disease, global health, and cancer provide the starting point for students who are navigating their curriculum. The use of new assessment tools such as competency-based models and e-portfolios integrate these new curricular tracks with the clinical experiences. Finally, to help faculty learn how to execute this new curriculum, the Bioengineering faculty are organized into Communities of Practice to execute course and assessment revisions. This process is driven by departmental administration who are guided and supported by organizational change researchers. This revolution is being spread beyond the Illinois campus through accreditation agencies and technical societies."

Bioanalytical engineering encompasses the design and manipulation of biomolecules, viruses, bacteria and cells, as well as the fabrication of innovative analytical devices for the detection and monitoring of these biomaterials.  These efforts directly address pertinent problems related to medicine, public health, petroleum and biofuel production, bioremediation of groundwater, and designing target-specific pharmaceuticals. Because these are important and relevant topics for Oklahoma rural communities, integrating these topics into STEM education will: strengthen rural education, build a network of educators (ranging from rural high school teachers and regional community college instructors to university research faculty), and promote a career-preparation pathway for rural youth in Oklahoma.  This effort will increase the Oklahoma workforce, which needs highly trained professionals in these areas. In the long-term, the knowledge and results gained from this RET program will help build sustainable education initiatives to reach rural students and teachers, and as a result, will support sustainable rural communities.  <br/><br/>Over three years, 48 rural Oklahoma educators (high school teachers and regional community college instructors) will conduct bioanalytical engineering research (for seven weeks each summer) at the University of Oklahoma (OU) in collaboration with eight faculty associated with the OU Center for Bioanalysis (CBA). The summer research experience will be designed according to the SUCCESS Framework to maximize RET educators' sense of efficacy for conducting research and to increase their motivation to transfer these experiences into their classrooms. The SUCCESS Framework guides teachers, designers and instructors at all levels and in all contexts, providing a structure for integrating theory-based motivational features into any type of instruction. Educators will be recruited from three regions of rural Oklahoma that are typically overlooked because of their distance from urban centers and major universities. Educators from the same or adjacent rural districts will be paired to facilitate collaboration in the development and implementation of authentic, guided-inquiry curricula that utilize fundamental STEM concepts, apply bioanalytical engineering, and address issues of rural interest and relevance. The SUCCESS Framework will be integrated into the curricular design to improve the students' motivation in learning and the educators' teaching efficacy. This collaboration will establish a professional rural educator network that includes interactions with faculty research mentors and graduate students through classroom visits, field trips, sampling trips, virtual presentations and interactions. The professional rural educator network will be further strengthened and expanded upon by dissemination of curricular materials and motivational design methods through workshops for rural STEM educators at the annual OU K20 Center's Innovative Learning Institute, annual sessions on rural STEM education at the National Rural Education Association, and educator-student poster sessions and presentations at the annual CBA symposium."

The project involves the development of a combined Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers (REU-RET) Mega-Site that is centered on the following research topics that are related to Smart and Connected Cities: IoT Security, Renewable Energy, Energy Storage, Smart Grid, Human Computer Interaction, and Advanced Materials. The consortium of institutions involved in this effort are 14 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and 1 Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The project targets lower division students who are less likely to have the opportunity to participate in research as undergraduates. Participation in this type of experience has been demonstrated to be transformative and to have the potential to increase retention and graduation rates at these institutions. RET participants will be recruited from local community colleges and high schools that serve as feeder schools to the consortium institutions.<br/><br/>Providing quality research experiences to an underserved group of undergraduate students and teachers will lay the foundation for positively impacting the retention and graduation of engineering students for years to come, while also increasing the number of minority students who will eventually pursue graduate degrees. In addition, the program will improve the quality of science and engineering education at local high schools and community colleges, further stimulating the interest and imagination of underrepresented minority students who might not otherwise be inclined to pursue higher education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

Throughout their graduate studies, biomedical students immerse themselves in research, with little or no training in best teaching practices or knowledge of alternative, non-academic career opportunities, such as industry or government agencies. As a result, graduates who do not continue with traditional academic careers struggle with the transition to non-academic careers because they know very little about alternatives; also, those who remain in academics and research struggle with the increasing teaching demands they face as faculty. While graduate school used to be considered a rite of passage to a career in academic research, a job in academics is no longer a guarantee. Thus, biomedical graduate programs have a responsibility to reconsider how they are training their students for their careers after graduation.  The goal of this project is to develop a course sequence for graduate students to learn more about alternative careers and best teaching practices.  The graduate students will not only learn about careers and teaching practices, but they also will work with postdoctoral fellows and faculty to translate what they learn into an undergraduate classroom.  This will give them a chance to have a first-hand teaching experience and consider how to develop the critical skills needed by today's biomedical workforce.  <br/><br/>The purpose of this Design and Development project is to develop a transferrable model for graduate student professional development as both educators and non-academics. Graduate education is faced with two fundamental problems: 1) students who choose to pursue academics are not trained how to teach; and, 2) graduates who choose to leave academics have little exposure to alternative postgraduate opportunities. This project focuses on developing an Incubator/Apprenticeship Model that exposes graduate students to the rapidly changing world of science and technology innovations and workforce trends, while being immersed in the exploration of learning theories and research-based teaching approaches for curriculum design (e.g. problem-based learning, active learning). As a result, graduate students will participate in an immersive curriculum development experience informed by evidence-based practices and be exposed to non-academic postgraduate opportunities commonly not addressed directly in higher education. The development of this innovation leverages the instructional design process, social constructivist theory, situated learning theory, and instructor beliefs. While this proof of concept is grounded in the context of biomedical engineering, the proposed theory of action is broadly applicable.  The impact of the proposed sequence will be studied qualitatively and quantitatively.  Students will be surveyed pre- and post-instruction.  A subset of students will also be interviewed.  This proposed instructional design sequence is a proof of concept for a novel, transferrable model for programs to foster graduate student professional development that is responsive to the rapidly changing world of science and technology innovations and workforce trends.  Results will be disseminated on the University of Michigan Biomedical Enginering Transforming Engineering Education website and through educational conferences and journal articles.  Other institutions interested in implementing this sequence are invited to attend any of the classes and reach out for consultation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DER such as rooftop solar, electric vehicles, controllable air conditioners and water heaters are connecting in increasing numbers.  However, DER requires massive amounts of coordination supported by real-time information flows. There are well-known technical integration challenges with this transition, but just as importantly, there are non-technical challenges that are often overlooked. Specifically, consumers and local communities may not accept DER due to privacy issues, risk perceptions, distributional and procedural fairness. Such concerns can derail the transition to a smart and sustainable energy future. To grow to the requisite scale for real-world impact, renewables and DER require an interdisciplinary approach that integrates technical and socio-behavioral considerations. It is clear that such an effort will require a collaborative, transdisciplinary approach, which is exemplar of convergent research; the merging of approaches and insights from historically distinct disciplines to address problems that exist at the interface of multiple fields. This project supports an interdisciplinary planning process, with engineers and social scientists, industry, and policy makers, led by Cornell and engaging current and new partners to provide national leadership to address this challenge.<br/><br/>The grant will plan a Center with the capacity to address the interdisciplinary technical and socio-behavioral challenges to DER integration into smart grids. The PIs will apply innovative research in the science of team science (SciTS), and the design and development of the transdisciplinary research vision toward a shared, crucial, societal objective, which has not been widely applied in engineering research. Solutions at scale will not be adopted without involving social scientists in the engineering design processes up front, and therein lies a core component of the intellectual merit of the proposed planning process. The planning process for a potential Engineering Research Center (ERC) is distinctive in its deep, effective collaboration across a disciplinary chasm that is rarely bridged effectively.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. <br/><br/>This award serves as a planning grant for a proposed Engineering Research Center (ERC) that will address the challenge of chemical and biological hazards of hurricanes and severe storms from coast to inland. This is a challenge that has significant societal impact affecting human health and loss of life especially for disadvantaged communities that lack the human, financial and technical resources to identify, plan for and respond to the potential risks. Chemical and biological hazards can stem from failures in chemical processing, storage and disposal facilities, water or wastewater infrastructure, and hospitals and human health care delivery systems. In most cases, the exposures and potential exposures are novel, only occurring when the chemical and biological safety net has been pulled back temporarily by the wind, storm surge and flooding from the storm. The efforts will identify and understand the challenges to communities and community health and the connection between communities stressed by severe events and disease vectors that might lead to outbreaks. Particular needs include better predictive tools for identifying potential hazards and the risks they may pose in extreme events and real time understanding of the realized risks. The convergence of the physical, chemical and biological sciences and engineering with the medical and public health communities is critical to successfully coupling the hazards with realized risks. <br/><br/>The planning approach includes high performance charrettes with stakeholders to develop an in-depth understanding of the challenges to be addressed in the ERC. A knowledge-workshop will be used to develop the ERC components, and integration efforts will enable positioning the ERC within the current research landscape. Web-enabled video conferencing with science and engineering experts is planned for the purpose of knowledge sharing and team formation for the ERC in advance of a culmination workshop focused on team building and leadership. The planning grant will bring together the diverse groups involved in the challenge of biological and chemicals hazards during hurricanes and severe storms that normally do not interact and collaborate, leading to a truly convergent evidence-based and diverse research collaboration. Most importantly, vulnerable communities will be engaged, particularly disadvantaged populations into the ERC. The goal is to gain informed insight into stakeholder expectations and needs and clarifying diverse community understanding and perceptions of their environment, and health and safety.

Research has yet to explore whether a heightened emphasis on social control in these environments provides a climate antithetical to the cultivation of adolescents' innovative thinking and creativity, attributes that are considered essential to their success in the engineering sciences. Research of this kind will be useful in identifying: 1) the school and neighborhood dimensions most strongly related to the dispositions and trajectories of underrepresented populations at key junctures of engineering pathways, and 2) the kind of educational reforms and neighborhood programs that will aid students' secondary school preparation, post-secondary persistence in the fields, and eventual entry into the engineering professions. In support of these important aims, this research applies advanced statistical methods to the ELS dataset to answer the following questions:   <br/><br/>1. What contextual structures, processes and effects in existing research are most related to race-gender groups' occupational attainment in engineering?<br/><br/>2. Are school and neighborhood social control strategies related to race-gender trajectories in secondary school preparation, post-secondary persistence, and entry into the engineering workforce? <br/><br/>3. Is more variation in race-gender groups' engineering career trajectories accounted for by their neighborhood or school context? <br/><br/>4. What causal inferences can be made about the engineering career trajectories of nearly identical race-gender groups that differ in their exposure to more or less restrictive methods of social control within neighborhoods and schools?<br/><br/>The transformative potential of this study extends from its capacity to fill multiple voids in our engineering workforce development and broadening participation knowledge base. Identifying neighborhood and school qualities associated with race-gender groups' likelihood of entering engineering science professions contributes specific knowledge about school and non-school contexts as sites of engineering career development. This project considers whether society's pursuit of social control and order establishes a climate within both contexts that is antithetical to the cultivation of adolescents' interest in engineering. Youth of color, African American and Latino males in particular, are most likely to be exposed to punitive social control strategies, and may become less likely to enter the engineering field as a consequence. To explore these possibilities, this project uses systematic literature review procedures and innovative quantitative methods to investigate the longitudinal career trajectories of participants in the Educational Longitudinal Study (ELS) of 2002. The research uses social control, intersectionality, and status attainment theories to frame the estimation of race-gender trajectories at critical stages of career development. This study aligns with NSF priorities and national calls to broaden the participation of historically underrepresented groups at all stages of their career development. Study results about the engineering experiences of race-gender groups within neighborhood and school contexts will reveal areas where investment and reforms can expand access and interest in engineering careers. The policy relevance of this research is significant and will inform decision-makers and practitioners about the human capital cost to engineering fields previously hidden in the uninvestigated effects of social control strategies.

The diverse ideas and skills required from combining engineering and art encourages creative student thinking and opens new, non-traditional pathways into engineering. New domains of engineering such as computer graphics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction require engineers to work with designers, visual artists, and humanities scholars for their science and technologies to have societal impact. Engineers need not just technical skills, but social awareness and communication skills to effectively work across these domain boundaries of art and engineering. Through combining engineering and art curriculum, these needs are addressed in a meaningful way. These programs typically feature an extensive collaboration or design project for students in engineering and the arts to interact and work with one another. However, much research has pointed out the difficulty of these interactions between participants due to the diversity of viewpoint, background, and skills. This project aims to understand theories of knowledge that students utilize in a collaborative engineering and arts environment. This will help develop a better understanding of the nature of interactions at the boundary of art and engineering. Insights that emerge from this work promise to improve the educational experiences of engineers interacting in these programs and foster new, diverse and inclusive ways of working for the engineering workforce. <br/><br/>This project is a comparative study of two subsets of students at Arizona State University: (i) a group of engineering and arts students pursuing a year-long design/capstone project from the transdisciplinary School of Arts, Media and Engineering; and (ii) a contrasting group of engineering students pursuing a year-long senior design project in a traditional Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering School. Through analysis of these student's experiences, researchers answer a series of research questions on the range and depth of epistemological beliefs held by participants in both populations, and any similarities and differences among the participants. In addition, through discourse analysis of language and terms used by participants and of observation notes of working groups, researchers reveal philosophical viewpoints and how these viewpoints affect communication, offering insight into effective collaboration between engineering and the arts.  The intellectual merits of this proposal include generation of fundamental knowledge into the epistemological viewpoints and interactions in art and engineering learning environments and conceptual frameworks of personal epistemology in education. The broader impacts of this project include pedagogical material for transdisciplinary engineering and media arts courses, public outreach and participation through the Center for Science and the Imagination, and participation in the Digital Culture Summer Institute to introduce a diverse set of middle and high school students to engineering and the arts projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By doing so this project will increase the impact of NSF's prior and future investments in engineering education research. Researchers and educators will work together to develop a shared understanding and language around how engineering education research can influence educational practice. This will enable them to effectively articulate the impact of their work to diverse audiences and more carefully plan broad impacts for their future work. The results will provide a basis for future studies on better indicators and measures for assessing impact at the project level and across funding programs as well as directly impact current engineering programs.<br/><br/>This project is engaging the global engineering education community in creating a valid research impact framework for the field of engineering education that is inclusive of researchers and practitioners' perspectives on impact; and describing practitioners' insights on the role of research in engineering education practice. In an environment of increased accountability, engineering education researchers are being asked to identify the tangible impacts of their work on a regular basis. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of scholarship within and beyond engineering education on how to characterize the impact of research. A shared understanding among engineering education researchers and practitioners of what research impact looks like for this field lends itself to conversations on how engineering education research can influence practice. The engineering education research impact framework resulting from this study will draw broadly upon the perspectives of practitioners and researchers as well as existing research impact frameworks developed by other disciplines, including health sciences and science in general. As such, it will be robustly relevant across a wide range of engineering education research and practice activities. Workshops, interviews and recruitment procedures ensure representation of perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders and experts. The methodological approach to achieving the project goal adapts an instrument development procedure for framework development and validation, and will serve as the basis for a follow up study of an impact assessment. Because this project seeks to broadly and comprehensively define impact in the context of engineering education research, the resulting definition will extend beyond esoteric scientific impacts such as journals and academic communities to focus on the social impacts of engineering education and related research. Workshops engage a large number of community members in development, which positively impacts awareness, quality, robustness of usability/applicability, dissemination, buy in, and helps develop consensus in the community around impact. Additional efforts and interviews will ensure representation of practitioner perspectives in the resulting framework, even if these groups do not attend the engineering education conferences. This work may also inform initiatives around broader impacts in other engineering disciplines and across NSF."

The focus is on high-need rural areas in southeastern Georgia, in partner counties, that collectively are home to high populations of underrepresented minorities, economically disadvantaged and special needs students.  Target participants include those who are from historically underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines and those who teach in schools characterized by a high level of poverty and/or a high percentage of minority learners. ENERGY was specifically chosen as the research theme because it is a current national topic of direct interest to students and teachers, and it can be easily embedded in the high school STEM curriculum.  In addition, there are regional industries involved in hands-on, cutting edge engineering research projects in energy-related fields. The research topics for the RET participants in ENERGY include: renewable and alternative energy (solar, wind, biofuels, thermoelectric), development of sensors and controls for energy applications, biologically-inspired wind turbines and solar collectors.  As part of their engineering and scientific research projects, the teachers will be linked with real-world applications through collaborations with university and industry partners and will build upon long-term collaborative relationships between the participating school districts and the College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) at GSU. This research experience will give participants the ability to immerse themselves into various engineering disciplines, expand their knowledge of engineering through research in renewable energy while giving them concrete hands-on examples and pedagogical methods of incorporating engineering into STEM curricula.    <br/><br/>Over a three-year period the ENERGY RET Site will directly impact 30 STEM high school teachers, pre-service education majors, and community college faculty and approximately 4000 students. The goal of the ENERGY RET is to educate, engage, and inspire teachers to bring renewable energy to their classrooms through summer-term interdisciplinary STEM research experiences in the field of engineering and computer science.  The educational objectives of this program are to: increase basic understanding of interdisciplinary concepts through hands-on learning, introduce STEM problem-solving skills and the ability to apply them in lectures and laboratories, and to increase interest in conducting STEM research.  The program will develop the participants' ability to collaborate and communicate effectively at both the interpersonal and presentation level all while part of a diverse team.

It is expected that new curricula and school-wide transformations will have an impact on 5,000-10,000 students from high-need urban public high schools in the city of Milwaukee. The aim is to catalyze a sustainable RET network that empowers teachers to experiment and make STEM learning exciting, grants principals and administration license to support these experiments (and experiment themselves), and, through the industrial element of the program, build the kind of partnerships that would make learning more contextual and help support program growth. <br/><br/>This RET Site offers an intensive seven-week summer experience for 10 teachers per year beginning in late June and ending in early August. The teachers participate in highly structured, team-oriented research projects focused on the water-energy nexus research theme and academic-year curricular development activities. To provide support beyond the classroom, the program will also engage school principals. The teachers' professional development will include a Design Thinking boot camp, curriculum design mentoring, and avatar classroom training. Two RET network conferences will be held annually in which the teachers present their research projects and develop academic-year curriculum. During the first semester of the academic year, the teachers will implement the in-depth six- to eight-week curricular modules that they developed during the summer.  The RET site and its activities directly align with the Milwaukee Public Schools District's Comprehensive Math and Science Plan. It will be evaluated in quantitatively terms of participation, impact on students' knowledge and interest in engineering careers, and their mastery of core science concepts that are targeted by the Design Based Learning (DBL) units. By focusing on the water-energy nexus, a topic of broad social impact that is attractive to high school students, it is hoped that the serious economic issues in Milwaukee related to the continuous decline in the number of K-12 students (particularly females and under-represented minorities) who pursue STEM careers will be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nanotechnology seeks to develop and synthesize systems that manipulate, measure or control physical processes at the nanoscale, while integrated nanomanufacturing incorporates nanofabrication and materials research. The Boston University (BU) REU Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing will bring ten undergraduate students from universities and two-year colleges to engage in summer research in more than 30 potential interdisciplinary labs in Nanotechnology, Electrical and Computer, Biomedical, Materials Science, and/or Mechanical Engineering at the Boston University Charles River campus. The REU Site will offer an interdisciplinary and transformative experience to students from varying engineering disciplines that reflect the diversity of the BU mentors in Integrated Nanomanufacturing. The program's target is to recruit at least 50% of the 10 participants from underrepresented minorities and at least 50% female participants. Training female and underrepresented minorities from universities that have limited STEM research capabilities for graduate studies will provide the largest impact to diversifying future role models in nanotechnology. Participants will be immersed in research while simultaneously gaining an education in the proper techniques for research via mentored training from faculty and graduate students with clear learning goals agreed upon at the start of the program. The REU site program will be organized into various training sessions, hands-on cleanroom activities, scientific research in appointed laboratories and seminars for undergraduate research students. The Boston University NSF REU Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing will provide a program with the aim of educating a diverse group of the next generation of engineers in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>Participants will be mentored and coached through a unique problem-based research experience, from basic skills building to open-ended discovery, with a focus on developing research independence. Through the mentored training, participants will also engage in a training program of nanotechnology content, skills development, and career preparation with a focus on interdisciplinary engineering topics. Participants will also be immersed in a positive research culture in the mentor's laboratories and through the research mentoring training program that favorably shapes the mentee's and mentor's awareness, confidence and understanding of research, graduate school and other STEM career choices. Students will participate in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices, and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical and integrated nanoscale systems, while developing critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance along their career pathways in academics and research. Through this site, students will gain the opportunity to share their work with the research community at BU through presentations and to also submit to national conferences or co-author publications based on their research. Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this REU Site: 1) Materials synthesis and characterization, 2) Combination photonic and electronic nanostructures, and 3) Integration of nanosystems that generate, sense, and manipulate.<br/><br/>The project will emphasize the participation of underrepresented minority students, including novices (first and second year undergraduates) to establish primarily racial and ethnic, but also institutional, technical, and experiential diversity among the participants and to seed greater diversity in the national graduate student applicant pool. Recruiting will utilize strong existing relationships BU has with historically Black colleges and Universities (HBCU's) and Hispanic serving institutions (HSI's). Recruiting for this NSF REU site will also be concentrated on two-year colleges as well as four-year colleges that lack graduate research in STEM. As part of the REU site goals, a minimum of 50% of ten participants will be from colleges where graduate research opportunities in STEM are unavailable with a minimum of 50% underrepresented minorities and 50% female participants to be recruited. Undergraduate students who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Services will also be encouraged to apply.<br/><br/>The NSF REU site Integrated Nanomanufacturing has been funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC)."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>This planning grant will assemble a diverse multidisciplinary team, develop a comprehensive plan, and lay the groundwork for an NSF Engineering Research Center that designs and implements integrated systems and livable environments for responsive, efficient, and grid-independent local use of sunlight to sustainably meet ever-increasing human needs for energy and light. In other words, it will develop advanced self-sufficient solar-powered residential buildings that incorporate new and emerging technologies in novel ways. In the U.S., buildings account for about 40% of primary energy consumption, and 75% of electricity use. Residential buildings alone account for about 21% of energy consumption. Meanwhile, total residential energy consumption continues to rise despite efficiency gains driven by policy measures (e.g., Energy Star). Breaking through current limitations requires a broader approach to innovation that changes the way buildings generate and consume energy, not only to promote sustainability, but also to increase the resiliency of our energy infrastructure. Energy independence at the building or neighborhood level can protect against both natural and human-caused disruptions of energy supply while enabling greater integration of renewable resources. Thus, the planned Engineering Research Center will serve the national interest by making energy generation and consumption in buildings more sustainable, resilient, and secure. This benefits national prosperity and welfare while helping to secure the national defense by making the US energy infrastructure more robust. These aims will be achieved by advancing and integrating new materials and technologies, and will thus promote the progress of science in a way that directly benefits society.<br/><br/>The goal of this NSF Engineering Research Center planning grant is to assemble and integrate a world-class team of engineers, architects, scientists, and policy experts to advance and mature the vision for creating integrated systems and livable environments for responsive, efficient, and grid-independent local use of sunlight to sustainably meet ever-increasing human needs for energy and light. The planning grant will support team-building via professionally facilitated planning workshops with wraparound online activities that build communication and trust across geographic and disciplinary boundaries. Recurring planning meetings will be held throughout the grant period. A major public symposium is proposed to bring together ERC proposal partners, distinguished invited speakers, and students from SUNY at Buffalo (UB), partner institutions, and other institutions, particularly minority-serving institutions. A series of faculty-led half-day workshops will introduce the broader team to foundational values and perspectives of various disciplines represented on the team, furthering mutual understanding and trust across the team. Team leadership will travel to visit both existing successful ERCs and potential industrial partners. The team will engage with existing successful programs in education, outreach, and broadening participation at UB and partner institutions to identify best practices and opportunities for partnership. In all these activities the team will systematically gather ?voice of the customer? input from stakeholders ranging from researchers to companies to K-12 students to designers, builders, and potential occupants of future housing to be developed through the ERC. The team also will engage marketing, communication, and social science researchers to identify and effectively survey potential occupants, aiming to reach a true cross-section of Buffalo?s diverse population.  The proposed project will generate new scientific ideas, research directions, and applications thereof that address the gap between available and needed renewable energy. The project will significantly advance fundamental understanding of the informatics-driven development of transformative light (wavelength) converting materials that open new paradigms for harvesting and utilizing solar energy. It will generate ideas for next generation adaptive photovoltaic and thermal/illumination/disinfection systems to realize sustainable energy consumption and internet-of-things-based systems for large-scale adaptive control and optimization of energy flow. It will provide new concepts in residential architecture that lead us to reimagine ways in which buildings are designed, manufactured, and occupied in light of new materials and technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A novel aspect of the project is to help develop the use of engineering design and life skills, particularly for institutions in areas with high populations of black and Hispanic youth. For the purpose of advancing national prosperity, EYE PRIDE targets underrepresented minorities (URMs) that may not have a strong prior interest in engineering. Thus, the program addresses the problem of insufficient interest, preparation, and opportunities amongst black and Hispanic youth. In addition, the program explores the value of strong interpersonal relationships used to develop support systems, help raise awareness about engineering pathways, and reduce structural inequalities and biases. In the long term, the program aims to spark a cultural shift between USF and its surrounding community that ultimately may lead to a pipeline of URM students for future enrollment and the study of their matriculation. <br/><br/>The project considers engineering identity theory to examine the nexus between the engineering design process and literature on culturally responsive learning and mentoring. Activities will be particularly relevant for broadening participation of black and Hispanic youth in underserved populations. Using a mixed methods approach, the effects of the program on engineering identity and development of engineering skills of the following populations will be measured: 1) URM middle school students and 2) undergraduate engineering students and URM novice math/science teachers, who will serve as mentors. Activities are structured through the program's novel Plan, History, Act, Shift, Evaluate, Success (PHASES) design process that uses concepts from the culturally responsive learning literature, Next Generation Science Standards, and engineering design to concurrently teach both life skills and technical skills. The approach is particularly unique because of its basis in ""Topic Chaining"" which develops connections in three primary ways so learning is culturally relevant: traditional scaffolding to build upon simpler ideas, storytelling through a shared, interconnected narrative, and relevance to the practical realities of participants. After interventions are completed, the investigators plan to continue the mentor/mentee relationship and assessing the skill development and engineering identity growth over time."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Microbes have co-evolved over millions of years and assembled in highly optimized microbial communities (microbiomes). Over the last several decades scientists have begun to discover the power microbiomes harness and how microbiomes could be leveraged to benefit society. While some successes have been achieved in translating the growing fundamental scientific knowledge linking microbiomes to practical applications, in general, a systematic and replicable framework is needed for consistently bridging the gap between fundamental scientific discovery and technology development. This planning grant will create the visionary platform and collaborative network to establish an Engineering Research Center for Precision Microbiome Engineering (PreMiEr) that will enable engineers, microbiologists and other natural scientists to work alongside theorists, model builders and computational scientists to develop integrative models that will serve as the foundation for engineering discovery and application to develop a broad range of technologies designed to address global challenges in agriculture, environment, health and energy. PreMiEr's research activities will enable microbiome manipulation to promote beneficial microbes such as those that restore ecological function by degrading toxic soil pollutants, improving crop yield by increasing stress tolerance, decreasing our reliance on fossil fuel by producing biofuels and weakening undesirable microbes such as those that destroy crops and contribute to disease. PreMiEr will shift microbiome research from a descriptive to a predictive framework, a shift which is key to advancing microbiome engineering, promoting engineering innovation and facilitating research translation. Furthermore, by incorporating social scientists into the PreMiEr research framework, non-social scientists' work will be informed by consideration of the ethical and policy implications of their evolving microbiome engineering discoveries. Creation and integration of these activities will result in an accelerated research translation process designed to speed up bench to market time.<br/><br/>This planning grant combines Core Vision Leadership Team brainstorming and integration meetings with four catalytic accelerator workshops, mapped to PreMiEr's four research themes (Environment, Agriculture, Health and Energy) which will deliver a transdisciplinary research and societal impacts agenda and identify the broader team partners and expertise that is critical to the formation and success of this Center. The expected benefits of the planning activities include: 1) crystallizing PreMiEr's engineering research themes, thrusts and cores; 2) defining a transformative agenda designed to advance microbiome research from descriptive to mechanistic to application studies; 3) creating structure for successful translation of PreMiEr's research; 4) defining critical societal impacts linked with an assessment plan that incorporates evolving international standards on relevant societal impact indicators; and 5) designing an inclusive PreMiEr training structure to broaden STEM participation and enhance domestic and global workforce development. PreMiEr's research design, informed by research-stakeholder team input, will directly impact society?s ability to supply food, energy and clean water while maintaining and improving the health of our population and ecosystems. In addition, through active recruitment of trainees from underrepresented groups and expanded collaborative partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs, PreMiEr will contribute to broadening diversity across the US STEM workforce and training the next generation in interdisciplinary technical and professional skills to compete in the emerging arena of convergence science. Finally, the translation of this planning initiative into a proposed engineering research center will provide a model for the development of other future convergence science centers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern U.S. and the world are threatened by dwindling usable water supplies, driven by drought, growing and competing demands, and increasing salinity.  Many of the U.S./Mexico border States, and especially the Colorado and Rio Grande river basins, face a future water crisis that includes increasingly frequent and severe periods of drought and growing demands for water in the urban, agricultural, and environmental sectors. The ?siloed?, piecemeal water management approach of the past 100 years is unable to sustain our cities and farms in the future, while meeting environmental and social concerns, as well.  We need a ?One Water? management approach, one that is holistic, comprehensive and integrated to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  We propose here a novel, innovative, and convergent planning process to develop a team of engineers, scientists, and stakeholders with a unified understanding of water sectors, problems, and solutions and a shared vision for the One Water Engineering Research Center that will generate new technical discoveries with broad societal impact.  We will meet the water challenges of our water scarce region while training the water resource professionals of the future.  <br/>    <br/>    Our goal is to formulate and implement a planning process that is informed by recent NSF-funded basic research on team science and convergent learning across disciplines and perspectives. This process will provide a model for how to effectively lead convergent research teams during their early, formative stage. With a strategic series of stakeholder focus group meetings, researcher summit meetings, and researcher working meetings, we will generate a shared vision among researchers and stakeholders of a new kind of ERC ? one that catalyzes transformative innovations through the synergies created by deeply integrating diverse perspectives. The product will be a proposal for a One Water approach to the management of water on a landscape scale, one that integrates the needs of all sectors of water users with social and environmental needs.  The convergent product of this planning grant will be an integrated team with a dynamic system understanding that will serve as the roadmap for future water management.  Our vision for the One Water Center is that it will provide the strong underpinning of water research, engineering, management, education, and outreach needed to develop this roadmap, one that is based on innovation and cutting-edge science and technology, to solve the seemingly intractable problems of meeting the water needs of all major use sectors in the coming decades.  Our testbed for this One Water Approach will be the Paso del Norte region of the U.S./Mexico border, a particularly challenged arid region threatened by water scarcity, climate, competing demands for water, high rates of poverty, and a complex water governance system including an international border and multiple state and local jurisdictions.  The results will be widely applicable to other arid and semi-arid regions of the world where water scarcity is a source of local and even global conflict.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many regions of the country are experiencing periodic water shortages and historic droughts that have created unprecedented stress on water resources and pushed re-thinking of water supply options.  Such shortages, coupled with the high cost of operating and maintaining existing water infrastructure, threaten economic growth, social welfare and national security and underscore the urgent need to transform America's water infrastructure. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Stanford University, hosted by the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt), aims to create a new paradigm for safe, sustainable management of urban water.  A unique interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduates will immerse diverse and talented cohorts of students from a variety of institutions, particularly those with limited or no research opportunities, in ReNUWIt research groups, working on projects related to managed natural systems and efficient engineered systems. This program will increase undergraduate students' interests in pursuing advanced degrees in water science engineering, with a particular emphasis on women and minorities.<br/><br/>This REU Site offers undergraduates, in collaboration with ReNUWIt faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, opportunities to conduct hands-on research during a 9-week summer program, using cross-disciplinary, systems level approaches that directly address the design of urban water infrastructure and key knowledge gaps in water science/engineering. The program will take place at the four ReNUWIt partner institution campuses located at: Stanford University, University of California at Berkeley, Colorado School of Mines, and New Mexico State University. In addition, to conducting research the students will participate in a range of activities outside the lab to learn more about the wider research community and to hone the skills needed to become successful contributors to the community. These include: 1) All REU Meeting on the Stanford campus. 2) Weekly videoconferences with REU students at partner institutions 3)Professional development workshops on technical writing, oral presentations, career options. and ethics. 4) Interaction with members of ReNUWIt's Industrial Affiliates Board and Innovation Partners. Products created by the REU students at the end of the summary-abstracts and summary graphics-will be displayed in the online ReNUWIt REU gallery for wide dissemination. Some of the REU students will also present their work at national and international conferences."

Research in Engineered Bioactive Interfaces and Devices focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response.  These advanced architectures have numerous applications including tissue engineering, sensing systems, and drug delivery.  Students will be recruited from various undergraduate disciplines including engineering, biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.   Surrounding the University of Kentucky are numerous regional colleges and universities that have no graduate programs in these areas.  Recruitment at these institutions will encourage students that may not otherwise pursue an advanced degree.   In addition, recruitment for the program will focus on national institutions that do not have graduate programs.  Special efforts will be made to attract women and minorities to this program by recruiting at minority institutions and publicizing the program at national meetings of minority and women organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers.  Students accepted into the program will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. The proposed REU program builds on these successful collaborations and integrates them with other educational components, such as seminars, workshops, and other technical and social activities.  The students will be exposed to the excitement of interdisciplinary research and by the end of the program will have an excellent knowledge of what is involved in graduate research. <br/><br/><br/>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The area of Engineered Bioactive Interfaces focuses on the novel design of architectures that interact with biological systems and promote a desired response.   The need for this cross-disciplinary interaction between investigators working in biological systems and those creating novel engineered synthetic architectures has long been recognized.   These advanced architectures have numerous applications ranging from tissue engineering to sensing systems to drug delivery.   Successful development of these systems will depend on expertise not only in developing novel synthetic architectures through nanotechnology, self-assembly and hybrid systems but also on the interactions of these interfaces with biological systems such as cells and proteins.   As part of the REU program, the undergraduate students will have the opportunity to learn about three cross-disciplinary research themes that form the foundation of the research in this area.  These areas include 1) ""Novel Bioactive Architectures"", 2) ""Cell/Protein Interactions at Interfaces"", and 3) ""Integration into Devices"".  The students will work closely with faculty and graduate students who are currently engaged in collaborative, cross-disciplinary research across these three themes further supporting a highly multidisciplinary team research approach.  This REU Program will not only provide the students with true interdisciplinary mentoring and research training but will also stimulate the students' interests in Ph.D. careers in science and engineering through seminars, field trips and interactions with both graduate students and faculty, and will develop the students independence and confidence through participation in research and presentations both in house and at scientific meetings. <br/><br/><br/>Acknowledgements:  Support for this Program is provided by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers."

Using a theoretical framework of practice-linked identities, the project also examines the complex relation between African American male students' engagement, learning, and identity formation in the context of three different engineering learning environments: elementary school, middle school, and undergraduate engineering. The project also involves developing case studies of students' engagement with engineering design practices within each context and comparing students' experiences across contexts. The findings are likely to influence how schools, especially educators, conceptualize Next Generation Science Standard practices, thus opening up these practices to more multifaceted ways of talking, thinking, and engaging and highlighting critical aspects of identity work in these settings. The merit of this project lies in the continued need for research that positively impacts the recruitment and retention of engineering students, particularly from underrepresented communities. By focusing on African American males, the project extends the understandings of the ways in which they may develop engineering practice competencies and identities. Further, the project is likely to contribute to the engineering education community's understanding of the development of engineering identities and the different features within learning environments that foster the formation and transformation of these identities. <br/><br/>The key project objectives are the research and educational activities are the following:(a)examine and characterize the relationship between African American males' engineering practice competencies and identities; (b)examine and characterize elements within engineering learning environments that impact African American males' developing competencies and identities; and (c)develop hypotheses for the design of expansive engineering learning spaces for increasing African American males' competencies and identities. The project is unique in its approach to exploring the complex relationship between students' engineering engagement, learning, and identity formation to understand expansive learning ecologies in engineering for African American males. The strong emphasis on the design of equitable learning spaces within engineering education will provide additional insights that can more broadly impact the academic community."

A recent United Nations report projects that virtually every nation will face a water supply problem within the next 20 years. A key component to any solution to address water-related challenges is to educate our youth about the interdisciplinary aspects of water research to make them aware of water-related issues; and to train them as future professionals who will develop appropriate solutions to meet these challenges. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site, entitled Water ECubeG (Engineering, Ecology, Environment, Geosciences) at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) is targeted at developing a model 6-week professional development program to engage grades 9-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty in Southwest Virginia in interdisciplinary water research. Successful implementation of this RET Site will result in the development of innovative learning modules that will motivate students in grades 9-12 and community colleges to pursue the breadth of water related STEM careers. The proposed region for teacher recruitment will enable many teachers to educate a diverse group of students throughout Southwest Virginia serving high-need rural and urban student populations. The Site's focus on interdisciplinary water research will enable early exposure of future scientists and engineers to critical issues for solving complex water problems such as pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. The goal of this Site is consistent with the priorities identified by the Virginia Governor's office and upon successful completion this Site will serve as an excellent model for teacher and student training in interdisciplinary water research elsewhere. <br/><br/>Over a three-year period this RET Site will offer an intensive summer interdisciplinary water research experience to a total of 30 STEM precollege teachers and community college faculty. The specific objectives are to: (1) Develop and implement a 6-week research experience program for RET Site participants involving hands-on learning experiences in engineering, ecology, environment, and geosciences, (2) Develop and implement a professional development program for teachers, (3) Guide RET Site participants in developing and implementing STEM-based interdisciplinary water research learning modules for their curricula, and (4) Establish a community of teachers mentored in interdisciplinary water research for support, collaboration, and dissemination of Site activities to a larger group of teachers. Annual workshops will be held by RET alumni to educate and motivate additional 9-12 STEM teachers and community college faculty. RET participants will present their work at K-12 and Community College conferences. The project outcomes will be published through the TeachEngineering digital library."

Researchers have identified Statics as a major impediment for students to succeed in follow-on core courses (therefore affecting retention in engineering) as well as on practical design capstone courses. It is known that students enter Statics with misconceptions that are not corrected through traditional instruction. This project investigates the use of feedback devices, known as haptics, in which students can manipulate a computer-generated structure and feel the forces that are generated. It is hypothesized that the use of the haptic device will provide students specific feedback to help them develop a better conceptual understanding of Statics. This project targets a foundational topic in engineering education known to significantly affect both future performance and retention. The results of this research are broadly relevant to institutions and their students, as essentially all students in mechanical, civil, aerospace, and biomedical disciplines take Statics. Similarly, the products of this research inform learning interventions in related concepts in science and engineering (e.g., buoyancy, electricity and magnetism, and dynamics, among others).<br/><br/>This research advances understanding of haptic-mediated learning by exploring specific affordances and constraints of visuo-haptic simulations in a laboratory experiment emphasizing statics misconceptions. Visuo-haptic simulation using force-feedback devices for education is timely, yet understudied. This research significantly extends the community's understanding of the affordances and constraints of using haptic devices for teaching difficult concepts. Following a design-based research approach, this project develops new knowledge about how haptic-based learning experiences can mediate conceptual understanding and representational competence of difficult concepts in statics. It investigates how we can best use touch technologies to help students connect system behaviors in terms of governing forces and their different representational forms. This proposal focuses on the following specific research questions (RQs): <br/>1. To what extent do haptic-based learning experiences improve student conceptual understanding and representational fluency? Working hypothesis: the force feedback of haptic devices reinforces representations (mathematical, visual) of mechanics systems and improves conceptual understanding. <br/>2. How do the short-term, long-term, and transfer learning gains between visual-only-enhanced, physical manipulative-enhanced, and haptic-enhanced learning activities compare? Working hypothesis: students experience greater learning gains when instruction includes haptic devices. <br/>3. What are the differences in students' explanations and representations of experienced phenomena before and after using the haptic-based learning experiences? Working hypothesis: haptic devices and learning experiences provide a new platform on which students can build understanding, and provide a new vocabulary for articulating device structure, function, and performance. <br/><br/>The newly derived knowledge will inform our understanding about how students ""learn by touch"" as well as our understanding of the interplay between conceptual understanding and representational competence. Our long-term goal is to identify the extent to which interacting with haptic-based learning experiences (HABLE) mediates students' conceptual understanding and representational fluency of difficult concepts in statics."

Faculty of color represent an alarmingly small, untapped and underserved population in the academic ranks within engineering. This state of affairs informs the goals of the proposed project, which is to enhance the presence, socialization, retention and advancement of junior and mid-career faculty from underrepresented populations in engineering. The project seeks to achieve these goals via the following objectives: 1) development and implementation of a holistic array of career development initiatives for underrepresented early and mid-career faculty; and 2) implementation of research on practices and policies impacting the progression and advancement of these faculty members. The project includes a professional/leadership development component, informed by existing knowledge on the factors that help underrepresented faculty members succeed. There is also a research component that is intended to add to the national knowledge base on issues of career progression. <br/><br/>Key features of the project include: an annual professional/leadership development symposium, the formation of an on-line community (e.g., using the NSF-funded National Institute for Faculty Equity website, webinars, etc.), organized networking at professional society meetings, the active engagement of senior scholars and opportunities for multi-year participation. Additionally, the symposium will be used as a forum to implement a mixed-methods study of the factors influencing underrepresented faculty members' experiences in academia. In this vein, the project will explore the following research questions: <br/><br/>RQ1. What individual and systemic factors are facilitating and/or hindering the progression and advancement of URM faculty members?<br/>RQ2. What are the salient intragroup differences in the experiences of URM faculty? (e.g., How do foreign-born Black faculty members experience the academy differently than their US-born peers? How do the experiences of Hispanic faculty members differ based on their country of origin?)<br/>RQ3. How do URM faculty members' past professional development experiences impact their present day responses to challenges and opportunities?<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the success and advancement of minority faculty in engineering, thereby enhancing their participation and retention, and increasing their ranks. The increased presence of these minorities enhances faculty diversity and provides the role models and self images that contribute to the enhanced recruitment, retention, and ultimate success of all students -- especially those from groups underrepresented in the engineering workforce -- which is necessary to build a diverse science and engineering workforce required to maintain national competitiveness and prosperity."

Peer review is a key site of social construction of knowledge and micropolitics of knowledge production. It serves as a gateway for new knowledge to become part of a field. As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, engineering education research presents a valuable, and timely, opportunity to learn about processes of disciplinary development, and to better understand the micropolitics of peer review in an emerging and interdisciplinary field. Moreover, in engineering education research, the boundaries of the field can have implications for insights that ultimately influence engineering education practices. As a relatively new field, it has been noted that engineering education research remains underdeveloped in some regards, including inclusion of theoretical and methodological approaches from social science fields. However, little research has been done to identify how the boundaries of the field are established and maintained. This study is the first investigation of a large group of engineering education researchers' peer review experiences and editors' perspectives. <br/>  <br/>The research objective of this project is to identify research normativities and values shaping the emerging field of engineering education research through the peer review processes. The intervention objective of this project is to develop and implement materials targeted to engineering education researchers so that they better understand their field and how it can be advanced in new directions. In-depth qualitative interviews are being conducted with 40 authors and at least 5 editors of the Journal of Engineering Education. Authors include those who have had articles published and those who have had articles rejected, as well as those who fall into both categories. The interviews explore participants' peer review experiences and beliefs about the field's boundaries. Emergent patterns in experiences and beliefs will be used to identify theoretical, methodological, epistemological, and topical normativities that shape the field. These patterns provide new insights into engineering education research, specifically, its dominant values, boundaries, and levels of interdisciplinarity, thus also providing new insights into the social construction of knowledge in an emerging, interdisciplinary field. Based on findings from the interviews, stakeholder-specific workshops are being conducted for different groups: current and future engineering education researchers. These workshops and associated materials are designed to help the engineering education research community critically reflect on and advance the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, little is understood about how UREs affect students' views of research, their identities as researchers, and their beliefs about knowledge in engineering. Investigating students' researcher identities and beliefs about knowledge (epistemic beliefs) in the context of URE is important because they shape the students' perceptions, values, and interactions with others, which can then be translated to their classes and future careers. The outcomes of this study help develop meaningful ways for students to engage, function, and learn in research spaces as well as classrooms and laboratories. Findings also expand theories about identity and epistemic beliefs in ways that are specific to engineering fields. The goal of the project is to address the challenge of producing engineers who are well-equipped to tackle complex, ill-defined, and open-ended problems similar to those encountered when doing research. The results enable engineering educators to provide novel educational experiences, developing students as future researchers and engineers such that these experiences will have long term impacts. The project's broader impacts include benefits to fields beyond engineering that engage students in research. Also, by including diverse student populations in the study, a deeper understanding is gained about how students from different backgrounds, engineering fields, and types of institutions experience and benefit from participating in research.<br/><br/>The overarching research question for this project is: How do undergraduate engineering students develop their identities as researchers and their ways of knowing engineering through research experiences?  There are four specific aims of this project. The first is to understand how undergraduate engineering students conceptualize and construct what it means to be a researcher. The second is to discover what factors the students think affect their researcher identity development. The third is to find out how these students describe what it means to know something in their fields. The fourth is to understand how students form their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing during research experiences. A grounded theory approach is used to expand existing identity and epistemic belief frameworks to develop a theory within the context of research experiences in engineering. The three-phase study uses open-ended surveys and interviews to identify themes that answer the research aims and can be used to develop workshops. The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing an engineering-specific learning theory based on students' beliefs about ways of knowing and their identities as researchers. This theory is used to inform and work with engineering educators to find ways to apply research findings in engineering degree programs and UREs.  Workshops for engineering educators focus on ways to incorporate the aspects of UREs that help build students' ways of knowing and their identities as participants in their research communities and their engineering fields."

Luthy,<br/>PI, Stanford Univ., Lead; Univ. of California, Berkeley; Colorado School of Mines; New Mexico State Univ.<br/>Foreign Partners: Nanyang Technological Univ., Singapore; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science<br/>and Technology, Dubendorf, Switzerland; Univ. of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.<br/>Vision and Goals. Cities are facing a mounting water crisis from climate change, population expansion,<br/>ecosystem demands and deteriorating infrastructure that threatens economic development, social<br/>welfare, and environmental sustainability. Without relatively large investments this crisis will only deepen<br/>through the 21st century. Accordingly, the goal of the proposed ERC is to advance new strategies for<br/>water/wastewater treatment and distribution that will eliminate the need for imported water, recover<br/>resources from wastewater, and generate rather than consume energy in the operation of urban water<br/>infrastructure while simultaneously enhancing urban aquatic ecosystems. While many existing<br/>approaches could be used to transition urban water infrastructure to this more sustainable state, their<br/>implementation currently is limited by uncertainties about their long-term performance, life cycle costs,<br/>institutional impediments and public concerns about unfamiliar technologies. In some cases, the<br/>technologies needed to realize our vision do not yet exist and technological breakthroughs are needed.<br/>To meet these challenges, our strategic planning process identified key research projects within three<br/>thrust areas:<br/>(1) Engineered Water Systems: Decrease reliance on inefficient centralized treatment systems by<br/>employing distributed treatment systems that embrace water conservation, local use of alternative<br/>supplies, energy management, nutrient recovery, and that integrate with existing infrastructure;<br/>(2) Managed Natural Systems: Integrate managed natural systems into water infrastructure to fully<br/>realize the potential benefits that natural systems can provide with respect to water storage and<br/>improvement of water quality, while simultaneously rehabilitating urban hydrology and aquatic habitat;<br/>(3) Systems Integration and Institutions: Support the reinvention and restoration of urban water<br/>systems through the development of decision-making tools that account for economic, environmental<br/>and social factors and development of approaches that can circumvent impediments to change posed<br/>by regulations, laws, jurisdictional fragmentation, financing and public perception.<br/>The ERC will conduct short-term research to facilitate adoption of existing technologies that have the<br/>potential to improve system performance and long-term research on technologies that can fundamentally<br/>transform urban water infrastructure. Regardless of timing, all of the research will be targeted at<br/>understanding how new technologies and management strategies affect the performance of complex<br/>urban water infrastructure systems.<br/>Intellectual Merit. The proposed ERC joins four leading universities in the West and three international<br/>universities at the forefront of urban water infrastructure research. Although increased demands on water<br/>supplies occur throughout the country, these demands are acute in the arid West, where the ERC partner<br/>universities have special capabilities and access to unique test beds. Furthermore, each campus has<br/>strategic collaborations with members of the professional community and international research partners<br/>that will help us to translate our research into tangible results. Through a combination of innovative<br/>research, systems analysis and meaningful collaborations with stakeholders, we will ensure a more rapid<br/>reinvention of urban water infrastructure in a manner that is sustainable, safe and cost-effective.<br/>Broader Impacts. Technology transfer of the ERC?s research will occur through close involvement of end<br/>users. Public and private water service providers, government representatives, equipment manufacturers,<br/>and technologists will actively participate in the ERC to ensure the research is influential in decisions<br/>about urban water infrastructure operation and renewal. To support the development of innovative new<br/>technologies, we will establish a center within the ERC to provide cutting-edge evaluations of devices<br/>developed by small companies with the aim of improving products and fostering development of start-ups.<br/>The ERC's outreach will build a pipeline of diverse, well-prepared students who eventually pursue<br/>and complete water-related degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level?becoming leaders and<br/>supporting significant change in the Nation?s water infrastructure in a manner that is guided by scientific<br/>knowledge and whose efforts are supported by an informed public. Each component of the education and<br/>outreach plan feeds directly into the attainment of this vision beginning at the elementary level and<br/>continuing through graduate education. To ensure the involvement of under-represented minorities, the<br/>ERC is partnered with American Indian Tribal Colleges and Universities, and K-8 and high schools that<br/>target districts that serve primarily Latino, Pacific Islander and African American populations"

This challenging issue has been addressed over the past few decades with limited success, due in part to the complex and interrelated factors that influence the career advancement of underrepresented minority faculty. Strategies are needed to increase the numbers and career success of underrepresented minority faculty, to ensure diversity in engineering and national competitiveness.<br/><br/>The goals and activities are closely aligned with NSF's mission to broaden the participation and success of underrepresented populations in engineering. Faculty of color represent an alarmingly small, untapped and underserved population in the academic ranks within engineering. This state of affairs informs the goals of the proposed project, which is to enhance the presence, socialization, retention and advancement of junior and mid-career faculty from underrepresented populations in engineering. The project seeks to achieve these goals via the following objectives: 1) development and implementation of a holistic array of career development initiatives for underrepresented early and mid-career faculty; and 2) implementation of research on practices and policies impacting the progression and advancement of these faculty members. The project includes a professional/leadership development component, informed by existing knowledge on the factors that help underrepresented faculty members succeed. There is also a research component that is intended to add to the national knowledge base on issues of career progression. <br/><br/>Key features of the project include: an annual professional/leadership development symposium, the formation of an on-line community (e.g., using the NSF-funded National Institute for Faculty Equity website, webinars, etc.), organized networking at professional society meetings, the active engagement of senior scholars and opportunities for multi-year participation. Additionally, the symposium will be used as a forum to implement a mixed-methods study of the factors influencing underrepresented faculty members' experiences in academia. In this vein, the project will explore the following research questions: <br/><br/>RQ1. What individual and systemic factors are facilitating and/or hindering the progression and advancement of URM faculty members?<br/>RQ2. What are the salient intragroup differences in the experiences of URM faculty? (e.g., How do foreign-born Black faculty members experience the academy differently than their US-born peers? How do the experiences of Hispanic faculty members differ based on their country of origin?)<br/>RQ3. How do URM faculty members' past professional development experiences impact their present day responses to challenges and opportunities?<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the success and advancement of minority faculty in engineering, thereby enhancing their participation and retention, and increasing their ranks. The increased presence of these minorities enhances faculty diversity and provides the role models and self images that contribute to the enhanced recruitment, retention, and ultimate success of all students -- especially those from groups underrepresented in the engineering workforce -- which is necessary to build a diverse science and engineering workforce required to maintain national competitiveness and prosperity."

They may also play a strong role in retention and degree completion among underrepresented student groups (for instance women, minorities, those with disabilities). While the benefits of participation are relatively well established, the reasons why students choose to participate or not in the first place are very poorly understood, as they may span a wide spectrum and may not involve fully informed or rational foundations for decision-making. Failure to understand student choices limits our ability to address barriers to participation, and to structure campus programs and their funding to achieve outcomes that include improved diversity and a higher quality of technical and interpersonal learning in project teams. This research involves generating significant new insight into why students choose to participate in co-curricular engineering projects, through use of a mixture of surveys and more detailed interviews with students in different types of universities. The research is designed to yield insight into whether influential decision-making factors and attitudes are consistent across demographic groups or if there are unique gender, ethnicity, social, or socio-economic -related responses that may in turn influence the makeup of co-curricular student project teams. The results will improve the understanding of student motivations and perceptions, including to what extent students consciously evaluate potential trade-offs and consequences of making one choice over another. <br/><br/>The survey of students, complemented by interviews for richer depth, uses a Q-Methodology and phenomenological interpretation of student motivations and perceptions when choosing to join (or leave) such projects. The research applies well-established social science approaches to investigate a highly under-studied area in engineering formation. Recent survey tools - developed with NSF funding - designed to explore student co- and extra-curricular engagement are being adopted for the Q Methodology. The Theory of Planned Behavior is being applied to analyze and contextualize the student responses and link them to key underlying attitudes, factors, and processes that influence student participation in co-curricular engineering projects. It is anticipated that predictions of future student involvement can be made based on characteristic responses that will emerge. Students who chose to participate, students who participated and left, and students who never decided to participate in co-curricular projects will be sampled. The project brings together a team with extensive experience in the co-curricular engineering project arena, including engagement on issues of underrepresentation, self-efficacy, and professional formation. Both undergraduate and graduate students, including those from engineering and teaching, are receiving valuable research training in engineering education as part of this research.  It is anticipated that the outcomes could help guide campus culture, structure, and funding decisions to enhance the number and diversity of students gaining valuable co-curricular project experience before entering the STEM workforce."

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.<br/><br/>A two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of its importance to workforce development, national security, and economic prosperity, there is a pressing need to fund broadening participation educational research with strong intellectual merit and that render findings that can be used to broadening participation throughout the engineering enterprise. This CAREER research project is motivated by the need to develop practical strategies and frameworks for helping underrepresented students successfully navigate hidden curriculum that often deter or impede their academic persistence in engineering degree programs. Research findings are likely to inform the engineering education community about negative impacts of hidden curriculum on underrepresented students' academic persistence in engineering and how to create a more inclusive engineering academic culture for all students. In engineering, there is strong need to better understand the academic and social challenges that underrepresented students often face in engineering degree programs. Conducting research studies, such as this, offers immense potential to transform engineering education and engineering practice for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>This CAREER research project proposes to utilize a mixed-method, multi-institutional approach to study hidden curriculum in engineer degree programs and these curricula the motivations (i.e., emotions and self-efficacy), behaviors, and actions of engineering faculty and students at three Hispanic Serving Institutions, one Historically Black College and University, and one Predominantly White Institution. This research study comprises three phases: (a) an early stage exploratory study, (b) a design and development study, and (c) an efficacy study. More specifically, Phase 1 consists of conducting a quantitative study in civil engineering across different institutional types and classifications of institutions of higher education. Three unique surveys - focused on HC in engineering and the motivations, behaviors, and actions of engineering faculty and students - will be developed and validated. Phase 2 involves developing a set of custom-made advocacy mentoring training materials for each institution through member-checking qualitative interviews. Phase 3 focuses on expanding the project to other engineering specialties, beyond civil engineering, for each of the targeted institutions of higher learning. By including a targeted population first, followed by a wider spectrum of engineering disciplines, the findings from this project are likely to result in increased generalizability and transferability of the findings that could be used to improve engineering retention and graduation rates among underrepresented groups."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research. This planning grant will develop well-formulated plans for a future Engineering Research Center that result in quantifiable improvements in health and well-being in cities through the systematic development and deployment of heat-mitigation strategies that address key technological, social, political, and economic challenges.  The team proposes a comprehensive multi- disciplinary approach for understanding and addressing the emerging convergent challenges to the urban thermal environment.  Continuing growth is resulting in more and larger sources of anthropogenic waste heat, which is released in the urban environment. The understanding and pro-active mitigation of these effects to allow continued growth requires the involvement of physical and social scientists, engineers, public policy experts, city and regional planners, and climatologists.  Implementation of any new approaches requires engagement with industry, city administration, and the public at large.  Current efforts have focused on controlling the solar absorptivity of building exteriors and pavements, and the planting of vegetation.  Model predictive control, and real time mitigation of anthropogenic heat release have not been attempted in a systematic manner, and will be the focus of the proposed multi-pronged effort to manage heat stress and enhance the livability of urban areas.  The team to undertake this convergent research collaboration will be assembled during the planning grant using team science approaches, and will involve universities with complementary expertise, national laboratories, industry, city governments, and other stakeholders.  During the planning grant, a roadmap for the proposed activities will also be developed, including experimental demonstrations of the proposed concepts in test beds at scale in representative urban environments.<br/><br/>The planning activities will help develop four interconnected thrusts.  Multi-scale transient modeling of the urban thermal environment, including the effects of anthropogenic heat sources will be achieved by coupling regional meteorological models with experimentally validated finer resolution microscale urban area to achieve real-time coupled, or feed-forward models.  This requires addressing the multiple challenges associated with performing this coupling, e.g., inconsistencies in model physics, model inputs, and parameterizations across scales.  The ability of these models for near real time heat exposure predictions will be explored.  The impact of various strategies for management of anthropogenic heat, including thermal storage, and air flow management will be explored.  In addition to controlling anthropogenic sources of waste heat, adaptive thermal properties for buildings, pavements, and green spaces represent an innovative new mechanism for managing the urban thermal environment. <br/><br/>The annual mean air temperature of a city of 1 million can be 1-3 degrees Centigrade warmer than its surroundings, with the evening differences as high as 12 degrees Centigrade.  With extreme heat accounting for more weather-related deaths each year than any other form of extreme weather, urban populations are disproportionately impacted by rising temperatures. Urban heat islands further result in increased summertime energy usage, higher air-conditioning costs, increased air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as degradation of water quality.  A key contributor to the urban air temperature rise is anthropogenic heat release from building heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems, transportation systems, and industrial processes' activities that could be managed to lessen heat exposure with real-time information on temperatures across cities. Without active mitigation strategies, continued growth of urban areas poses increasing health and quality of life challenges for urban populations, as well as sharply growing energy demand.   The proposed ERC will focus on developing a systematic framework to characterize and control the urban thermal environments, to enhance emergency response operations during heat wave events, to contribute to the health and quality of life of the inhabitants, and to reduce primary energy consumption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The misalignment between the engineering classroom and workplace poses serious challenges with the professional formation of engineers. Generally speaking, capstone courses are key academic experiences that can bridge these gaps. Few studies, if any, have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses in helping students make the transition from engineering classrooms to the workplace. Instead, most research focuses on course structure, pedagogy, assessment, and end-of-course outcomes. To address the knowledge gaps, the investigators draw on Wenger's concept of communities of practice to study students' experiences as they move from capstone courses to the workplace. <br/><br/>Using a multi-case study design, the project is focusing on four primary research questions: <br/>(a) What skills, practices, and attitudes fostered through the capstone experience do individuals draw on or apply in their early work experiences? <br/>(b) What differences do individuals identify between their capstone design and early work experiences, and how do those differences help or hinder their school-to-work transition?<br/>(c) What specific pedagogical practices or aspects of the capstone course do students identify as helping or hindering their transition?<br/>(d) In what ways do individuals perceive themselves to be underprepared in their early work experiences? <br/><br/>Further, with a particular focus on women and Hispanics, the investigators proposed to study the extent that capstone design courses prepared these students to enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. This project is closely aligned with the National Science Foundation's strategic priorities to build the STEM workforce with capable individuals, as well as broadening participation in engineering among underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>In the scientific literature, there are numerous studies that highlight the gaps between theory and practice in relation to engineering education and the workplace, yet capstone courses are common practices that engineering instructors use to help students gain more in-depth engineering knowledge. There is a dearth of studies that have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses and how these courses may help students to translate and apply prior engineering coursework to the engineering workplace. With this in mind, this project has immense potential to positively impact engineering instruction across the nation. It also possesses great potential in helping engineering faculty to develop more effective capstone courses, while maximizing their instructional resources to create such courses. Ultimately, this project will benefit U.S. engineering industries seeking to hire adaptable engineering graduates who are technically and professionally prepared to enter the engineering workforce."

The number of people with disabilities will increase in the United States in the coming decades due to an aging population and advances in medicine that extend the lives of people with chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes) and victims of traumatic accidents (e.g., car crashes). Despite the national need for rehabilitation technology, opportunities to enter the field of rehabilitation engineering are limited for many students and there is a critical need to increase and diversify the population of students equipped to pursue careers in rehabilitation engineering and assistive technology. Therefore the overall objectives of this project are to:  1) Immerse a diverse group of undergraduate engineering and computer science students in the challenges of developing technology to restore daily function to people who have limited ability to move their arms and legs. 2) Motivate students to pursue future opportunities in rehabilitation and assistive technology. 3) Empower students to succeed in careers in rehabilitation and assistive technology.  <br/><br/>Over a three year period, the ECRAT program will engage undergraduates students in a 10-week intensive, original and creative hands-on summer research and professional development/training experience centered around integrated learning communities that surround REU students with their peers, their mentors, medical professionals, and people with disabilities. The project's outcomes will be a diverse group of students motivated and prepared to pursue careers in rehabilitation and assistive technology and a structured program in immersing students in rehabilitation research that can be disseminated across the country."

At best, engineering remains approximately 80% male, which is particularly concerning given the national need for more engineers. Prior studies have found that one of the major roadblocks to increasing women's representation in engineering is the fact that compared to boys, girls express very low levels of interest in engineering from early ages, and ultimately are unlikely to choose to pursue engineering majors in college despite having strong educational backgrounds in math and science. Therefore, the factors that likely discourage girls' interest in engineering appear social and psychological in nature, rather than academic. To examine these factors in detail, this unique study will follow a large group of high school girls who have already expressed an interest in engineering, with the goal of understanding how the support of adults and peers in their lives, as well as girls' own views about gender roles, influence whether or not they remain interested in the field and ultimately choose an engineering major in college. By shedding light on the factors that support girls' pursuit of engineering, as well as those that function as deterrents, valuable insight can be gathered that can then be leveraged to better support a larger population of girls and young women to enter into engineering.  <br/> <br/>Specifically, this project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas and the Society for Women Engineers that follows a purposive sample of high school girls participating in SWENext, an organization dedicated to identifying and supporting young women interested in engineering. This study will employ a mixed-methods approach; the quantitative component will follow a sample of approximately 700-900 girls over a period of three years (as they transition from high school into college) via online surveys, while a qualitative component will similarly follow a longitudinal sample of 30 girls over time with in-depth interviews. This project will address several aims that will extend the research on inequality in engineering and STEM fields in important ways. First, the study will examine the gender identity of SWENext members, to shed light on how these young women view their own gender and make sense of prevailing gender norms and roles. Second, it will examine whether and how peers and adults provide support and encouragement for SWENext members' interest in engineering, recognizing the array of peers (e.g. friends, classmates, extra-curricular participants, and online peers) and adults (e.g. parents and teachers) that girls interact with, and considering the potential for conflicting messages, as some are likely supportive of girls' non-normative interests at the same time that others negatively sanction such interests. Further, the research team will examine whether support is more available or impactful when it comes from same-gender sources. The final aim of the study is to examine how these factors help shape girls' decision to declare an engineering major in college, as well as their engineering-related self-efficacy and identity. In addressing these three broad aims, the research team employs an intersectional lens to examine how girls' views, experiences, and outcomes differ by racial/ethnic background. Results of the project will be widely disseminated to academic research audiences, as well as educational practitioners and stakeholders in engineering and industry who share the goal of increasing the representation of females in engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the traditional products of an RET Site, which include classroom activities and techniques linked to cutting edge research that can be taken to the K-12 clasroom, this RET will also inform the body of knowledge concerning partnerships between K-12 schools and universities.  The project research will enumerate the types and depth of effects on each of the six different constituents of the teams: K-12 teachers, pre-service teachers, community college faculty, undergraduate engineering students, graduate students in engineering and university faculty.  <br/><br/>The project is a collaborative effort between NCSU College of Engineering and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC). It will target a total of 36 in-service teachers from Durham and Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Public Schools and pre-service teachers from the Colleges of Education at NCSU and UNCC over three years. A team consisting of a K-12 teacher, a community college STEM faculty member, a pre-service teacher and an engineering undergraduate student will participate in an intensive six week summer research experience in the laboratory of a partnering engineering faculty member. Research topics will be focused on one of four sub areas of the Grand Challenges of Engineering: sustainability (solar energy), health (biomechanics), security (computer network security), and joy of living (aerospace engineering). Local industry will serve as both partners and participants in the program. The goals of the Site are to: 1) Create positive benefits for each participant (increased STEM efficacy for teachers, improved classroom technique for both teachers and faculty, increased engineering efficacy for undergraduate engineering students and enhanced retention); 2) Research the impact of participation in the RET on each participant as they return to their native environment; and 3) Discover elements of stratified team design that are most efficacious in meeting the above goals to inform the design of future RET programs."

The symposium brings together various NSF-funded broadening participation projects (such as NSF INCLUDES Pilots and NSF ADVANCE projects), Hispanic-Serving Institutions, as well as national professional organizations that have a focus on enhancing the participation, inclusion and success of Latinas (and other traditionally underrepresented minority groups) in STEM careers. Therefore, the symposium provides a platform for the sharing of ideas, strategies, and best practices to broaden the participation, inclusion, and success of Latinas in academic STEM careers. This work is important for society because if Latinas continue to be underrepresented, and hence underutilized in the STEM workforce, the U.S. will likely lose ground in terms of its scientific and other workforce competitive advantages. Increasing Latina representation among STEM faculty also provides the needed role models for Latina/o students to enter into STEM careers, transition to graduate programs and ultimately progress to the professoriate. Moreover, diversifying the STEM professoriate promotes innovation and creativity, and expands the range of perspectives and experiences to which students in STEM fields are exposed. Therefore, it serves to offset preconceived notions and stereotypes some students might have about women and underrepresented ethnic minority populations. <br/><br/>The NSF INCLUDES Symposium advances the knowledge and understanding of how work-life issues, policies/practices, mentoring, and climate surrounding equity and inclusiveness affect the recruitment, retention, and advancement, including into leadership positions, of Latinas in STEM academic careers. The symposium incorporates presentations by scholars engaged in emerging research on Latinas (including intersectionality issues), individual perspectives from STEM Latina faculty/professionals as well as perspectives from institutions of higher education (especially Hispanic-Serving Institutions) and national diversity-serving professional organizations such as the Latina Researchers Network. It also highlights the lessons learned from other NSF-funded broadening participation projects such as NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilots and NSF ADVANCE projects. These types of interactions/discussions allow for the development of shared goals, common metrics, and mutually reinforcing activities that lead to forming new collaborations and the expansion of the NSF INCLUDES National Network. The lessons learned from the symposium, including all presentations and panel discussions, are to be compiled and published in an edited volume, and disseminated to serve as a resource for the broader STEM community and academia at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to transform the offerings of a traditional engineering department with a new curriculum model that emphasizes design and innovation approaches, offering students a variety of pathways to a degree in a program with disciplinary depth and a range of learning experiences. This adaptive kind of engineering professional is in demand by creative industries that are committed to blending science, engineering, arts, and design to address the world's problems. The department's current curriculum is composed mostly of traditional engineering courses that are lecture and exam-heavy, with little opportunity for experiential learning or open-ended design. A combination of approaches will be developed that includes providing multiple paths through the curriculum for students, giving them the freedom to choose a variety of concentrations - from biomedical applications to digital arts - and providing outreach opportunities for K-12 students in underserved and underrepresented populations. These innovations will allow the department to attract a broader pool of students and prepare them for a wide variety of careers. These improvements not only broaden the diversity of students entering the program, they expand students' academic experiences and design and innovation skills. Applying this concept to an entire department curriculum will allow for the creation of a sustainable and scalable participatory curriculum that can be replicated by other programs. This project will also spur new connections with industry leaders, enhancing students' academic experiences while providing regional economic benefits.<br/><br/>The vision of this project is to transform Virginia Tech's Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from a department with narrow curricular paths that attracts and produces a limited range of traditional engineers to one that draws and retains a wider pool of students and prepares them to be holistic professionals for a broader range of careers. To implement this vision the project will create and implement a reproducible process of curriculum transformation that dramatically enhances the emphasis on design and innovation. By combining threshold concepts theory and design-based learning, a department with just two highly determined paths - electrical engineering and computer engineering - becomes one overarching program. The multiple curricular pathways will be anchored in real world problems, forging new connections to K-12 education and to 21st century industries, including start-ups, design consultancies, and non-governmental organizations. This re-design process - broadening the pool of students entering the department while increasing potential career opportunities - is learner-centered, stakeholder-informed, and features assessment and evaluation efforts that can be used to continuously improve education in support of holistic professional development, ensuring it is sustainable and replicable within the time and resource constraints faced by any major engineering department."

Identity refers to how people see themselves, or the ""kind of person"" that they identify with. Logically speaking, if individuals strongly identify themselves with a particular field, they are more likely to pursue and remain in that field. Yet there is limited research testing this idea, particularly in engineering. This project is surveying thousands of students in engineering programs at a variety of different high schools and colleges to build an evidence base. The results are being used to understand how engineering identity and early engineering experiences predict persistence to graduation and persistence in the profession. This information is being used to better design and evaluate the impact of early engineering outreach and interventions. The variety of schools and students in this study is enabling examination of differences by gender and ethnicity, which is informing interventions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. The results are being disseminated widely to teachers, professors, administrators and others so that they can use the results to improve programs for engineering student recruitment and retention. <br/><br/>The investigators are employing survey scale development and multivariate regression modeling to examine the predictors of engineering identity and its impact on persistence at different educational stages. Identity is emerging as an attractive explanation for who persists in engineering, yet few studies have directly linked identity to persistence, nor thoroughly examined the host of factors that shape identity. This project is building on work on math and science identity, as well as research on the importance of professional experiences, to examine these issues. The study is unique in its examination of engineering identity across a range of educational stages, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and recent bachelor's-level engineering graduates. Through ongoing longitudinal work and a cross-sectional design using multivariate regression, this study is describing engineering identity trajectories from high school through graduate study or professional employment. Study sites include 100 high schools enrolling approximately 5000 students per year in engineering courses and engineering departments of mechanical, civil and biomedical engineering at five institutions enrolling a total of 5000 undergraduate and 2000 graduate engineering students.

Therefore, we need intentional ways to connect cutting-edge scientific research on learning and pedagogy to teaching practice. To bridge this gap in the research-practice cycle, we propose the Rising Engineering Education Faculty Experience (REEFE), a semester long, immersive program for future engineering education professionals (graduate students).  The benefits of the program are two-fold in that it provides graduate students in engineering education research the opportunity to apply their skills in a practical setting and develop collaborations and professional identity while also exposing experienced education practitioners to the benefits of engineering education research. During each semester, a graduate student (currently enrolled in an engineering education PhD program) works with faculty members at a host institution on selected projects or problems identified at the school. Host institutions have high levels of practical engineering education experience, but limited engineering education research experience. Through this program, graduate students learn how to apply their knowledge of educational theory, assessment, research methods, and skills at being a change agent while gaining practical knowledge about teaching engineering from experienced engineering educators. In exchange, faculty members at the host institution collaborate with engineering education research experts (late-stage graduate students) and discover how research can benefit their teaching and classrooms.<br/><br/>This EAGER project will support an extended pilot program ultimately leading to the development of a full, sustainable model for a larger Rising Engineering Education Faculty Experience Consortium. In this pilot program, graduate students will be recruited from Virginia Tech and Purdue's Engineering Education programs and collaborate with faculty at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Two prior tests of the program produced positive collaborations between researchers and practitioners and evidence of participants' professional development. These results, expressions of interest from peer schools, and affirmations from independent stakeholders indicated a need to explore a larger, sustainable consortium model. This program focuses on integrating future engineering education experts (engineering education graduate students) into traditional engineering programs in order to provide support for implementing and sustaining educational interventions developed by researchers. By infusing late-stage graduate students into traditional engineering departments, this program seeks to broaden the engineering community's understanding of the benefits to and ability to incorporate and sustain research-based practices into courses and departments. Overall, the Consortium will facilitate the following activities: 1) recruit and match engineering education graduate students to partner institutions where they will work closely with engineering faculty on engineering education research activities, 2) provide developmental coaching for graduate students and faculty before, during, and after the program experience, and 3) conduct research on the impact to the research-practice cycle. Through these efforts, we seek to positively impact engineering education practices and graduate student development."

This study draws from previous research in disciplinary literacy instruction, a promising teaching approach that has led to positive outcomes among underrepresented students in disciplines such as history and science. Under a model of disciplinary literacy instruction in engineering, students learn to read and write like an engineer through guided practice in evaluating and creating authentic texts in the service of engineering design activity. The purpose of this foundational research is to advance knowledge by developing a robust model of disciplinary literacy in engineering. To achieve this goal, the study will identify the common literacy practices used by engineers from four different sub-disciplines (aerospace/mechanical, biological, civil/environmental, and electrical/computer) who each work at different engineering companies. This study will describe the ways in which these engineers use shared frameworks to evaluate and create texts. This study will use these findings to develop a model of disciplinary literacy and curricular materials for use in K-16 classrooms. The exploration will establish the foundation for a trajectory of future research that will ultimately test the model of disciplinary literacy in engineering in diverse K-16 classrooms.<br/><br/>Although disciplinary literacy instruction has been shown to produce positive outcomes for underrepresented students in several academic disciplines, empirically-based models of disciplinary literacy instruction have not been developed and tested in the discipline of engineering. The purpose of this early stage design and development research is to advance knowledge by developing a robust model of disciplinary literacy in engineering that can be tested in diverse K-16 classrooms. A multiple, comparative case study will describe how eight engineers from varied companies and sub-disciplines (aerospace/mechanical, biological, civil/environmental, and electrical/computer) use literacy practices to solve problems through engineering. A constant comparative analysis of think-alouds, observations, and interviews with each engineer will result in the identification of common cognitive frameworks that engineers use while they interpret and generate core texts. These findings will be translated into a model of disciplinary literacy in engineering, with accompanying leveled classroom materials, designed to support K-16 students in thinking like an engineer as they read and write authentic genres in the service of engineering design activity. This instructional approach is expected to broaden participation by providing underrepresented students with literacy instruction designed to support their engagement with engineering. Future studies will test whether disciplinary literacy instruction leads to positive outcomes, such as an improved ability to engage in complex engineering design processes, among underrepresented K-16 students."

Fabricating patterns with sizes less than 10 nanometers (10 billionths of a meter, or about 10,000 times smaller than a human hair) is essential for the manufacturing of future integrated circuits with speeds and functionality far exceeding current capabilities, that could revolutionize computers, information storage, and clean energy devices. Biological applications such as rapid DNA sequencing also require such small dimensions. Although techniques have demonstrated this resolution, their integration into manufacturing is hampered by serious technical and/or economic issues. Previously, the researchers demonstrated a nanopantography method that could address these issues. In this process, patterns are formed on a substrate such as a silicon wafer by directing a beam of positive ions at the substrate. Ions are focused to write patterns at sizes as small as 3 nanometers simultaneously at billions of locations. The past research was limited by the fact that the focusing structure (an array of lenses that focus ions much as glass lenses focus light) had to be incorporated on the substrate, which resulted in low throughput. The new studies will solve this problem by allowing the lens array to be separate, so that it can be used on multiple substrates. This will enable many applications for advanced electronic devices that benefit all aspects of modern life, especially the energy and health industries, with clear societal benefits. This challenging project will lead to new knowledge and will advance education in this important area of science and technology.<br/><br/>The electrostatic microlenses were built on the substrate, using standard microelectronic manufacturing methods. Voltages applied to the lens array cause ion beamlets entering each of billions of microlenses to be focused on the substrate. Using nanopantography, arrays of 300 nm diameter electrostatic lenses create nano-patterns in Si with sizes as small as 3 nm. While nanopantography can form complex patterns with very high resolution, the technique relies on the fabrication of a microlens array on each substrate, adding complexity to the process. To address this issue, the PIs plan on separating the microlens array from the substrate, so that it can be reused for patterning of subsequent substrates. This involves the fabrication of a stencil mask, containing the microlens array, which will be placed on sequential substrates to demonstrate a print-and-repeat process. Following this approach will greatly improve throughput, making nanopantography a manufacturing-worthy process. Experimental work will be complemented by ion trajectory simulations to achieve best focus, as a function of gap between the stencil mask and the substrate, and plasma beam conditions. Molecular Dynamics simulations will be used to study nanofeature etching in graphene on SiO2 by O+ and O2+, with an emphasis on the effect of ion energy and mass on feature size. Quality control measures will be demonstrated for potential pilot line manufacturing. The work will demonstrate a massively parallel method to repeatedly write nanopatterns in 2-D materials (graphene and WS2) on a substrate with a better than the state-of-the-art resolution of 3 nm, using a reusable stencil mask lens array.  Nano holes, dots, and ribbons formed in the 2D layers will be characterized for plasmonic and other optoelectronic properties. Nanodisks will be carved out of large area WS2 films. Micro-photoluminescence will be used to characterize their light emitting properties."

S. governmental agencies that are working to diversify the engineering workforce throughout the country.<br/><br/>Comprising quantitative and qualitative research methods,investigators from Bowie State University and Morgan State University outlined a comprehensive exploratory, mixed-method study that aims to pinpoint the different factors that shape Black middle school-aged students' interest in engineering and determine what specific experiences actually influence their understanding of engineering and other STEM-related fields. It is quite likely that the research findings will offer important insights on middle school-aged, Black males and how engineering and other STEM-related programs and experiences can influence their academic interests and career aspirations. Further, secondary and postsecondary professionals will be able to use the project findings to improve formal and informal engineering and other STEM-related learning experiences for Black middle school-aged students."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>The sense of hearing is a critically important ability that enables an individual to relate to the external world.  Loss of hearing affects an individual?s health, function, quality of life and mortality.  Current estimates are that hearing loss results in excess medical costs ranging from $3.3 to $12.8B in the United States, and over $750B worldwide.  A recent report from the National Academies highlighted the need to recognize hearing loss as a major public health concern.  This planning grant brings together a diverse team of researchers from Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Southern California and Oregon Health Science University. This team will have complementary expertise in auditory neuroscience, cochlear implants, speech perception and devices that connect directly to neurons.  This team will engage in a series of meeting and activities that will lay the foundation for an Engineering Research Center in Auditory Bioengineering. The proposed Center will work to develop new technologies, expand the engineering workforce and foster a culture of diversity and inclusion by supporting the deaf and hard of hearing, especially members of underserved populations. At the scientific level, the engineering advances in technologies for precise electrical stimulation of neurons will be broadly applicable to devices such as retinal implants, auditory implants and deep brain stimulators.<br/>  <br/>Recognizing the limitations of hearing aids and cochlear implants, the planning team will seek to revolutionize current hearing rehabilitative technology through transformative engineering enabled by a convergent approach involving several engineering disciplines.  The major scientific goal will be to develop a next generation auditory implant that more intimately connects to spiral ganglion cells, more faithfully encodes sound, is smaller and easier to use, and is more economical.  During the course of this grant, the planning team will critically evaluate the potential of recent technological advances to improve hearing health care and identify additional participants to perform center-scale research.   This will be accomplished through a series of meetings held in in Houston, TX, Los Angeles, CA and Portland, OR.   The team will engage stakeholders - including individuals with cochlear implants, hearing health care professionals, policy makers in hearing health care, and low-income individuals whose hearing health care needs are currently unmet.  The team will used evidence-based strategies to recruit and develop the center leadership team.   The team will also engage major cochlear implant manufacturers and identify other industrial partners.<br/>The intellectual focus of this proposal will reside in a critical evaluation of the potential for the following thrust areas to serve as a foundation for convergent research in Auditory Bioengineering.  Thrust 1: Enabling Technologies for Next Generation Auditory Implants.   In this thrust, recent advances in engineering technologies such as carbon nanofiber electrodes for neural interfacing will be integrated into biomedical microsystems to produce an innovative design for a next generation auditory implant.  Thrust 2: Speech Perception for Auditory Bioengineering.  In this thrust, recent advances the cognitive aspects of speech perception will be harnessed to determine the relevant information that needs to be passed to auditory implants and how best to provide that information based on what is known about the neural code, with consideration that different languages are tuned to different acoustic features.  Thrust 3: Global Health and Disparities Research in Auditory Rehabilitation.  This thrust will seek to investigate and evaluate ways to expand access to auditory rehabilitation with hearing aids and cochlear implants, especially for underserved population.<br/>The goal will be to develop an ERC in Auditory Bioengineering that will serve a national resource for auditory researchers, neuroengineers, audiologists and clinicians.  With a central location in Houston, TX, the center will have national outreach and serve as a way to pool patient populations for studies on outcomes and disparities in auditory rehabilitation.  This proposal will fill a key need in workforce development in training more students at the interface of hearing and speech research, who are prepared to employ modern engineering approaches for auditory rehabilitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, we need intentional ways to connect cutting-edge scientific research on learning and pedagogy to teaching practice. To bridge this gap in the research-practice cycle, we propose the Rising Engineering Education Faculty Experience (REEFE), a semester long, immersive program for future engineering education professionals (graduate students).  The benefits of the program are two-fold in that it provides graduate students in engineering education research the opportunity to apply their skills in a practical setting and develop collaborations and professional identity while also exposing experienced education practitioners to the benefits of engineering education research. During each semester, a graduate student (currently enrolled in an engineering education PhD program) works with faculty members at a host institution on selected projects or problems identified at the school. Host institutions have high levels of practical engineering education experience, but limited engineering education research experience. Through this program, graduate students learn how to apply their knowledge of educational theory, assessment, research methods, and skills at being a change agent while gaining practical knowledge about teaching engineering from experienced engineering educators. In exchange, faculty members at the host institution collaborate with engineering education research experts (late-stage graduate students) and discover how research can benefit their teaching and classrooms.<br/><br/>This EAGER project will support an extended pilot program ultimately leading to the development of a full, sustainable model for a larger Rising Engineering Education Faculty Experience Consortium. In this pilot program, graduate students will be recruited from Virginia Tech and Purdue's Engineering Education programs and collaborate with faculty at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Two prior tests of the program produced positive collaborations between researchers and practitioners and evidence of participants' professional development. These results, expressions of interest from peer schools, and affirmations from independent stakeholders indicated a need to explore a larger, sustainable consortium model. This program focuses on integrating future engineering education experts (engineering education graduate students) into traditional engineering programs in order to provide support for implementing and sustaining educational interventions developed by researchers. By infusing late-stage graduate students into traditional engineering departments, this program seeks to broaden the engineering community's understanding of the benefits to and ability to incorporate and sustain research-based practices into courses and departments. Overall, the Consortium will facilitate the following activities: 1) recruit and match engineering education graduate students to partner institutions where they will work closely with engineering faculty on engineering education research activities, 2) provide developmental coaching for graduate students and faculty before, during, and after the program experience, and 3) conduct research on the impact to the research-practice cycle. Through these efforts, we seek to positively impact engineering education practices and graduate student development."

The purpose of this early-concept project is to explore the development of an engineering education specific community to support early career faculty in engineering education. This project focuses on the National Science Foundation's CAREER award as a particular indicator of early success in engineering education. Using an untested approach to infrastructure development for early engineering education researchers, the project applies theories from organizational change literature in order to equitably provide CAREER application resources and support to early career engineering education researchers throughout the United States.<br/><br/>Using collaborative inquiry, we will build a base of existing CAREER awardees and explore particular advice, resources, and trends that would be important to consider and include in developing an early CAREER mentor network. This first phase will generate engineering education specific (as opposed to general CAREER application advice that many universities provide) resources that can be contributed to a change network. The second, and most intensive phase of this project, focuses on extending the current network to provide these EER specific resources equitable to early career engineering education faculty.<br/><br/>This effort addresses the concerns around differential faculty support within different types of appointments and provides leadership development to support engineering education faculty's movement into core positions with the community. This work provides support and resources for faculty who are often ""lone wolves"" or otherwise unsupported in engineering education researchers at their institutions. These individuals play an important role in the engineering education research community and equitable access to resources for CAREER application development provides not only strong development for researchers at engineering departments and centers but also to those who connect into more traditional engineering spaces. By expanding who has access to engineering education research resources and support, we can diversify and improve the quality of CAREER applications.

Nanotechnology is widely recognized on a global scale as one of the 21st century's most influential and transformative technologies and is by its nature multidisciplinary, drawing from physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and essentially all areas of engineering.  Hence the skills and knowledge necessary to properly prepare the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and engineers require educational models which build a cross-disciplinary vocabulary and theoretical framework, and which help to develop a multidisciplinary learning community.  Further, critical shortages are being predicted in developing a nanotechnology workforce-not just at the PhD/research level, but also amongst those who will need to manufacture, apply, and use nanotechnology in a variety of areas.   Training undergraduates in the multidisciplinary area of nanotechnology will prepare our next generation of graduate researchers as well as those who will participate in industrial research and manufacturing. This renewal program has already proven to be successful in providing research experiences, mentorship, professional development and a supportive learning environment for more than 60 undergraduates, almost all of whom have continued on to advanced study and success in helping to develop the field of nanotechnology and support its use in critical applications such as in health care and medical research, developing new sustainable energy sources and efficient storage technologies, and in environmental stewardship and reducing environmental pollutants.  The program has also had great success in enhancing diversity in the nanotechnology research and industrial communities, as over half of the participants have been women and nearly a third from minority populations underrepresented in STEM.  As the field of nanotechnology and it uses continues to evolve, supporting growth in economies and providing new solutions for emerging societal and global needs, this program will continue to respond to the experiential education needs of undergraduates from diverse institutions and backgrounds.<br/><br/>Over a three year period SUNY Stony Brook will offer an intense ten week summer research program to eight interns. The multidisciplinary nanotechnology program will involve four engineering departments and be administered by the University's Center for Inclusive Education (CIE).  Providing real research experiences for undergraduates tailored to each student's interests under the guidance of a faculty mentor, is a critical need for the successful education of the next generation of engineers and scientists.  The laboratories involved will provide research experiences for REU interns in all aspects of nanotechnology and nanomaterials development, including polymeric nanostructures for medical applications, batteries, catalytic surfaces for energy and environmental remediation, and development of nanosensors. The program's approach integrates a comprehensive graduate education preparation model that has proven to be effective in successful transition of undergraduate students into competitive graduate programs.  The project will also include a RET experience for a STEM high school teacher. Results of this program will be widely disseminated to the campus and local community, and to other scientists and engineers in the U.S. and worldwide."

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.<br/><br/>A two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment.

At the same time, early reports indicate that many maker and hacker spaces are already enacting certain norms that are more conducive to participation of white, male, middle-class, able-bodied hobbyists. Despite this trend, there are spaces that explicitly stand out in their inclusion of homeless makers, women, people of color, and people with different kinds of abilities. This project examines how diverse maker spaces welcome groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM, and how these practices can inform the design and operation of campus and community maker or hacker spaces that presently struggle to achieve diversity. <br/><br/>Ethnographic methods and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) are used to understand these spaces in terms of their physical and linguistic artifacts.  This Participatory Action Research (PAR) includes ethnographies at 6 to 8 inclusive maker and hacker spaces, an Open Space Technology (OST) workshop focused on identifying and analyzing core attributes of transferable inclusive practices, and CDA that reflexively summarizes and propagates this information in applicable ways to academic and community sites. Research questions include:  (1) What practices and artifacts do participants in diverse maker and hacker spaces employ to establish and maintain environments that are diverse and inclusive? (2) What does the discourse in diverse maker and hacker spaces reveal about how meaning and value are co-constructed around identity, creativity, and the culture of production / the production of culture in engineering? (3) What best practices emerge from diverse maker and hacker spaces, and how can these translate to design or transformation of existing maker spaces on campuses and in communities? Intellectual Merit: This work is early in its use of CDA, the Highlander strain of PAR, and OST, all novel in engineering education; and early in seeking to characterize features contributing to the liberatory nature of emergent diverse maker spaces. The work is interdisciplinary and potentially transformative in leveraging linguistic analysis and social theories to ferret out root causes of exclusionary STEM practices for the potential high payoff of building campus and community maker spaces (and other STEM spaces) that are inclusive. Broader Impacts: This project co-constructs ways to stimulate innovative design thinking in experiential curricula; increases retention and broadens participation in STEM by embedding inclusive practices; empowers citizen engineers through local and national networks of makers, students, and faculty; and enables new ways of STEM learning and design thinking that will enrich the U.S. innovation ecosystem through progressive learning environments for undergraduate engineers. Findings are propagated non-tradtionally via maker virtual communities, maker faires, and informal networks, in addition to traditional propagation through the STEM education literature and the network of 150 engineering deans and other academic leaders committed to making on campus."

However, little is understood about how UREs affect students' views of research, their identities as researchers, and their beliefs about knowledge in engineering. Investigating students' researcher identities and beliefs about knowledge (epistemic beliefs) in the context of URE is important because they shape the students' perceptions, values, and interactions with others, which can then be translated to their classes and future careers. The outcomes of this study help develop meaningful ways for students to engage, function, and learn in research spaces as well as classrooms and laboratories. Findings also expand theories about identity and epistemic beliefs in ways that are specific to engineering fields. The goal of the project is to address the challenge of producing engineers who are well-equipped to tackle complex, ill-defined, and open-ended problems similar to those encountered when doing research. The results enable engineering educators to provide novel educational experiences, developing students as future researchers and engineers such that these experiences will have long term impacts. The project's broader impacts include benefits to fields beyond engineering that engage students in research. Also, by including diverse student populations in the study, a deeper understanding is gained about how students from different backgrounds, engineering fields, and types of institutions experience and benefit from participating in research.<br/><br/>The overarching research question for this project is: How do undergraduate engineering students develop their identities as researchers and their ways of knowing engineering through research experiences?  There are four specific aims of this project. The first is to understand how undergraduate engineering students conceptualize and construct what it means to be a researcher. The second is to discover what factors the students think affect their researcher identity development. The third is to find out how these students describe what it means to know something in their fields. The fourth is to understand how students form their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing during research experiences. A grounded theory approach is used to expand existing identity and epistemic belief frameworks to develop a theory within the context of research experiences in engineering. The three-phase study uses open-ended surveys and interviews to identify themes that answer the research aims and can be used to develop workshops. The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing an engineering-specific learning theory based on students' beliefs about ways of knowing and their identities as researchers. This theory is used to inform and work with engineering educators to find ways to apply research findings in engineering degree programs and UREs.  Workshops for engineering educators focus on ways to incorporate the aspects of UREs that help build students' ways of knowing and their identities as participants in their research communities and their engineering fields."

As the world explores alternatives to fossil fuels, marine renewable resources have received increased interest due to their environmentally friendly power production potential. These energy sources are abundant in a variety of forms: ocean waves driven by winds, tides influenced by celestial/lunar forces, various gradients (like temperature and salinity), and open ocean currents.  Ocean currents off the Southeast U.S. represent an untapped energy source with a technically feasible power production potential estimated at 19 GW in U.S. waters. The proposed project will utilize undergraduate research to address three areas important to the commercial scale installation of ocean current energy extraction devices: 1) resource assessment, 2) system design and reliability, and 3) environmental interactions. More than many other STEM fields, ocean renewable energy research offers undergraduate research a global, big picture perspective that encompasses coastal energy and environmental considerations.  Undergraduates trained in this REU Site will understand how their projects impact the emerging ocean current based electricity production both in the U.S. and around the world.    <br/><br/>FAU will host 10 undergraduate students for a 10 week summer program which will utilize an undergraduate research training approach that includes 1) engagement in a world-class ocean science and engineering research community; 2) participation in professional development training that prepares students for research-related career paths; 3)detailing the application that their research projects support (Ocean Current Energy); and 4) development of expertise in both lab-based computational and experimental engineering methodologies that leads to original research."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Over 300 Billion dollars in damages were incurred in 2017 due to extreme weather in the U.S., a new record in terms of both direct and indirect losses. In addition to losses from weather-related events, extreme geologic and human-caused disasters can cause staggering financial burdens to the economy. The need for understanding what makes communities resilient whereby they can adapt and recover quickly from these events is fundamental to the survival of the nation. We propose that a key to understanding how to effectively and efficiently recovery from these extreme events is to examine natural systems that inherently resist, adapt, and evolve to ever-evolving stressors. Ecological resilience examines the ability of a natural system to respond to disturbances and measures the system's ability to return to a functioning state. While humans seek resiliency and sustainability through simplification and order, the diversity and complexity of natural systems is what makes them resilient & sustainable. Therefore, understanding the attributes that make a system resilient requires an understanding of both the individual components of the system and the interdependencies of these components. The uniqueness of this potential Engineering Research Center (ERC) is our hypothesis in that it is not the study of individual organisms that is the key to resilience, but the study of the systems that these organisms inhabit and enable. Nature has provided an avenue for developing analysis methods, models and systems that provide resilience to extreme events and conditions. The mission of this planning grant is to develop the team and structure of transdisciplinary research that examines the attributes of resilient natural systems, create collaborations between innovative researchers, and construct an infrastructure that allows for collaborative research leading to economic development through tech transfer. A successful grant would provide research leading to substantially improved national defense facilities and networks, the next generation of resilient and efficient infrastructure, and adaptable community planning. The knowledge gained would inform community leaders, planners, engineers and the public on mitigating the impact of and recovering from extreme events. <br/><br/>The integration of knowledge, disciplines and methods that span science and engineering required to provide comprehensive approaches to infrastructure and community resilience is found in natural systems. By considering multi-scale research from the organism to system levels, we anticipate dramatic increases to the state of the art in a) adaptable, sustainable and efficient materials and forms for use in infrastructure, b) leveraging the interdependencies in systems to improve human community resilience, c) developing algorithms for optimization, integration and adaptability of built infrastructure based on natural processes, and d) improved pedagogical approaches for development of innovative designers and community leaders. This planning grant will take a novel approach to developing transdisciplinary research teams that embrace both creativity and diversity, and that provide mechanisms for inclusion across institutional classifications.  The model for the center will itself model natural systems by recognizing that interdependencies between researchers are as important as the expertise of the individual researchers. The research team recognizes that not all ERC planning grants will lead to successfully funded ERCs. However, the planning process will still provide significant broader impacts including development of 1) Multi-scale, transdisciplinary teams to appropriately tackle biomimicry for resilient and sustainable structures 2) Industrial partnerships for tech transfer, innovation and economic development in the area of biomimicry 3) Organizational structures that promote shared resources, engaged teaming and broad diversity, 4) An identified network of researchers capable of creative synthesis across disciplinary boundaries and 5) Recognition of diverse teaming beyond the limits of ""visually identifiable"" demographic diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peer review is a key site of social construction of knowledge and micropolitics of knowledge production. It serves as a gateway for new knowledge to become part of a field. As an emerging and interdisciplinary field, engineering education research presents a valuable, and timely, opportunity to learn about processes of disciplinary development, and to better understand the micropolitics of peer review in an emerging and interdisciplinary field. Moreover, in engineering education research, the boundaries of the field can have implications for insights that ultimately influence engineering education practices. As a relatively new field, it has been noted that engineering education research remains underdeveloped in some regards, including inclusion of theoretical and methodological approaches from social science fields. However, little research has been done to identify how the boundaries of the field are established and maintained. This study is the first investigation of a large group of engineering education researchers' peer review experiences and editors' perspectives. <br/>  <br/>The research objective of this project is to identify research normativities and values shaping the emerging field of engineering education research through the peer review processes. The intervention objective of this project is to develop and implement materials targeted to engineering education researchers so that they better understand their field and how it can be advanced in new directions. In-depth qualitative interviews are being conducted with 40 authors and at least 5 editors of the Journal of Engineering Education. Authors include those who have had articles published and those who have had articles rejected, as well as those who fall into both categories. The interviews explore participants' peer review experiences and beliefs about the field's boundaries. Emergent patterns in experiences and beliefs will be used to identify theoretical, methodological, epistemological, and topical normativities that shape the field. These patterns provide new insights into engineering education research, specifically, its dominant values, boundaries, and levels of interdisciplinarity, thus also providing new insights into the social construction of knowledge in an emerging, interdisciplinary field. Based on findings from the interviews, stakeholder-specific workshops are being conducted for different groups: current and future engineering education researchers.

They are lightweight, have close to bones physical and mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility and osseointegration, and they can completely degrade and be replaced by naturally re-grown bones. However, installation of bare Mg-based implants has frequently been accompanied with high initial corrosion rate and hydrogen release burst that can cause variety of post-surgical complications. Therefore, the success of their implementation highly depends on control of corrosion rate and hydrogen release especially during the initial stage of installation. This function can be provided by special coatings having well-controlled water permeability. <br/><br/>This project supports exploratory work on an untested, but potentially transformative idea for biodegradable Mg implants. It is exploring a new process methodology and underlying mechanism in a new ""thin film coatings concept for tunable water transport"" - through coating components that are capable of providing targeted/tunable resorption or degradation time. It will study how combining thin, degradable and nanoporous layers into nanolaminate coatings can significantly extend tunable control of initial corrosion rate of Mg-based implants. This project also supports providing URM students at an HBCU with state-of-the-art science and technology training, along with deeper exposure to team-based research and value-creation best practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.<br/><br/>A two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal leverages STEM programs developed through prior RET site and NSF Engineering Research Center awards that have resulted in a strong partnership with Houston Independent School District (HISD), which has a very diverse student population. The Rice RET is designed to not only develop content and leadership skills but also scale up research experiences by forming a nexus of teacher leaders who can then train new teachers in perpetuity. Teacher interns will work with curriculum specialists to develop lessons that are inquiry-based, embedded with nanoscience and engineering, and tightly aligned with National and Texas Science standards. The proposed NSF RET Program will enhance and extend the previous successful RET Program.<br/><br/>The Rice Office of STEM Engagement (R-STEM) will offer a K-12 RET program in Nanotechnology with a Focus on Teacher Leadership, an enhancement upon the six years of success Rice University has committed in teacher professional development through research internships. R-STEM will connect STEM teachers who serve students in the Greater Houston metropolitan area with expert faculty in nanoengineering research at Rice. With the help of Rice University's research mentorship and facilities, RET will accomplish the following objectives: 1) use nanoengineering research experiences to enhance teacher content knowledge and understanding of STEM research processes, 2) improve the quality of education though the development of engineering design-based learning activities centered on research practices, 3) create a cadre of teacher leaders, and 4) disseminate the RET outcomes broadly by creating a network of teachers who are actively learning about nanoengineering research and engineering design. Teachers will receive inquiry-based lessons, professional development, and pedagogical support along with leadership training as they translate their research experiences into learning experiences for students. The program will serve as a national model and will broadly disseminate the outcomes of RET via symposiums at Rice, national and state-wide meetings, peer-reviewed publications, and online via the TeachEngineering digital library. Teachers will meet weekly during their RET experience to discuss their research, share their lab experiences, develop lesson ideas, as well as plan the dissemination of their research. Rice postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and industry mentors will be constituents supporting the RET teachers in their research. At the conclusion of the research experience, each teacher will create a research poster to present their experience and finding at the Nanotechnology for Teachers Symposium, to their teaching campus, as well as at district and professional conferences. During the academic school year following their research experiences, teachers will share both their research and lesson plans with other teachers in professional development programs. R-STEM professional development courses will support RET teachers to propagate their knowledge effectively to a large number of STEM teachers, creating a cadre of motivated, creative, and diverse teacher leaders in the community. RET interns will also be encouraged and guided by the R-STEM team to publish their nanotechnology lessons through TeachEngineering.org. Throughout the components of the program, assessment is performed by an external evaluator to determine the impact on the 12 teachers that participate each summer and to provide feedback for refining the program."

Identity refers to how people see themselves, or the ""kind of person"" that they identify with. Logically speaking, if individuals strongly identify themselves with a particular field, they are more likely to pursue and remain in that field. Yet there is limited research testing this idea, particularly in engineering. This project is surveying thousands of students in engineering programs at a variety of different high schools and colleges to build an evidence base. The results are being used to understand how engineering identity and early engineering experiences predict persistence to graduation and persistence in the profession. This information is being used to better design and evaluate the impact of early engineering outreach and interventions. The variety of schools and students in this study is enabling examination of differences by gender and ethnicity, which is informing interventions to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in engineering. The results are being disseminated widely to teachers, professors, administrators and others so that they can use the results to improve programs for engineering student recruitment and retention. <br/><br/>The investigators are employing survey scale development and multivariate regression modeling to examine the predictors of engineering identity and its impact on persistence at different educational stages. Identity is emerging as an attractive explanation for who persists in engineering, yet few studies have directly linked identity to persistence, nor thoroughly examined the host of factors that shape identity. This project is building on work on math and science identity, as well as research on the importance of professional experiences, to examine these issues. The study is unique in its examination of engineering identity across a range of educational stages, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and recent bachelor's-level engineering graduates. Through ongoing longitudinal work and a cross-sectional design using multivariate regression, this study is describing engineering identity trajectories from high school through graduate study or professional employment. Study sites include 100 high schools enrolling approximately 5000 students per year in engineering courses and engineering departments of mechanical, civil and biomedical engineering at five institutions enrolling a total of 5000 undergraduate and 2000 graduate engineering students. The results are providing an understanding of how engineering identity develops and how that identity impacts persistence."

With the shifting demographics of the country, there is also an imperative need to attract women and people from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering to address this workforce shortage. Community colleges are well suited to be a resource in these efforts with the potential to increase both the number and diversity of such qualified engineers. Although community colleges have received much attention in recent years, little is known about the experiences of community college engineering students as they complete their coursework at the community college and transfer to the next stage of their life (e.g., accredited engineering program or their career). As this time period critically influences students' chosen pathways to engineering careers, this study seeks to understand the lived and told experiences of community college engineering students, specifically focusing on those from underrepresented groups (URGs). As this is a budding, diverse pool of talent with promise in meeting the workforce needs, this project has the potential to uncover barriers and catalysts that URGs experience as they progress in their education in multiple contexts. <br/><br/>This project involves diverse community college programs spanning three U.S. Census regions, which could inform both community college programs and four-year institutions across the country. This work also leverages the progress of prior National Science Foundation investments in community colleges while addressing issues of social justice such as inequity and exclusion, which are perpetuated when pathways to Bachelor's degrees are less accessible for particular groups of students - here, community college students. Specifically, the project will address the following research questions: <br/>RQ1: What are the lived and told stories of community college engineering students from URGs? <br/>RQ2: How do URG community college students' understandings of their experiences and the relationship of those experiences to the environment influence their plans for future education and careers? <br/>RQ3: In what ways, if any, do community college engineering students' narratives bring to light issues of oppression, privilege and inequality? <br/><br/>In this narrative inquiry project, the project will conduct a series of in-depth interviews with participants from underrepresented groups at three community college systems in Virginia, Texas, and Arizona, where the selected institutions each serve large numbers of students from underrepresented groups.  These community colleges were chosen intentionally as they have close proximity to and/or articulation agreements with four-year institutions with engineering programs. Gaining a better understanding of student experiences promises to enable proactive development of strategies to position and prepare students to pursue four-year degrees from the inception of their studies at community colleges. Moreover, findings from this study promise to shed light on why existing efforts to increase transfer rates to four-year institutions have had limited effectiveness, which could inform academia, industry, and government."

Understanding the role of community colleges is particularly important, given the large numbers of Black students that enroll in these schools prior to transitioning to four-year engineering programs.  Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that a substantial number of Black engineering students who start their postsecondary careers at community colleges may in fact be first-generation Americans from sub-Saharan African countries.  This study will illuminate factors that are cited by diverse Black engineering prospective and current transfer students from Maryland community colleges as critical to their ability to persist in their majors.  The research team will lead a three-year study of cohorts of Black American and Black African undergraduates who plan to or have already transferred from a Maryland community college to the A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland.  Over the duration of the project, the team will not only query the study participants about what has led to their ability to continue in their majors, but will also reveal differences between the academic paths of students born and educated in the U.S., compared to those who were educated in another country.  In the context of the recent announcement of the Building Together campaign, which afforded the University of Maryland the largest gift in the history of the campus and which includes specific support for engineering transfer students, this project is especially relevant for the Clark School and community colleges in the state.  Furthermore, the project leverages the already strong history that the state of Maryland has with regard to developing support programs and policies for prospective transfer students.  Through this study, the University and state of Maryland will be poised to become national leaders in identifying factors that lead to the production of diverse engineering transfer students.  <br/><br/>This research study builds upon the growing number of studies in engineering education and higher education literature that highlight the centrality of the community college experience to STEM students.  The project also leverages recent works in education and social science scholarship that reveal the importance of documenting within-group differences among students broadly classified as Black or African American.  Collectively, these works reveal noteworthy differences in the K-12 and college/university experiences of students who represent various areas of the African diaspora.  Foregrounded by these studies, the research team in this project will examine factors cited by diverse Black collegians as crucial to their success before, during, and after transfer from a Maryland two-year college to the A.

While the opioid epidemic currently ravaging communities throughout the US has garnered national attention, SUDs are a long-standing challenge, involve a variety of substances, and are expected to be of societal concern for the foreseeable future. In recent years, there has been a marked shift towards a solution-oriented recovery paradigm for addressing SUDs that emphasizes non-clinical alternatives to treatment, early identification of at-risk behavior, post-treatment monitoring and relapse prevention, and sustaining long-term recovery through strengthening community networks. In such a paradigm, engineering approaches can address important gaps in knowledge and build capacity for preventing relapse and maintaining recovery. In this planning grant, George Mason University and our partners seek to conduct the planning activities necessary to create a powerful and impactful Engineering Research Center (ERC) focused on empowering communities of recovery around individuals with SUDs using engineered systems to achieve measurable improvements in long-term health and wellness. The proposed planning activities will engage students from diverse backgrounds, such as neuroscience, psychology, nursing, computer science, electrical engineering and bioengineering to work together using a convergence approach to tackle a significant societal challenge.<br/><br/>The objectives of this ERC planning grant are to: (1) strengthen relationships between academic partners and SUDs stakeholder communities, (2) form a diverse, multidisciplinary ERC team, a high-performing executive leadership team, and a robust, community-engaged governance structure to guide implementation of the ERC programmatic activities across all four foundational elements (Research, Workforce Development, Culture of Inclusion, Innovation Ecosystem) and (3) develop a comprehensive strategic framework, building around a collective vision for supporting technology-empowered communities of recovery. The planning grant team will formulate a number of hypotheses about current barriers and gaps in research knowledge, and engineering approaches that can be used to address these gaps. We will then iteratively update these hypotheses and solutions based on analysis of collected evidence from stakeholders and develop a framing paper. We will organize a strategic planning retreat with key stakeholders to develop a research agenda. Based on the identified research agenda, we will identify an appropriate ERC leadership team and organize a national symposium to refine the motivating vision and critical needs. The anticipated benefits of the planning grant will include a coordination of efforts across different communities, identification of stakeholder needs and priorities with long-, mid- and near-term impact, documentation of best practices and development of a convergent multi-system framework for addressing the underlying challenges using an engineered system approach at multiple scales, from individuals, family and caregivers, and community support networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>By the year 2025, two-thirds of the world's population is expected to live under conditions of water-stress. This has been identified as an enormous global risk, based on the potential impact of this water crisis on society. The National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Center (ERC) program provides national investment in engineering solutions for high-impact societal benefit, and this planning grant will be used bring together scientists, engineers, industry leaders, social scientists, and entrepreneurs to develop the framework for an ERC that will ultimately lead to breakthrough on how water is treated and managed in the United States and beyond. The potential benefits of the project are (1) increased capacity within institutions and the scientific/engineering community to perform impactful and inclusive research on the circular water economy, (2) enhanced understanding of methods to increase diversity and create a culture of inclusion within a research enterprise, (3) strengthened relationships between water-focused researchers and the industrial, non-profit, government, and community partners that can facilitate societal impact, and (4) knowledge among the team of different leadership and management approaches and their benefits and challenges. <br/><br/>The provision of clean water and the development of strategies--technological, economic, and societal--to create a true circular water economy is clearly an area of high-impact societal benefit. For this reason, we have proposed a series of planning activities that will allow us to build capacity and an inclusive culture around the challenge of solving technical water provision and reuse problems while also addressing the global and national health and economic risks of water stress and water reuse. We will work to incorporate the expertise of scientists, engineers, and computational scientists with the perspective of entrepreneurs and social scientists. Central to these activities will be the inclusion of individuals who, by nature of their cultural, racial, gender, or ethnic identification, see problems and solutions differently, and the tight integration with industrial, governmental, and non-governmental partners that are critical to implementing research into a true circular water economy. Through this grant we will share deep subject-matter expertise, co-create novel hypotheses and focal points for future research, identify critical characteristics of an inclusive culture and effective strategies for including diverse researchers, perspectives, and approaches into a large research effort, and identify successful management and leadership strategies for large and diverse groups. These activities will build national capacity to make smart water reuse a reality, as well as facilitate inclusion and better leadership across all those involved with the effort. The plan that develops will be technically grounded, broadly supported by stakeholders, and will incorporate risk aversion, economics, and different corporate and cultural ""frames"" to facilitate high-impact solutions to the problem of water-stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this early-concept project is to explore the development of an engineering education specific community to support early career faculty in engineering education. This project focuses on the National Science Foundation's CAREER award as a particular indicator of early success in engineering education. Using an untested approach to infrastructure development for early engineering education researchers, the project applies theories from organizational change literature in order to equitably provide CAREER application resources and support to early career engineering education researchers throughout the United States.<br/><br/>Using collaborative inquiry, we will build a base of existing CAREER awardees and explore particular advice, resources, and trends that would be important to consider and include in developing an early CAREER mentor network. This first phase will generate engineering education specific (as opposed to general CAREER application advice that many universities provide) resources that can be contributed to a change network. The second, and most intensive phase of this project, focuses on extending the current network to provide these EER specific resources equitable to early career engineering education faculty.<br/><br/>This effort addresses the concerns around differential faculty support within different types of appointments and provides leadership development to support engineering education faculty's movement into core positions with the community. This work provides support and resources for faculty who are often ""lone wolves"" or otherwise unsupported in engineering education researchers at their institutions. These individuals play an important role in the engineering education research community and equitable access to resources for CAREER application development provides not only strong development for researchers at engineering departments and centers but also to those who connect into more traditional engineering spaces. By expanding who has access to engineering education research resources and support, we can diversify and improve the quality of CAREER applications.

For example, a recent American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) study identified a number of student weaknesses, such as: practical experience, project management, problem solving, and design. Equally important, industry supervisors have also identified these gaps. The misalignment between the engineering classroom and workplace poses serious challenges with the professional formation of engineers. Generally speaking, capstone courses are key academic experiences that can bridge these gaps. Few studies, if any, have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses in helping students make the transition from engineering classrooms to the workplace. Instead, most research focuses on course structure, pedagogy, assessment, and end-of-course outcomes. To address the knowledge gaps, the investigators draw on Wenger's concept of communities of practice to study students' experiences as they move from capstone courses to the workplace. <br/><br/>Using a multi-case study design, the project is focusing on four primary research questions: <br/>(a) What skills, practices, and attitudes fostered through the capstone experience do individuals draw on or apply in their early work experiences? <br/>(b) What differences do individuals identify between their capstone design and early work experiences, and how do those differences help or hinder their school-to-work transition?<br/>(c) What specific pedagogical practices or aspects of the capstone course do students identify as helping or hindering their transition?<br/>(d) In what ways do individuals perceive themselves to be underprepared in their early work experiences? <br/><br/>Further, with a particular focus on women and Hispanics, the investigators proposed to study the extent that capstone design courses prepared these students to enter communities of practice in engineering workplaces. This project is closely aligned with the National Science Foundation's strategic priorities to build the STEM workforce with capable individuals, as well as broadening participation in engineering among underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>In the scientific literature, there are numerous studies that highlight the gaps between theory and practice in relation to engineering education and the workplace, yet capstone courses are common practices that engineering instructors use to help students gain more in-depth engineering knowledge. There is a dearth of studies that have examined the effectiveness of capstone courses and how these courses may help students to translate and apply prior engineering coursework to the engineering workplace. With this in mind, this project has immense potential to positively impact engineering instruction across the nation. It also possesses great potential in helping engineering faculty to develop more effective capstone courses, while maximizing their instructional resources to create such courses. Ultimately, this project will benefit U.S. engineering industries seeking to hire adaptable engineering graduates who are technically and professionally prepared to enter the engineering workforce."

In addition to a strong employment outlook for most engineering specialties, engineering careers are constantly being reshaped by rapid technological change, intensified globalization trends, new cross-disciplinary interactions, demographic shifts, and changing organizational structures. In response to these trends, organizations such as ABET, Inc., the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the National Science Foundation (NSF) are leading the charge to improve the alignment of engineering education with the ever-changing demands of professional practice. Yet, despite these reforms, not much is known about the diverse and multi-faceted realities of engineering practice and the ways this knowledge can be used to improve the education and training of engineers across career stages. The workshop supported by this award appraises the current state of research on engineering practice, while working to seed and grow an emerging and vibrant scholarly community that is well positioned to carry out evidence-based transformations of engineering education programs in both academic and industry settings. Participants will include researchers, educators, policymakers, and employers invested in using theory and research on engineering practice to reimagine and transform engineering education and the workforce.<br/><br/>A two-day workshop will bring together a diverse group of approximately 25-30 participants to collaboratively discuss and investigate research on engineering practice. The workshop will be convened immediately prior to, and co-located with, the Frontiers in Education (FIE) Annual Conference in October 2018. Presentations, panels, networking sessions, and group discussions will be used to collectively develop a deeper understanding of engineering practice. Participants will then apply that understanding in interactive sessions focused on using research on engineering practice to transform engineering education and the workforce. The workshop has four main goals. First, a new, global agenda will be defined to inform key stakeholders in decisions about future research on engineering practice. Second, the participants and facilitators will co-create a compendium of literature, topics, sites, partners, methods, and theories that participants and other researchers can draw upon for their own work. Third, the workshop represents a unique opportunity to engage partners from education, policy, and industry in conversation about how research on engineering practice can be used to bring engineering education and professional engineering work into closer alignment. Finally, the workshop will catalyze new research collaborations, projects, and funding proposals related to engineering practice. Workshop activities will incorporate discussions of missing voices and contexts in the literature to identify critical areas for future research that supports broadening participation. Anticipated outcomes include an editorial or position piece on the current state of research on engineering education and actionable guidelines for future research, an edited volume or special issue of a journal comprised of papers or commentaries on engineering education and practice, and a workshop summary report. A special session during the 2018 FIE conference is also planned, to share highlights from the workshop, provide preliminary guidance on methods and approaches for research on engineering practice, and further grow the community of interest among a larger number of potential participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though Texas had a manufacturing output of $232.2B or 15.2% of the gross state product (in 2014), it had only 7.6% of its workforce in manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing development is facing a serious shortage of qualified personnel stemming from a lack of student interest. Many middle/high schools are limited in their growth of technology, robotics, or SkillsUSA programs due to budget constraints and/or lack of technical expertise among teachers. It is necessary to reverse this trend by providing infrastructure and manufacturing expertise to teachers, so that young students are inspired to join engineering and technology programs and choose STEM careers. This site is a direct response to such concerns, generating a motivated workforce well-rooted in manufacturing knowledge/skills, fuse research with education activities at the middle and high schools, motivate students for higher education, and build long-term collaborative partnerships in the region.<br/><br/>Each summer, a group of 12 teachers (a total of 36 teachers over 3-years) will be hosted at TAMU for 6 weeks, where they will immerse in hands-on research experiences in both traditional and advanced manufacturing, specifically in the areas of (i) processes, (ii) materials, and (iii) metrology techniques. The on-site experience will be supplemented with integration and follow-up visits at their respective home institutions, as well as regular status updates. While at TAMU, these teachers will take part in capsulated technical sessions, complementary lab practice, field tours, research seminars, and guided research projects. Deliverables will include an implementation lesson and lab plan, as well as dissemination of the developed curriculum at annual teacher summits. The target school districts are near TAMU, focusing on those in rural areas, or those with a large number of under-represented students. This program is supported by local, state, and national-level industries and professional societies. The expected outcomes of this program will be the transfer of knowledge and skills to excite, empower, and educate students through new class/lab activities. This will enable and inspire students to effectively participate in science/engineering projects and pursue STEM/manufacturing careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Project areas that the students will work on include: 1) Multi-modal cues for phenotypic control of neural cells, 2) Polymer nanoformulations for delivery of macromolecular therapeutics, 3) High Throughput, Automated, Single Cell Electroporation, 4) Encapsulated MSC Regulation of Inflammatory Environments, 5) Cell and tissue engineering approaches to tendon and ligament healing, 6) Reprogrammed Stem Cells and 3-D Microenvironments, 7) High Throughput Platform for Drug Metabolism Screening in Fatty Liver Cells, 8) Interactions of lipid-based nanocarriers with vascular endothelia and macrophages, 9) Designing Scaffold Cues for Retinal Pigment Epithelial Tissue Engineering, 10) Subcellular structural dynamics and mechanotransduction to branching neurons, and 11) Non-destructive measurement of tissue morphomechanical properties. A Cellular Bioengineering Boot Camp introduces participants to laboratory and imaging skills that accelerates their integration into their research labs. A focus on Innovation and Entrepreneurship parallels the recent NSF I-Corps initiative for translational research to capitalize on the potential for new technology that emanates from the research. A component of the program is a clinical immersion, where the REU scholars will observe clinicians in the surgical unit. The Scholars use these experiences to identify needs and problems and brainstorm about innovations and technologies to solve these problems. Under the guidance of faculty from the Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies, the students build business plans around these ideas. Weekly seminars and discussion groups allow tracking and monitoring of the Scholars' experiences while concurrently engaging them in professional development. Incorporation of a mentoring workshop for the graduate students who serve as ""near-peer"" mentors further broadens the impact of the program."

Educating students in these areas requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses motivation and identity as a means to ensure a diverse workforce. The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) at the University of New Mexico plans to revolutionize undergraduate education by launching FACETS: Formation of Accomplished Chemical Engineers for Transforming Society. FACETS will revolutionize CBE by (1) introducing ""CIRE"" design challenges in the core curriculum that are Community-, Industry-, Research-, and/or Entrepreneurship-based; (2) conducting professional development institutes that will train and mentor faculty and graduate students; workshops will be led by experts from industry and national laboratories, from the learning sciences, from engineering education and multicultural studies, for example the directors of UNM Native American Studies and Chicano/a Studies, and (3) create a digital badging system will help students take ownership of their competencies and develop engineering identities and enable faculty to monitor and assess student outcomes and to engage in research on their teaching. The CIRE design challenges, digital badging system and implementation plan will be transferrable to many intermediate to large institutions through the use of a modular approach. Local industry and community partners will participate in presenting the design challenges and encourage entrepreneurial thinking. The use of community engagement through design challenges will engage students in developing their sociotechnical awareness and attract diverse, native and rural populations into engineering.<br/><br/>The field of chemical engineering has evolved over the past century - originating in the petrochemical industries - but now includes electronic materials processing, pharmaceutical production and product design, such as nanoparticles, tissue engineering, nano-medicine, etc. However, the chemical engineering undergraduate core curriculum has not fully reflected this transformation. In order to reposition chemical engineering to educate students prepared for future challenges, the project team will create and study design challenges and digital badges. The project is underlain by a theory of change based on research on engineering education, guided by a broad research question: How can a digital badging system paired with design challenges support students to develop professional identity and an understanding of engineering as an innovative field? The project will result in new understanding of how to engage faculty to support diverse students to be successful in engineering. It will lead to sustained change in the department, including: the ability to prepare diverse engineers ready to solve the challenges of tomorrow; partnerships with industry, national labs and communities; and a model for how to revolutionize undergraduate education."

First-year engineering programs are being scrutinized and reevaluated for the purpose of attracting, retaining, and graduating an increased and diverse new generation of engineers. This research initiation project explores the enculturation of engineering students to the engineering profession during the first-year foundational engineering courses. Engineering enculturation is defined as the process by which a student learns the traditional content of an engineering culture and assimilates engineering practices and values. This work constitutes an analysis of a standard first-year engineering curriculum seen as an enculturation experience. The goal is to identify the extent to which the first-year engineering courses and interventions successfully welcome diverse students to the culture of the engineering profession. As it is the case for other professions with enculturation precedents (i.e. medicine and law), results will provide the foundation from which content, activities and programs can be more attuned to the engineering practice. The impacts of these results include the advancement in the knowledge of the professional formation of engineers through a cycle of theory of acculturation and improvements to the practice of the first-year engineering curriculum. Such impacts are transferable to all engineering years and specializations. <br/><br/>Taking advantage of the enculturation and acculturation advances of the social sciences, enculturation outcome factors have been identified (e.g. algorithmic thinking, problem solving, engineering design, etc.). This research seeks to advance the understanding of these enculturation outcome factors in engineering, approaching them from a diverse population perspective. The guiding research questions of this project are: (a) How do foundational engineering courses facilitate enculturation of first-year engineering students in terms of their performance in engineering enculturation outcome factors? (b) Among the engineering enculturation factors, which are perceived by students to be the easiest and/or the most challenging/difficult to achieve? (c) How do students' perceptions of enculturation to be an engineer change over time? The project takes into consideration subgroup differences in terms of gender, ethnicity, residency (domestic vs. international) and admission type (first time in college). A two year mixed-method research plan is proposed via students' performance scores and focus groups, and the associated results include an Engineering Enculturation Scale (EES) produced by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The ultimate goal is to improve the professional formation of engineers through the lens of cultural acquisition."

The field is often perceived as an arcane, highly technical domain, an image that studies show does not resonate with all potential students and does not do justice to the potential contribution that this profession could make to solve 21st century problems. In addressing these connected challenges, engineering educators and professional bodies have invested considerable efforts towards changing perceptions of the field through research and public information campaigns. This project is examining where these perceptions, or narratives, about engineering come from, and in what ways do they exert an influence on the culture and educational practices of the field. The project draws on theory from complex systems sciences and the field of media studies to empirically investigate how collective, self-definitional narratives implicitly and pervasively shape the shared beliefs, explanations, and values that underpin the culture of engineering. By identifying and describing such exclusionary narratives, the project lays the empirical foundation for future work aimed at empowering engineering administrators, educators, and students to reach beyond the confines of narrow and limiting narratives about engineering and broaden the conversation about what engineering is, could be, and who participates in the important societal role of the profession.<br/><br/>Despite ongoing efforts to diversify engineering, undergraduate programs continue to be characterized by a predominately white, male, and privileged population with a preference for objective, convergent, and quantitative ways of thinking. Drawing on complex systems theory, this project explores this apparent systemic resistance to change as rooted in mechanisms of social autopoiesis; that is, the tendency for complex social systems to reproduce themselves through self-definitional, persistent cultural patterns. According to systems theorists, these patterns are created and maintained through communication flows that are told, retold, and enacted in the system. Leveraging prior work on perceptions and public messages of engineering, this project combines a systems thinking theoretical framework with a narrative methodology to empirically examine how engineering narratives autopoietically shape, demarcate, and otherwise influence interactions at an institutional level. <br/><br/>The research design comprises the collection and narrative analysis of publicly available news articles and engineering education and practice reports published by key professional bodies, and the exploratory ethnographic observation and narrative analysis of information exchanges about engineering in an institutional context. The project will generate an empirically grounded, theoretically coherent understanding of the engineering education system as it is embedded in larger communication networks. More specifically, the goal is to develop a systemic understanding of the communication patterns that function to privilege certain understandings of engineering over others. By empirically identifying and explicitly naming these patterns, the transformative potential of this work lies in empowering engineering educators and other stakeholders to critically examine and consequently change the dominant narratives that shape the culture of our engineering programs, in their individual interactions and ultimately at the collective national level."

How this ""branding"" actually translates to the educational experience of engineering students is the focus of this proposal. The College of Engineering (CoE) at NMSU has a diverse population of students composed of Hispanic minorities (57%), first-generation students, non-traditional students, English language learners (ELL), and students from rural communities. These unique demographics are known to impact student learning abilities, individual perception of the ability to succeed, and the ability to persevere. The overall goal of this work is to strengthen the educational experience of engineers from diverse backgrounds and identify the set of innovation and entrepreneurial resources that enhance student success. The first aim will be to correlate social self-efficacy, the belief students can succeed, to the successful formation of engineers. The second aim of this project will be to take what is learned and disseminate it. The impact of this work comes from the unique social backgrounds of underrepresented students that can impact their self-efficacy. For example, the ability for students to believe they can succeed in engineering is linked to their ""hard working"" mindset and inherent willingness to try new tasks and fail, both of which are at least partially developed through their cultural background. Conversely social influences that are unique to underrepresented minorities can increase self-doubt and decrease a student's belief that perseverance is possible in the engineering program of their choice. By correlating self-efficacy with these cultural factors we are developing an understanding of how student demographics affects long term identity as engineers. <br/><br/>Much is known about the value of innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering education. The New Mexico State University College of Engineering, like many institutions, has created resources, spaces, and opportunities to increase the creation of engineers with entrepreneurial mindsets. Despite these efforts, forces related to social identity challenge innovation self-efficacy (ISE). It is recognized that social influence plays a significant role in engineering formation, and that it is important to understand how social self-efficacy is related to engineering identity. The intellectual merit of this work addresses this disconnect through two major thrusts. The first thrust is to involve freshmen engineering students in a study that aims to measure relationships between social identity, engineering identity and the interconnection between self-efficacy and social environments. This effort will include an intervention-like study that incorporates metacognition, entrepreneurial-minded learning, design thinking activities, and assessment of the study with mock industry interviews, student surveys, and comparison to a national engineering survey. The second thrust will focus on the professional development of the principal investigators. The aim is to foster their transition from consumers of engineering education to producers of engineering education. The intent is to initiate both engineering faculty into educational research and simultaneously establish a mechanism to sustain entrepreneurial minded learning throughout core classes offered in the college. Activities by the investigators include interaction with a social sciences mentor, interaction with topical-coaches, team teaching, transformation of core engineering courses, and dissemination to other engineering faculty. The broader impacts of this work are addressed by a strong focus on underrepresented groups across the different disciplines of engineering. The project will result in practical ways to increase retention and progression of underrepresented minority students into the workforce through research-based teaching practices, role induction and socialization of minority students in engineering, and developing a true meaning of community engagement through integrated principles transcending the cultural values of the student and the engineering program."

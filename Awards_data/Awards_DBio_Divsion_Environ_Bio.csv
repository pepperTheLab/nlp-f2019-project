These forests are important in regulating the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Wildfires have reduced the amount of carbon western U.S. forests accumulate by 15-fold since the 1980s. This CAREER award will explore the critical question: is carbon recovery in burned forests changing as regional warming and consequent wildfire disturbance size increase. Innovative remote sensing using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), NEON's Airborne Observatory, and the GEDI satellite will allow rapid monitoring of forest structure at very high resolution across thousands of hectares-providing a critical and often missing scale of observations. With these remote sensing data and other advances, regional to continental scale ecology can now explore large areas at very fine scales. However major impediments exist in taking full advantage of this new technology. Training to actually harness this data revolution significantly lags behind the data availability. This CAREER award will address this need through training the next generation of Earth analysts in data and compute-intensive science, cutting-edge ecosystem carbon measuring techniques, and large-team collaboration. <br/><br/>This award will advance fundamental understanding of how aboveground biomass recovery trajectories vary as a function of fire size and severity, drought, and conifer forest type (1984-present) across the western U.S. This research will: 1) apply emerging UAS technologies and methods to estimate tree-level aboveground biomass to then explore carbon recovery post-fire in the NEON southern Rockies domain; 2) explore fundamental drivers of carbon recovery post-disturbance across a chronosequence of fire history in conifer forests of the western U.S. using space-based observations; and 3) build a national network of over 100 ecosystem scientists, predominantly graduate students, who will be enabled to conduct data-intensive exploration of forest carbon dynamics in response to disturbance within NEON domains. Education efforts include a distributed graduate seminar taught simultaneously at five universities, open education modules delivered on Earth Lab's learning portal for Earth data science that currently reaches tens of thousands of users, and a Forest Carbon Codefest that will build collaborative efforts around key methodological advances, data coding challenges, and cloud-compute workflows. Overall this CAREER award will lead to better understanding of when forests shift from carbon sinks to carbon sources under changing fire regimes and help to train the next generation of data-capable Earth scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conducting this modeling, as well as understanding the model results, requires skills in data analysis, quantitative reasoning, and computing. However, modeling and computational skills are rarely taught in undergraduate classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. This project will develop a training program that teaches thousands of students across the U.S. the foundations of macrosystems ecology through simulation modeling. Through the program, instructors and their students will learn how to quickly and efficiently run the models by using new resources emerging from computer science. Thus, students will simultaneously learn the core concepts of macrosystems science and develop the skills needed to conduct the next generation of environmental research. These concepts and skills will be embedded within teaching modules centered on the frontier of macrosystems ecology, enabling undergraduate students to contribute to high-level macrosystems research. Engaging undergraduate students in hands-on modeling activities with real-world applications translates into a workforce with increased data science, systems thinking, and quantitative skills.<br/><br/>This project will create a training program (MacroSystems EDDIE: Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry & Exploration) that connects undergraduate students with new computing tools to teach them the foundations of macrosystems science using simulation modeling. These tools will be embedded in stand-alone teaching modules that will be widely applicable to a suite of disciplines and undergraduate student experience levels. The proposed modules represent the first formalized macrosystems science curriculum for undergraduates, which will be rigorously assessed, revised, and disseminated broadly for maximum impact through a partnership with the Science Education Research Center. The modules will be designed around areas of active research inquiry e.g., interacting local and regional effects on lake temperatures, carbon cycling, the incidence of algal blooms, continental-scale water policy and students will be encouraged to develop novel questions at the frontier of macrosystems science that they will answer using simulation models. As part of the training program, the students will share their results with Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) scientific working groups to advance ongoing macrosystems research. The proposed program represents an innovative approach for teaching macrosystems biology to undergraduates and has the potential to advance undergraduate STEM education across the U.S. A minimum of 750 students will participate in the MacroSystems EDDIE modules during this project, with the potential for several thousands more through dissemination by Science Education Research Center. student participation in the Macrosystems EDDIE modules will generate scientific discoveries that will advance our understanding of macrosystems bio"

As scientists learn more about why this is happening, they are starting to realize that these lands do not always become deserts. There are other possible outcomes, such as habitats with lots of shrubs and with plants that spread rapidly from elsewhere (non-native or ""invasive"" species). The goal of this project is to test new ideas about what causes these sorts of changes. Scientists at universities and at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will work together to run experiments and collect data in the Chihuahuan Desert, where a lot can be learned from areas that have been changing in different ways. The study is especially valuable and unusual because it has been going on for more than 100 years. Scientists are not only interested in why changes are taking place but also in how those changes affect ""ecosystem function,"" which is the way that plants and animals grow, multiply and interact with each other and with the environment. Results will help scientists around the world predict and prevent harmful impacts of environmental change. Part of the project will involve training students to do research and become scientists. Many of these students will be from nearby Hispanic-serving universities. Scientists on the project will also reach out to students and teachers at local elementary, middle and high schools. They will become engaged through exciting lessons, field trips, and workshops. Discoveries from this project will be shared through workshops, talks, websites, and mobile phone Apps.<br/><br/>Chihuahuan Desert landscapes exemplify the ecological conditions, vulnerability, and management challenges in arid and semi-arid regions around the world. The overall goal of the Jornada Basin Long-Term Environmental Research (LTER) Program is to understand and quantify the key processes and factors that generate alternative states in drylands, and to predict future states and their consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services. Based on long-term databases from Agricultural Research Service of the USDA beginning in 1915, studies will include four types of dynamics: (1) a shift from perennial grasslands to desertified shrublands, (2) a reversal to grassland states, (3) transitions among shrub-dominated states, and (4) invasion by non-native grasses. These transitions have profound implications for the processes reflected in the 5 core LTER research themes. In this LTER renewal project, the ""trigger-feedback-heterogeneity"" framework for understanding and predicting the dynamics of state changes in dryland landscapes will be expanded to contribute to emerging ecological theory on: (a) alternative states and resilience, (b) ecosystem sensitivity to global change, and (c) cross-scale interactions. The novel approach will integrate knowledge and long-term data on: (1) biological processes, (2) spatial heterogeneity in the soil-geomorphic template, and (3) variability in environmental drivers drawn from multiple lines of evidence (i.e., observations, experimental manipulations, analytical and numerical models, products from imagery, conceptual model reasoning, and theory). The information management system will be expanded into a Data Science Integrated System of drylands that will allow Jornada results to be translated to other locations in the Chihuahuan Desert and to drylands globally. LTER research will result in: (1) new understanding of state changes that lead to theory development, testable hypotheses, and new experiments; (2) accessible data, derived data products, and visualization tools applicable at multiple scales; and, (3) explanatory and predictive relationships among drivers, patterns, and processes that can be used to (4) predict dynamics of alternative states at new locations or future conditions with assessments of their impacts on ecosystem services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project builds on this progress by examining communities of species within the context of their evolutionary history, asking whether close relatives respond similarly (or differently) to environmental change. This research will focus first on modelling the plants, mammals, and birds observed at NEON sites, using this information to predict regions where non-native species could invade and degrade the valuable ecosystem services that these communities provide. Building on these foundations, this project will statistically model and predict species? associations, giving insight into costly beetle pest outbreaks and ticks that can carry diseases. As part of this work, teaching materials will be developed to help under-represented groups develop data science skills and make use of the data publicly available from NEON. Additionally, the project will develop a data science class for the Native American STEM Mentorship Program at Utah State, focusing on the use and analysis of NEON data.<br/><br/>Integrating the cross-scale drivers of the distribution of biodiversity requires an understanding of both ongoing ecology and historic evolution. Species? shared evolutionary history reflects the biogeographical history that shaped them, and can inform us of constraints on species? ecology in the present. This proposal will integrate local-scale ecological community assembly with macro-scale regional assembly and trait evolution. Evolution is the context within which ecological processes take place: there can be no macro-scale synthesis of ecology without addressing phylogenetic context. This will be achieved through three major research objectives: (1) develop and release new datasets of North American plants, birds, mammals, beetles, and ticks found at and around NEON sites; (2) extend previous analyses (Phylogenetic Generalized Linear Mixed Models; PGLMMs) of the evolution of species? environmental tolerances to test macro-evolutionary models of local-scale competition within the plants, bird, and mammals of the NEON sites; and (3) extend these models to incorporate cross-guild interactions, focusing on plant-beetle and mammal-tick associations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The movement of infected humans has the potential to spark global epidemics of poorly-known mosquito-borne diseases, similar to those that occurred in the Americas following the first detection of chikungunya and Zika viruses in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The researchers will investigate the contribution of human movement patterns to mosquito-human interactions and to the spread of mosquito-borne viruses across regions (from local to continental distances). The project will seek to understand how infectious disease outbreaks influence the decisions of individuals to travel as well as marketing strategies of tourism businesses.  The team will also look at how changes in human mobility in response to outbreaks and marketing might alter outbreak paths. The project will benefit society by offering interdisciplinary education and training opportunities in disease ecology, mathematics, and geographic information science for undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in the U.S. Participatory workshops with public health and tourism stakeholders will seek to develop management strategies and actions to address mosquito-borne disease threats. The data sets developed as part of the project will be made available through public repositories accompanied by online and face-to-face educational workshops.<br/><br/>The project will use epidemiological modeling and data science techniques to model human movements and their impact on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases (i.e., chikungunya and Zika viruses), from hemispheric to local spatial scales using a rich stream of information sources (e.g., mobile phone and social media data). In particular, the researchers will evaluate the significance of the most traveled routes of real human mobility networks (i.e., the network backbone) as potential dispersal pathways for mosquito-borne viruses, and assess the ability of theoretical indicators of vital network nodes (e.g., most connected cities and countries) to predict the occurrence of super-spreading hubs of high transmission during the recent outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya. This research will incorporate human mobility as a parameter in predictive models for mosquito-borne disease risk. The results will be integrated with a social science mixed methods research approach to represent how outbreaks of infectious disease, together with associated travel warnings and changes in tourism marketing, influence individual travelers' movement choices and how these choices scale up to alter the trajectory of epidemics. The consideration of mosquito-borne disease emergence and international and domestic tourism as a coupled natural-human system will allow the researchers to assess the efficacy of different intervention strategies to inhibit transmission, the impacts of knowledge of mosquito control efforts on the health risk perceptions of travelers and tourism companies, and the potential for altered travel patterns in response to disease risk perceptions to influence the spatio-temporal trajectory of an epidemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The majority of emerging diseases, such as Ebola virus, Zika virus, SARS and pandemic influenza originate in animal populations. Many disease outbreaks occur when people alter their environment (e.g., agricultural expansion, deforestation) such that contact between wildlife, livestock, and human communities is increased. Currently, scientists, public health practitioners, and policy makers are not adequately prepared to address complex global health challenges due to limited opportunities for interdisciplinary training at undergraduate, graduate or professional stages. The EcoHealth Net 2.0 project is designed to change the current science education landscape and develop a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists who will be better prepared to study, prevent and respond to environmental changes and infectious disease. This project will develop and deliver content to thousands of students and educators on a global scale, mentor ecohealth research scientists, and create lasting connectivity among scientists and policy makers from different disciplines as they advance in their careers and face complex challenges in global health. <br/><br/>EcoHealthNet 2.0 will connect world-class research scientists from fields of medicine, ecology, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, microbiology, anthropology, climate science, data science, and economics with undergraduate and graduate STEM students from around the world to advance One Health research and education. The program has three core activities: (1) Didactic training: Selected lectures will be hosted at partner universities coupled with three 1-week workshops that will provide multidisciplinary educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the US and abroad. Workshops will teach applied skills in fields of disease ecology, science communication, and policy, providing in-person contact time with working professionals and research scientists. Lectures will be publicly webcast, reaching thousands of students and educators globally. (2) Experiential learning: Undergraduate and graduate students will be competitively selected to participate in mentored research projects that teach One Health principles and research methods. (3) Professional networking: Participants will be connected to scientific agencies and professional science and policy associations such as the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, the US Agency for International Development, the Institute of Medicine, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the One Health Alliance of South Asia."

The Mexican State of Sonora shares a 375 miles-long border with Arizona, and has a large biodiversity of insect fauna that remains very poorly known. In the case of beetles in the weevil superfamily, less than 100 species have been documented, yet nearly 1,000 species - many of them new to science - are expected to occur in Sonora. Weevils are economically important; thousands of species have either detrimental (crop pest) or beneficial (biocontrol) ecosystem impacts. This project will create a new collaboration between researchers and students at Arizona State University and two Mexican universities, with the goal of thoroughly sampling the weevil diversity of Sonora and publishing the results in a dynamic and openly accessible on-line checklist. Longstanding questions about the evolution of weevil diversity, and its relationship to their gut-inhabiting bacteria and host plant diets, will also be addressed. The project will mentor two doctoral students and undergraduate students in the concepts and methods of modern systematics and biodiversity data science. A multi-faceted education and outreach program will include the creation of a flashcard-based K-3 textbook on regional insect diversity and functional natural history. <br/><br/>The project includes an extensive field work and collection curation component, expected to yield at least 5,000 unique species/locality instances of research-ready specimens in the weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea). Field-to-data dissemination workflows will benefit from further improving the Symbiota software platform, with new options to publish data packages to external journals. The checklist will include updated taxonomic names, all specimens, species distribution maps, host plant records, images, species profile pages, and an interactive identification key to the Sonoran weevil genera as currently recognized. A well-structured metagenomics sequencing study of the gut content of more than 100 species in eight targeted weevil lineages will identify both their plant hosts and bacterial symbiont profiles. This dataset will facilitate the discovery of numerous symbiont clades, and test novel hypotheses regarding the relative impact of weevil phylogeny, biogeography, host associations, and other environmental gradients on the weevils' observed symbiont profiles<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop will bring together scientists from data science and diverse areas of biology to build an integrated understanding of the ""rules"" by which organismal biology combines with local ecological conditions to allow invasive species to expand their range and impact ecosystem function. Participants have expertise across a wide variety of organisms and ecosystems, including plants, animals, and microbes living in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. The goal of the workshop is to develop novel interdisciplinary approaches and perspectives that strengthen our understanding of invasive species impacts and how these impacts vary across locations. Such insights will fill critical knowledge gaps related to preventing and managing invasive species at the local, state, and national levels. The results will be shared through scientific publications, news media, and direct interactions with the National Invasive Species Council. <br/><br/>This workshop on the invasion biology rules of life will integrate largely distinct research approaches to enhance scientific understanding of invasion spread and impacts. Key objectives are to improve (1) prediction of both establishment of a non-native species and invasion impacts on native species and ecological processes, at more highly resolved spatial and temporal scales and (2) methods of integrating invasion observations from citizens and scientists into more highly detailed databases that, in turn, can depict not only occurrences of non-native species but also impacts. Both objectives will lead to more effective prediction and management of invasion impacts and better policies to support these goals. Participants will link mechanistic models of invasion spread, based on physiological and other traits, to species distribution models based on various statistical treatments of geographically structured environmental data. They will then assess whether the linked models produce better predictions of invasion impacts at scales relevant to management and direct researchers toward better understanding of why impacts of particular invaders vary greatly across space and time. In addition, the workshop will evaluate how best to assemble and use invasive species data gathered from a wide range of sources into integrated databases that aid research on invasion processes and impacts and assist managers and policymakers in efficiently responding to potential and actual invasions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.<br/><br/>This project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees.

Understanding how and why some groups have come to be more species-rich than other groups is a central and unsolved problem in the life sciences. One class of explanations for these differences in species numbers involves the rate at which new species arise. Using tools from genome biology and computational data science, this project will identify the mechanisms that lead to different rates of species formation and quantify their importance in a major group of vertebrate animals.  The project will provide training in genomics, geographic information systems, computational biology, and biodiversity science for students and researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Genomic resources and new scientific software developed for the project will be made publicly available, and a museum exhibit will highlight the ways in which genomics and computer programming are changing the way scientists study and understand the diversity of life forms on Earth.<br/><br/>This project will produce a novel synthesis between population biology and large-scale patterns of species diversity by integrating next-generation population genomics with a phylogenetic comparative perspective on lineage diversification rates. The project will quantify the genomic signal of several population processes to address how rates of population splitting and persistence influence speciation rates as measured on time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. These objectives will be supported by estimating phylogeographic and population genomic parameters across many species of squamate reptiles that vary in rates of speciation, and by developing new methods to link these parameters to diversification rates on phylogenetic trees. The project will also assess how organismal traits (life history, dispersal biology, population size) contribute to demographic processes that can influence the formation and persistence of incipient species.

Recent development of inexpensive oxygen sensors have allowed the widespread collection of multi-year continuous records of oxygen concentration, which can be used to precisely measure the timing of respiration.  Organic matter may be produced in the stream by algae and other aquatic plants, or may be produced by terrestrial plants, and later be delivered to streams and rivers as falling leaves, as eroded particles of soil, or dissolved in water that flows from hillslopes to channels.  These organic matter sources support the growth of animals higher in the food chain, such as insects and fish, and also provide energy for microorganisms that remove pollutants. The balance of photosynthesis and respiration in streams also influences the production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  Because organic matter can enter streams in many different ways, and because different kinds of organic matter break down at different rates, the timing of energy supply to streams also is likely to differ among streams, and to respond to many different aspects of environmental change.  This award will support strengthen and broaden the scientific workforce by supporting participation of US scientists from different career stages, regions, and backgrounds in an international conference that addresses topics at the leading edge of environmental data science; will strengthen existing connections between US and international scientists and establish new ones; and will increase the use of a newly-developed online portal (StreamPULSE; data.streampulse.org) for storage, sharing, and analysis of stream photosynthesis and respiration data  to an international workshop to develop and test ideas about the connections between the timing of organic matter supply and the timing of its decomposition, and how environmental change may alter these patterns.<br/><br/>The aim of this conference is to simultaneously advance the conceptual and technical understanding of respiration and heterotrophy in streams and rivers.  First, this conference will produce a conceptual model of aquatic heterotrophy that links forms, mechanisms, and timing of organic matter input to temporal patterns in respiration, drawing on case studies from intensive study of organic matter and respiration dynamics at diverse sites around the world.  Second, this conference will evaluate statistical methods to improve the estimation and interpretation of respiration dynamics from continuous time series of oxygen and other variables including carbon dioxide. Finally, we will integrate these technical and conceptual advances by empirically linking the dynamics of respiration to remotely-sensed estimates of organic matter supply in forested streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to estimate the total contribution of lakes in the United States to these global cycles, they have to rely on measurements from a small number of well-studied lakes because scientists do not have the resources to study every lake all the time.  The resulting extrapolations to estimate global cycles and predict future change have many uncertainties. Consequently, it is important to understand where and when information from small subsets of lakes can be accurately applied to the wide variety of lake types and landscape settings across the continental United States. To improve future extrapolation efforts and to understand the role of lakes in global nutrient cycles, this award will build an unprecedented database that combines nutrient measurements from existing government and university monitoring programs (for about 15,000 lakes) with lake and landscape characteristics from national publicly-available digital maps for all lakes in the continental United States (about 130,000 lakes).  Using this novel and unprecedented database, three components will be studied that are needed to determine the contribution of lakes to continental nutrient cycles.  First, lake nutrients will be studied jointly rather than individually to provide insights into the conditions in which cycles are linked or not, which will help to reduce uncertainty in continental estimates of lake nutrients. Second, as scientists expand their studies from a few lakes to the entire continent, the relationships between lake nutrients and their landscape controls can differ in strength and even direction among different regions, further contributing to uncertainties in continental understanding of lake nutrient cycles. Finally, compiling data on every lake increases the chance of discovering novel environmental conditions that have not previously been studied, yet may play important roles in continental-scale nutrient cycles. Through these important research activities, scientists will increase their confidence in estimating the effects of lakes on global cycles. This award contributes to the broader scientific community because the database will be made publicly-available in a timely manner to complement the National Ecological Observatory program and to developing open-source advanced computer tools for analyzing large datasets for this and other big-data studies. In addition, the diverse team (by gender, career-level, and discipline) will train and mentor early-career scientists in interdisciplinary, team-based, and data-intensive science to be leaders in addressing challenging questions such as how future land use intensification and changes in global climate will affect lakes and the services they provide. <br/><br/>Ecosystems, such as lakes, are complex, heterogeneous, and strongly influenced by their ecological context?environmental or anthropogenic factors that operate at multiple scales. This complexity makes extrapolating site-level estimates of ecological services, state, and function challenging. The overarching goal of this research is to understand and predict patterns in the three major nutrients for all continental US lakes to inform estimates of lake contributions to continental and global cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. The proposed work will address three important phenomena that limit scientists? ability to extrapolate freshwater nutrients at continental scales. (1) Because cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon in inland water interact with each other and are often affected by similar controls, they should be considered as linked, not isolated. (2) As studies expand to view the whole continent, interactions between driver variables at different scales (cross-scale interactions) also increase. (3) A hallmark of the Anthropocene is the rise of novelty in ecosystems--new environmental conditions or new combinations of conditions. Such novelty may confound extrapolation in unknown ways. The proposed research is an unprecedented effort that will: address these important phenomena, develop new continental-scale data products for aquatic macrosystems ecology, and contribute novel, data-intensive analytical methods from computer science and statistics. This award will answer five research questions related to the above phenomena using two approaches. First, funds will be used to build a large, integrated database of all lakes in the continental United States (called LAGOS-US) that includes measures of in situ nutrients collected from tens of thousands of lakes, and ecological-context metrics calculated for all 130,000 continental lakes using geographic information systems and remote sensing datasets. Second, analyses of the database will be conducted for each research question using existing and novel statistical and computer science analytical tools to improve macrosystems ecology knowledge of freshwater nutrients. This award will complement the National Ecological Observatory strengths by providing data for a broader range of aquatic ecosystems and by providing the ecological context for the six continental Observatory lake sites.

Migratory birds coordinate their departure from wintering grounds in Central or South America to arrive at North American breeding grounds at just the right time. Too early and they risk experiencing severe weather from late frosts or blizzards. Too late and they risk missing the peak in early spring insects that they depend on to successfully raise offspring. For their part, insects such as butterflies also benefit when their emergence coincides with the springtime flush of new plant growth. The timing of spring has been shifting earlier in recent years, and this raises the possibility of mismatches in spring timing between birds, insects, and plants. A few local scale studies have suggested that such mismatches may be responsible for long-term population declines for some species, but the extent of this problem, especially over large areas remains unknown. In this project, the research team will combine information on springtime weather, satellite imagery on plant emergence, and multiple large-scale citizen science data on birds, butterflies, and caterpillars to perform a comprehensive evaluation of mismatches in seasonal timing between interacting species. This work is critical for understanding the potential impacts of continued shifts in seasonality on living systems. The work will also engage K-college students and the public through a new citizen science program, educational units, and outreach events focused on learning about the timing of seasonal changes. <br/><br/>The proposed research will be the first attempt to examine phenological mismatch across three trophic levels at a semi-continental extent. Local-scale studies have documented specific instances of phenological mismatch but fail to inform how mismatch consequences propagate across spatial, temporal, or trophic scales. Birds and butterflies provide the most expansive, long-term and detailed macroecological data sets on distribution, diversity, and demography. The project will unite multiple large-scale citizen science datasets for these taxa with targeted field data collection, and remotely-sensed climate and vegetation data layers, to examine the cross-scale and multi-trophic interactions that connect shifting thermal environments, phenological mismatch, and fitness consequences.

For example, different temperatures, diets, pathogens and altitudes have led to local adaptations. Adaptations occur through the selection and increase of beneficial mutations in genes in a population, which can arise spontaneously by random mutation or can be acquired through admixture with another population. Analysis of human genomes has shown that some of our beneficial mutations have come from archaic human populations like the Neanderthals and Denisovans, facilitated by interbreeding between modern humans and those groups tens of thousands of years ago. This process is referred to as adaptive introgression. While there are a few examples of beneficial mutations in genes arising from adaptive introgression, in this project tools will be built to scan human genomes to identify more candidate genes for adaptive introgression and to fully characterize the importance of this process in many human populations. Importantly, the project will involve training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational science and genomics, and the tools created will be freely accessible for others to use. In addition, a new interdisciplinary course that bridges data analysis of human genetic variation, programming, statistics and biology will be offered to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>Detecting and characterizing adaptation has mostly been approached through two models: selection on de novo mutations (SDN) or selection on standing variation (SSV). Therefore it is assumed that a population either has to wait for a beneficial mutation to arise de novo or it harbors enough neutral standing variation that can become beneficial under a change in environment. However, most populations do not live in isolation and have exchanged genetic variants with other populations through admixture (gene-flow from a donor population to a recipient population). This process is an evolutionary force that may accelerate adaptation in the recipient population. The PI will model positive selection and gene-flow jointly to investigate the patterns of genetic variation under this model, to compare and contrast to the two other models of positive selection (SDN, SSV), to determine what summaries of the data accurately distinguishes adaptive gene flow from SDN and SSV, to develop novel statistics that accurately detect this type of selection and to develop statistical and computational tools to scan genomes to identify candidate regions. These tools will be applied to real data sets in humans and in other organisms. The broader impacts include training a postdoc, students, building a project-oriented course that integrates multiple disciplines (programming, statistics and modeling) that will teach students to visualize biological data sets for exploratory analyses, to test hypothesis and to fit models to the data, and bringing science to high school students through a series of lectures. Finally, all computational tools developed under this grant will be made freely available to the scientific community."

However, as genetic datasets rapidly grow in size due to technological advances, a number of hurdles arise when trying to estimate such relationships. Though many methods have been developed to address these challenges, one source of error that is not accounted for by available methods is non-random mating in ancient populations. Because individuals generally do not mate randomly, and because population and species relationships are used to answer diverse research questions from basic science to epidemiology, addressing this source of error is critical. The primary goal of this project is to design statistical methods for estimating population and species relationships that account for non-random mating in ancient populations, thereby increasing the accuracy of estimation. Moreover, it is of high priority that both the scientific community and the public are engaged in the advances of this project. To this end, the researchers will make all approaches developed during this project freely available for use by the wider scientific community. Also, the researchers will work with K-12 students in hands-on activities for learning why and how to build population and species relationships through the Penn State Science-U program. Finally, the researchers will engage indigenous peoples as part of the Summer internship for INdigenous peoples in Genomics (SING) Workshop which examines the use of genomic data in science and society.<br/><br/>Ancestral structure, which has been uncovered in many diverse species, can skew gene tree frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of methods for estimating species trees. This research seeks to develop novel likelihood methods that can infer phylogenies under such scenarios, and apply these methods to test evolutionary hypotheses about ancestral structure and gene flow in several model and non-model organisms. The model organisms considered will be mouse, yeast, and mosquito, for which previous studies have observed skewed gene tree frequencies that were attributed to gene flow through hybridization, but may instead be the result of ancestral structure. The researchers will also apply these methods to a non-model coral system, which is of particular interest because morphological and fossil data provide evidence of hybridization, suggesting that this system may exhibit skewed gene tree frequencies. Application to these systems will serve to elucidate and refine knowledge of the events shaping the evolution of these lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investment to collect, develop, and distribute data and tools to further large-scale and long-term science is exemplified by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) initiatives. These, and similar initiatives, represent a paradigm shift in the way future scientific discovery will occur. This Career award will develop theoretical, methodological, software, and instructional advancements that will allow current and future scientists and educators to draw valid inference about large and complex ecological systems by: assimilating disparate sources and types of data; accommodating spatial and temporal dependence to satisfy statistical model assumptions and improve predictive inference; partitioning and propagating sources of uncertainty through fine spatial scale predictions over large domains, and; scaling to effectively exploit information in massive datasets. The research will develop new flexible spatio-temporal modeling frameworks tailored to enable assessment of NEON's Grand Challenges in the areas of climate change, land use, invasive species, biogeochemistry, biodiversity, ecohydrology, and infectious diseases. Although development of the proposed methods is motivated by substantive questions related to NEON's mission, potential advancements in spatio-temporal data modeling will find use in fields such as public and environmental health, meteorology, engineering, and geosciences where the fundamental goal is the same -- use new findings to help improve society.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed educational objectives will enable students to explore their particular research interests, exploit complex data to build new understanding, and learn to collaborate to address challenges and opportunities within and across their respective disciplines. The award will develop and deliver several integrative education activities including: i) the development and implementation of cross-college undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Geo- and Eco-Informatics; ii) an undergraduate senior-level course in applied environmental data modeling; iii) a graduate-level course focused on more advanced topics in hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling; iv) enrichment of science instruction in 23 K-12 schools in 13 districts in southwestern Michigan, and; v) graduate research symposia focused on contemporary topics in environmental data analysis that will engage students and experts from multiple institutions and serve as an opportunity for the graduates to share their research, network, garner specialized skills, and learn about NEON data products.

Many questions remain about how organic matter is removed from freshwaters.  A key challenge is that not all organic matter is the same.  Organic matter dissolved in freshwaters is made up of many different compounds. These compounds range in age, source, and chemical composition, all of which can influence how fast they are processed.  To overcome this challenge, researchers will collect real-time sensor data and design field-scale experiments to measure how fast organic matter is removed by streams. The project aims to test hypotheses about what processes control the removal of different types of organic matter from streams and rivers.  This is important because organic matter provides energy that supports food webs, and can pollute downstream ecosystems. Organic matter processing can also determine rates of greenhouse emissions from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. This research will also provide valuable opportunities for high school teachers to engage in investigations that will enhance their ability to meet Next-Generation Science standards.<br/><br/>What processes drive organic carbon removal in streams, and how does organic carbon removal regulate the degree to which running waters are biological reactors versus exporters of organic carbon?  These are key unresolved questions in carbon cycle research.  This project will develop a proof-of-concept approach to test the hypothesis that non-additive effects of mixed organic matter sources (i.e. priming) control organic carbon removal in streams.  Data products will include estimates of organic carbon turnover distance derived from ecosystem metabolism and stream chemistry, as well as empirical measures of organic carbon removal from ecosystem-level experiments that use single-source and mixed organic carbon additions.  Project data and computer source codes will be shared openly via HydroShare and GitHub, respectively.

Phenology is thus critical for many ecological processes. It also directly influences ecosystem productivity and the production of many goods and ecosystem services on which human society is reliant. Importantly, phenological rhythms are highly sensitive to year-to-year variability in weather, but they can also in turn influence weather itself. Thus, there are feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere that are phenologically-controlled. This project will use imagery from a network of digital cameras--the PhenoCam Network--to track vegetation phenology at high spatial and temporal resolution across North America, from tundra to the tropics. Together with sophisticated computer simulations, this project will then investigate phenologically-controlled ecosystem-atmosphere feedbacks across a climatic gradient from the Southwest, through the Great Plains, and into the Northeastern US. The question this project seeks to answer is, How much influence do these feedbacks have on how ecosystems work, and at what spatial and temporal scales? This question is important from the point of view of managing and sustaining healthy ecosystems. Public participation in scientific research will be achieved through collaboration with the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Project's Schoolyard program and the Summer Research Program. Through these efforts this project will contribute to the education and training of traditionally under-represented groups. This project additionally includes interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for graduate-level students and three postdoctoral research associates.

Specifically, this project investigates: (1) How does phenology regulate the strength of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling across a continental-scale ecoclimatic gradient? (2) How does the seasonality of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling vary within and across this gradient? and, (3) How do coupled ecosystem-atmosphere dynamics influence ecosystem function at local to continental spatial scales and seasonal to interannual timescales? The researchers will derive phenological metrics by applying image analysis methods to time series of digital camera images from PhenoCam. Formal model selection criteria will be used to test and evaluate different model structures for the phenology of key plant functional types.

However, such data do not take advantage of recent advances in molecular biology that have greatly expanded our ability to characterize the microbial organisms that are often critical to remediation efforts.  In this project, the investigator, who since 1991 has studied a contaminated aquifer, will connect his data on that aquifer to recent data generated by advanced genomic methods in molecular biology.  The molecular data of DNA and RNA sequences, will provide the researcher with an opportunity to explore the limits, frontiers, and pragmatic relationships between geochemical data and molecular characterizations of the microbial organisms and potentially discover how the metabolism of the microbial assemblages determines aquifer geochemistry. <br/><br/>The researcher has studied both microbial and geochemical properties of a shallow aquifer near the Hudson River in South Glens Falls, NY, which is contaminated with naphthalene-rich coal-tar waste. This project is designed to gain new insights into the microbial biogeochemistry of the biodegradation of pollutant compounds.  The overarching goal of this OPUS project is to merge previous geochemical and microbial data with recently-created DNA sequencing data, specifically omics information generated by a United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute microbial community sequencing project. The researcher will use statistical and other analytical procedures to discern new causal relationships between the dynamic microbiological and geochemical processes at this site. Information about key processes catalyzed in this subsurface site will deepen understanding about the composition and function of microorganisms dwelling in this study site and establish principles that can be transferred to other ecological settings.

The world is rapidly losing biodiversity, and understanding how biodiversity loss will affect ecosystem services is important for human well-being. Most attempts to do this have used experiments in the field and laboratory. Natural communities, in which ecosystem services are provided, rarely look like experiments. Scientists acknowledge this, but it has been hard to study the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services in the real world, in large part because of limitations in the analysis of complex natural communities. In this project, the researchers will use a new method that overcomes previous limitations to analyze some of the world's largest data sets, with the goal of understanding what aspects of natural communities are needed for ecosystem services. For example, is it enough to have many individuals of a few species, or do we need many different species to provide ecosystem services? This research will provide society benefits through a better understanding of how biodiversity influences ecosystem function, which could have relevance for science policy. Additionally, data and coding from the project will be made available to the public. <br/><br/>Knowledge of what drives ecosystem services at large scales is rudimentary, and the widespread belief that species richness is necessary for ecosystem services in natural systems is more of an assumption than an established fact. This project will use a novel and powerful analytical approach, based on the Price equation from evolutionary biology, to determine the importance of biodiversity to multiple ecosystem services. Specifically, the Price equation partitions differences in ecosystem services into three additive terms: richness, composition, and context dependence (which includes abundance variation as well as environmental factors). The PIs will compile the largest and most complete publicly-available data sets, and use them to conduct a synthetic analysis. The research will determine: (1) the relative importance of richness, composition, and context dependence in producing the mean levels and temporal variance of ecosystem services, (2) the role of spatial and temporal scale in ecosystem functions, and (3) the extent to which data from the worlds' largest biodiversity-function experiments align with results from ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More is known about their morphology, species distributions, behavior, and larval resources than any other insect group. However, this information needs to be synthesized, placed in an evolutionary context, and made available for research.

All of this information will be made available to the public via a website with the goal of catalyzing synthetic research and comparative studies. In addition to public outreach and education, the members of the research team will train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in systematics and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This project will produce a set of online tools and databases for comparative studies of butterflies. At the heart of the project is the assembly of a molecular phylogeny incorporating all known butterfly species. A hierarchical approach will be used to reconstruct butterfly relationships. To create a robust backbone phylogeny, approximately 500 loci will be captured from a single exemplar species from within each of the ~1,800 genera using anchored enrichment prior to sequencing. Genetic data from public databases and from our own sequencing efforts will then be collected to include remaining known species and complete the phylogeny. Model-based inference will examine the complexity of speciation, extinction, biogeography, and trait evolution. Existing locality data will be assembled from museum collections, inventories, citizen science monitoring networks, and expert knowledge to model species distributions using the integrative Map of Life framework. Species trait data have already been assembled for some groups and regions, but this project will create a consistent, harmonized trait database while also closing major gaps to create a globally comprehensive compilation of trait data on species life history, interactions, ecology, and distributions. All of these data layers will be made available through the Map of Life online platform, thus delivering community vetted and curated data and tools to catalyze comparative research."

Mutations in DNA can lead to duplication where a stretch of a DNA sequence is copied. In these situations both gene copies will be maintained only if they both contribute to the fitness of an individual by evolving to have different functions. Thus, it is expected that a mutation of one gene copy that eliminates its function will reduce fitness. Contrary to this expectation, effects of such mutation appear to indicate that duplicate genes share the same function. This project will explore this contradiction by looking at the effects of mutations in duplicated genes in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. The fitness effects of these mutations will be measured and combined with existing data to predict the degree of redundancy between duplicate genes. Ultimately, this knowledge is essential for deciphering how duplicate genes contribute to disease as well as novel traits that are important in medical science, agriculture and in generating new species. The project will also train several undergraduate and graduate students and provide outreach to the general public.<br/><br/>Because overestimates of genetic redundancy present a major challenge in understanding why duplicate genes are retained, more accurate measures of genetic redundancy between duplicate genes are necessary. In this proposal, lifetime fitness differences between single mutants (with mutations in each duplicate), double mutants (mutations in both duplicates), and wild type plants will be compared in the growth chamber and in the field for 240 pairs of A. thaliana duplicate genes. The resulting fitness data will be integrated with data from large-scale molecular functional studies, comparative genomic data, and existing phenotype information to establish statistical models that can predict genetic redundancy of any duplicate gene pair. The proposed work will advance evolutionary genetic studies of duplicate genes by producing more accurate, fitness-based measures of genetic redundancy. These measures are essential for estimating the strength of purifying selection acting on each duplicate copy, which in turn is central for understanding why duplicate genes persist. In addition to lifetime fitness, multiplicative fitness components will be estimated to help identify the selective agents underlying retention. The proposed research will also allow the assessment of how single and double mutants of duplicate genes differ in their fitness effects (additivity, antagonistic or synergistic epistasis) and if the fitness effects are greater in more stressful field environments. The project will also lead to a novel, quantitative model of genetic redundancy that will integrate fitness, phenotype, comparative/functional genomics data that to date have been mostly studied in isolation. The model will allow prediction of genetic redundancy genome-wide and is expected to be applicable across a broad range of taxa, including non-model organisms. Finally, because heterogeneous molecular data relevant to gene functions will be integrated, the model will also provide insight into the mechanisms leading to redundancy between duplicate genes."

They also influence climate because they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. This project will better quantify both the influence of climate variation on tree growth and how much carbon is sequestered each year by forests by using two complementary data sets, the national forest inventory and tree-ring data. These data come from the U. S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. This inventory program evaluates the current state and future trajectory of the nation's forests from measurements in a network of permanent sample plots. The plots are revisited and measurements are made once each decade in the western US. A spatially complete set of tree cores collected in the forest inventory plots contains information on the relationship between year-to-year variation in climate and tree growth, recorded in annual growth rings. The combined data will be used to study forest productivity across broad spatial scales and make predictions of ecosystem state, ecosystem services, and natural capital. This study will produce ecological forecasts relevant to society and informing strategies for climate adaptation. The project will also provide research experience and professional development for a post-doctoral fellow and undergraduates, open-source code for reproducible science, and outreach to schools and the public at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. <br/><br/>There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the future functioning of forest ecosystems, especially carbon sequestration, in the face of rising temperatures and evaporative demand. The focus of this project is the particularly vulnerable forest macrosystem of the interior western United States. Forest ecosystem functioning at this large scale will be analyzed by leveraging an existing, continental-scale ecological observatory network (the permanent sample plot network of the U. S. Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Program) and assimilating into it a new data stream with annual-resolution information on individual tree growth from increment cores collected in the same forest plot network. A hierarchical Bayesian multiple regression approach will be used to quantify the drivers of forest productivity across spatial scales and explain the effects of individual tree size, forest stand structure, geophysical conditions, disturbances, climate and their cross-scale interactions on tree-level and forest stand-level above-ground woody biomass production. Estimates of the effects of these drivers and their interactions will be used to make ecological forecasts of future tree- and stand-level productivity under various scenarios of stand density and stand size structure, including estimates of forecasting uncertainty. Data assimilation on this large scale will be supported by the cyberinfrastructure of NSF's CyVerse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For decades, ecologists have been studying animal movement behaviors using radio-telemetry and more recently global positioning systems (GPS). GPS technology has recently advanced such that many smaller animals can now be accurately and intensively tracked.  Additionally, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has begun collecting detailed environmental data at sites throughout North America. The NEON platform and new GPS technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to merge highly accurate animal movement data with equally accurate environmental data to better understand how animals interact with their environment and predict how they may do so into the future.  In this project, researchers propose to use the southeastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) as a model for demonstrating how linking NEON and animal movement data can transform wildlife research by allowing scientists to obtain a detailed look into how animals are influenced by, and interact with their environment. Researchers hope to use lessons learned from this project to provide guidance for broader implementation of these technologies across NEON sites, ultimately increasing the capacity of scientists to better understand how organisms interact with their environment. Additionally, the researchers plan to share information and develop educational tools (e.g., web sites showing southeastern fox squirrel movements, videos of simulated animal movement paths, classroom presentations of tools and techniques, etc.) for use in public school systems via local science education initiatives. <br/><br/>Investigators will affix small GPS receivers to southeastern fox squirrels to monitor fine-scaled spatiotemporal movements at NEON sites in southwestern Georgia and central Florida. Environmental data will be obtained from NEON for each of these sites.  Fox squirrel locations and movements will be modeled as functions of predictor variables obtained from NEON. These efforts will provide an example of linking highly accurate spatial data to address how animals move and interact with their environment at fine scales and across broad areas. The goals of the project are to provide:  (1) proof of concept, (2) assessment of the current NEON data collection schedule relative to animal movements, and (3) suggestions for implementation of high-resolution animal movement studies across NEON domains.

By unraveling these interrelationships, the historical causes and consequences of biological phenomena ranging from disease to diet can be understood. Decades of research has shed light on many regions of the Tree, but still, many relationships are poorly understood.  Recent technological advancements now allow biological researchers to collect DNA sequence data from the genomes of organisms on an unprecedented scale, and these massive data have the potential to untangle these difficult branching patterns in the Tree of Life. However, much remains to be learned about how genomes evolve across the many branching events of the Tree. This project will use these large DNA sequence data sets to study the branching patterns of evolutionary relationships in Strepsirrhine primates, a group that contains the highly endangered lemurs of Madagascar, and salamandrid salamanders, a diverse group of amphibians most commonly known as the newts. These two very different organismal groups will be used to answer questions about how different types of genes evolve at the molecular level as the lineages that contain them diversify and split over time.  This will help evolutionary biologists answer the important question of which data from across the genome is best sampled to properly infer the organismal placement in the Tree of Life. This project will involve participants across multiple levels of education, including undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as established faculty. This research will inform conservation planning of these two iconic organisms.  Additionally the research will link with public outreach activities at the Duke Lemur Center and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Science.<br/> <br/> This research project will use next generation DNA sequence technology to sequence large portions of strepsirrhine primates and salamandrid salamanders genomes.  These data will include hundreds of loci under positive selection as well as hundreds of loci from neutrally evolving parts of the genome. Analyses of these data will explore the ways in which massive data sets can be used in phylogeny reconstruction. The phylogenetic reconstruction will be focused within groups which have exhibited patterns of recent and rapid species radiations and contain branches that have challenged phylogenetic reconstruction. The researchers will assess the performance of genes under positive selection in reconstructing difficult clades. While the use of genes under selection is something typically avoided in molecular phylogenetics, properties of these positive-selection loci suggest that they may be an ideal source of phylogenetic information for the most challenging of branches. The loci under positive-selection will be annotated by gene properties thereby providing a tremendous wealth of gene ontology information. The researchers will assess the performance of functional classes of genes in phylogeny reconstruction to gauge whether particular functional classes of genes are better at recovering phylogeny. Overall, the results of this project will provide empirically-derived solutions to the phylogenetics community for how a genomic data can be used to solve challenging phylogenetic questions."

Many of the world's most devastating and neglected infectious diseases require mosquitoes and other insects for transmission between people. Malaria kills over 650,000 people each year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa, and pathogens like West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus are on the rise in both North America and the tropics. Mosquitoes and the pathogens they carry are sensitive to the environment, so changes in climate, particularly temperature, affect disease risk both in the tropics and in temperate areas. This award supports research to measure the effect of temperature on 13 different pathogens that use mosquitoes and flies for transmission, and the capacity for two common mosquitoes in the Americas to adapt to different temperature conditions. In addition, this work will support STEM education through training in science and math with a focus on under-represented groups, and will contribute publicly available data that can be used by other researchers and public health professionals.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a general framework for predicting the temperature sensitivity of vector transmission. This work addresses three main questions: (1) How does vector-borne pathogen transmission respond to temperature? (2) How important is the influence of temperature, relative to other factors, on transmission in the field? (3) Can such transmission adapt to local temperature regimes? The research will develop temperature-sensitive transmission models and fit them with data from the existing literature for 13 vector-borne diseases: vivax malaria, trypanosomiasis, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Ockelbo (Sindbis) disease, Ross River fever, and bluetongue. Laboratory experiments will measure local thermal adaptation of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, which transmit dengue and other viruses, from across their geographic and temperature ranges. In tandem, the research will develop and test theory on how vectors and parasites respond to temperature based on theory from physiological ecology. New local-scale data collected in Ecuador on transmission risk, dengue cases, climate, and other social and economic factors will be used to validate the model predictions. Complementing these local-scale data, the research will develop a global database on field transmission from the existing literature, along with climatic and socioeconomic information. Together, these field data will test the accuracy of the transmission models and assess the relative importance of temperature for transmission at scales from neighborhood to continent."

Mangroves are a predominant vegetation type of tropical and subtropical coasts around the world. They support diverse, highly productive food webs, and provide valuable ecosystem services such as nursery habitat for fishery species, wintering habitat for migratory birds, protection of coastlines from storm surge, and below-ground storage of large stocks of carbon. Despite the considerable value of these ecosystems, mangrove habitats are severely threatened by coastal development, pollution, and conversion to aquaculture. A central goal of this research project is to enhance our ability to predict the responses of mangrove ecosystems to both natural and human-caused disturbances; this knowledge will help guide efforts to restore these highly valuable ecosystems. This goal will be achieved by identifying general mechanisms underlying these ecosystem responses through analyses of data from long-term experimental and observational studies, and from the predictions of a mathematical model of forest dynamics. Information about the rich biology of these systems, and the findings of this and similar studies in the region will be shared with other ecologists, their students, and amateur naturalists in a PI-authored book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. This project will also involve undergraduate student assistants, maintaining the investigator's long commitment to training young scientists and guiding them to careers in science.<br/><br/>The first phase of this research will complete comprehensive analyses of data from long-term observational and experimental field investigations of the factors that control the structure and dynamics of the study forests. Forest demography and composition have been documented by monitoring the fates of individually marked trees in six forests plots that were established in 1993. These observational data are complemented by two long-term field experiments, initiated in 1995 and 1999, that test the independent and interactive effects of competition and herbivory on light gap regeneration and the spatial distributions of species along the tidal gradient. The results of these analyses will be synthesized with a spatially-explicit model of mangrove forest dynamics, parameterized with tree demographic data collected from the forest plots and field experiments. Model simulations will predict changes in forest composition and age/spatial structure under a range of environmental scenarios. The final phase of the project will be devoted to designing and writing a photo-illustrated book on the ecology of neotropical mangrove forest communities. It will be the first of its kind for the region. While focusing on the rich biology of these systems and key ecological processes that shape their structure and dynamics, the book will highlight the dire circumstances faced by mangrove ecosystems and discuss approaches to their protection and sustainable management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These wetlands support specialized plant, microbe and animal species that collectively form some of the Earth's most productive ecosystems, influencing the ecology of estuaries and coastal oceans. Coastal wetlands are also under severe pressure from human activity which threatens to diminish the many benefits they provide to people and aquatic food webs. Among these benefits is the fact that they remove large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and bury it in soils for centuries to millennia. Indeed, these ecosystems account for nearly 50 percent of the organic carbon buried in sediments despite occupying less than 2 percent of terrestrial area. This surprising fact suggests an opportunity: that protecting, restoring and managing coastal ecosystems could improve the ecological and social benefits they provide. The pace of research on this topic has accelerated and there is a great need to coordinate ongoing research and synthesize existing information. The goal of this Research Coordination Network (RCN) project is to advance understanding of carbon cycling in coastal wetlands by creating a central repository for sharing data, and facilitating synthesis and modeling to better predict the functioning of coastal ecosystems.<br/> <br/><br/>The Coastal Wetland Carbon Research Coordination Network will accelerate scientific discovery, advance science-informed policy, and improve coastal ecosystem management by: (1) developing a community dedicated to coastal wetland carbon science for basic research, policy development, and management, (2) exploring the ecological links among coastal wetlands, estuaries, and the atmosphere, and (3) sharing data and analysis tools that support the diverse needs of scientists, policy makers and managers. Activity 1 will establish a repository for participant-contributed data, and a central portal for downloading data from repositories of interest to the coastal carbon community. Activity 2 will create a Coastal Wetland Carbon website to attract participation of diverse users by providing a variety of resources that meet their needs. It will provide data analysis tools, a knowledge sharing resource, a video library of training modules in standard methods, a code library to support modeling, links to publications, and a webinar library. This RCN project will also provide outreach via a series of webinars and town hall gatherings at professional meetings, host a series of workshops on scientific gaps in coastal carbon, and develop a web-based tool for modeling."

In fact, modern societies are global networks of goods and services that are entirely dependent on freshwater.  Rapid global changes threaten many freshwater ecosystems across the globe, and the human networks that depend on them. Given the 100+ million lakes across the globe, very little is known about the role of lakes in regional-to-continental and even global-scale landscape function. The limited understanding comes from in-depth study of a handful of lakes, and it is assumed these represent the whole. What is needed is an expansion of studies to regions, continents, and ultimately the globe and to put that knowledge in the system contexts in which lakes sit - their atmospheric and surrounding land systems. Diverse perspectives, tools, and networks must be brought together to understand how global influences affect local water quality, the role of freshwater lakes in landscapes, and whether there are scaling rules (space and time) for generating regional- to continental- to cross-continental models for understanding how lake function. This need is far too vast to be the exclusive purview of any existing academic, research, federal, or private-sector network.  This project will build a global network of networks that includes scientists, as well as citizen scientists, to understand lake function over a variety of spatial and temporal scales and with different intensities of human-induced change.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to use lessons, data, and physical and human infrastructure developed within the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network to build an inclusive global network of networks capable of synthesizing information about lakes in the context of their connections to and feedbacks from the atmospheric, terrestrial, and human landscapes in which they sit. The assembly of resources, including human, data, and technical, will work in concert with the global network as a Research Coordination Network in the service of diverse teams of scientists who can take on big macrosystem science questions with effectiveness and persistence. Specifically, the proposed work will (i) develop a network capacity for incorporating and studying the interactions of atmosphere-terrestrial-aquatic systems by expanding their resource availability, human expertise, and connection to existing research programs; (ii) build on an existing, successful, learning organization that can accommodate new disciplines and needs; and (iii) use the enhanced/expanded network to provide a new capacity for doing the science of - and scientific training essential for - macrosystems biology about lakes embedded in atmosphere-terrestrial-human landscapes. Cross cutting scientific themes include exploration of feedbacks among and drivers in atmospheric-terrestrial-lake ecosystems, controls on material flow, and scaling from ecosystems to macrosystems.  Early career scientists will be encouraged to lead expeditions, with later career scientists as co-leaders. Based on past experience, this model builds the team for team science, leads to a major expansion of collaborative networks for participants, especially for early career scientists, and results in innovative interdisciplinary products.

This research project will investigate the tree of life of living and fossil groups of marine snails, and the changes that happened in the shape of their shells through geological time. Snail shells are an iconic example of an organisms' effective defense against predators. With more than 30,000 described living species and countless fossils, snails are the most diverse group of invertebrate animals in the oceans; the diversity of their shell forms being equally impressive. Their rich fossil record shows a transition of shell features starting in the middle of the Mesozoic Era, around 160 million years ago. At that time, while dinosaurs thrived on land, fishes and crabs with increasing capacity of crushing shells were diversifying in the oceans. Changes in shell shape are thus hypothesized to be an evolutionary response to increased predation. If predation pressure was indeed an important driver during the evolution of shell shape, a general dominance of better-defended forms would be expected after the mid-Mesozoic. The researchers will gather data from an ample set of shells from fossil and living species to infer how they are related to each other and to estimate the times of origin of snail groups with different shapes; these results will be used to investigate the trajectory of the shell shape during the Mesozoic. Results from this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and science blogs broadly accessible to the public. A large number of shell images will be produced and made available online, including websites for science communication. In addition, high school and undergraduate students will be mentored in their first experience in science.<br/> The members of Vetigastropoda, the specific group of marine snails under study (including abalone, key-hole limpets, top-shells and others), present great variation in shell height and level of coiling. Shorter and less coiled shells are particular features that could offer mechanical resistance against shell crushing. This study will test the hypotheses that: (1) the morphospace of shells became more restricted in response to predator selective pressure, and (2) the trajectory of shell shape trended towards shorter and less spired forms. Hypothesis testing will be accomplished by adding shell morphological data to a molecular phylogeny inferred from high-throughput sequence data. The fossil data will provide the basis for estimating divergence times in the phylogeny of vetigastropods, and for the comparison among distinct models of trait evolution."

At the same time, forest cover over the region has increased dramatically, driven by abandonment of poor quality agricultural lands.  This project will test the hypothesis that reforestation in the eastern U.S. provides the explanation, in that it affects the surface energy balance in ways that lead to cooling and thus obscures long-term warming from climate change.  Just as human bodies are cooled by sweating or by a fan, forests may be cooled by greater rates of evapotranspiration and wind-driven movement of heat energy when compared to the croplands and grasslands they have replaced.  Looking forward, the rate of reforestation will decline over time as available space is filled, but the types of trees that fill in naturally or are planted will likely change.  Notably, drought-tolerant oaks are currently declining, while drought-sensitive maples and pines are proliferating.  So this work will also test a second hypothesis that ongoing regional shifts in tree species promote a reduction in evapotranspiration, particularly during periods of drought, that will tend to warm the surface.  The research will inform the development of sustainable agro-ecosystem management strategies that mitigate damaging effects of drought on ecosystem productivity and function.  A series of workshops will be developed, along with a citizen science program aimed at training young scientists in effective approaches for leveraging and analyzing network data.<br/><br/>The research will be enabled by interactions with a range of environmental observation networks, which aggregate meteorological and ecological observations from many ecosystems and thereby enable a big data approach to environmental science. Project outcomes are relevant to ongoing modelling efforts to reproduce historic climate trends and predict future conditions with more confidence. This work will advance network-driven environmental science by generating a rich collection of leaf- to ecosystem scale observations that will be shared with existing networks. The research is motivated by the recognition that, within the study region, ongoing management activities are driving a transition from forests dominated by species that are more anisohydric in their water use to forests dominated by more isohydric species. The concept of isohydry has received much attention in recent years, and this project will advance this body of knowledge by classifying important eastern U.S. species along the isohydric-anisohydric continuum, and developing a model for stomatal conductance that incorporates the isohydric-anisohydric framework.  While this project is focused on ecosystem energy balance, the project outcomes will also be relevant for efforts to understand regional carbon and water cycling, and for the development of forest management strategies that mitigate deleterious effects of drought on ecosystem functioning"

A particularly striking feature of global plant distributions is that sub-Saharan Africa has many fewer plant species than comparable tropical regions in Asia and the Americas, which is known as the ""odd man out"" biogeographic pattern. This research will investigate the possible causes of the odd man out pattern by investigating the evolutionary history of ferns. Ferns are an ancient plant group that occupy diverse ecosystems globally. Consequently, they are ideal models for understanding the roles of extinction, speciation and migration in generating the modern-day flora of sub-Saharan Africa. Broader impacts of the project will build research capacity among early career scientists, including post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Florida and strengthen biodiversity science education within diverse K-12 and college classrooms. Project personnel will develop a study-abroad undergraduate course in southern Africa, engage middle school teachers in developing K-12 lesson plans, and build both web-based and hands-on modules for public outreach about plants and biodiversity science. <br/><br/>Researchers will uncover the evolutionary and biogeographic history of three fern genera (Dryopteris, Cheilanthes, Polystichum) that are widespread in African, Asian and the American continents to investigate the genesis of the odd man out biogeographic pattern. Species will be sampled in the field and from herbaria; DNA sequence data from approximately 450 nuclear markers will be used to generate their phylogenies. The resulting phylogenies will be used to reconstruct historical biogeographic movements of over 1000 species, calculate diversification rates, and determine whether shifts in ancestral ecological niche envelopes correlate with migration events or changes in diversification rate. Ancestral climate reconstructions and trait data from common garden experiments will be co-analyzed to understand how climate may have shaped traits and diversification patterns over time. The project will generate new data resources and specimens for broad dissemination and build cross-institutional collaborations.

Obtaining the complete Tree of Life for all living things is a grand challenge in science, on the same intellectual scale as investigating the nature of matter or the origin of the universe: it is fundamental to understanding our world, central to human sustainability, and critical as a framework for future discovery. Scientists have made major progress toward this challenge by combining biology with computer science and successfully generating large genealogies of thousands and even millions of species. These large phylogenetic trees are now available to researchers in many branches of biology -- from genomics to ecology -- and have great promise for applied science in medicine, agriculture, industry, and climate-change mitigation. It is critical that scientists develop a future vision for this area of scientific exploration and make clear the central role of phylogenetics in the strategic integration of biodiversity science across US academic, corporate and government institutions. To achieve this vision, this project has developed a three-year program of catalysis meetings and workshops to bring together and enlarge the Tree of Life community.

Complicating this challenge is the knowledge that tropical forests are expected to change as they become warmer and as rainfall patterns change. This long-term study of tropical forest biodiversity tackles this challenge by focusing on the important phases of a tree's life, including seed and seedling production by mature trees, the growth and survival of those seedlings, and the growth and survival of mature trees. The project extends a 13-year record of seedling and mature tree surveys in five forest stands in Costa Rica, with the goal of developing models of critical aspects of forest regeneration - seedling production, dispersal, growth, and survival - in response to light, soil nutrients, rainfall, and temperature. Tree life cycles are typically long, some species reproduce only once every 12 or more years, and many trees live for hundreds of years. The longer-term data collected as part of this study are therefore essential to capture a greater part of the tree life cycle and to span variation in weather conditions. The data and models resulting from the study will identify major mechanisms of species co-existence, helping to explain the unusually high diversity in tropical forests.<br/><br/>Improved understanding of the factors that govern the abundance of tree species will aid in predicting forest responses to environmental changes, which is critical to timber production, wildlife habitat, and forest carbon storage. Results will also improve predictions of how some of the most diverse communities on the plant respond to warmer temperatures, reduced rainfall and increasing deposition of chemical pollutants. The project will educate and train students, make valuable long-term data publicly available, and promote science education of the general public through activities at Science Festivals and a website."

The steep rugged landscape interacts with a wet climate to create many kinds of habitats, each with its own responses to environmental change. These forests have been continually changing following the last ice age, and humans have played a role in those changes through the activities of Native Americans, colonization by Europeans and frontier farming activities, air pollution associated with acid precipitation, modern land use practices, the introduction of forest diseases and invasive species, fire management policies, and a changing climate. The forests of the Appalachian Mountains contribute ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, water and air purification, and wildlife habitat. This research seeks to describe and understand how this ecosystem and the services it provides respond to past and ongoing change by using long-term data on forest composition and structure, soil characteristics, climate, and streamflow. The scientists will continue to add to the long-term data and will complete an experiment to assess the impacts of altering the plant community within the streamside corridor. Findings from this research will guide ecosystem restoration and management by land management agencies and Non-government organizations, and also guide the development of water quality policies at multiple levels of governance. Science findings will be communicated to the local community through the Coweeta Listening Project.

Experimental manipulation, observational studies, and regional modeling will be conducted to understand how this ecosystem is responding to past disturbances, land use change, and ongoing climate change. The manipulative rhododendron removal experiment conducted at plot and stream-reach scales will examine, by subtraction, how forest and riparian ecosystems are altered by the observed spread of the native invasive rhododendron. Continued monitoring of forest demography in long-term plots will build upon >20 years of tree demographic data representing >350,000 tree-year. Coupled with diverse spatially extensive climate and soil data and with data collected collaboratively elsewhere, these records will help examine interactions among competition, site characteristics, management, and past disturbance. While empirical work has documented changes in species distributions through time as functions of diverse and interacting physical, biotic, and anthropic factors, this research will rely on distributed ecosystem modeling to examine temporal and spatial ecosystem dynamics across scales. Ecohydrologic modeling using the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System framework will be used to integrate understanding of fine-scale ecological processes to examine the ecohydrologic and biogeochemical effects of forest change at basin and regional scales."

The research will use interviews and a survey to study land owners and institutional land managers as a basis for a computer simulation of land use decision making that will be linked to a simulation of forest processes, including insect dynamics.  The interacting models will be examined for alternative outcomes in the production of ecosystem services.  The outputs from these models will be integrated into a portfolio of decision support tools designed to help landowners make informed land-use decisions.<br/><br/>The research will examine how climate change and insect infestations affect land-use, and it will quantify the individual, aggregate, and interactive impacts of these processes on forest landscapes. The interacting influences of emerging woody biomass energy markets, insect infestations, and climate change on forest land-use decisions will be addressed. The study will examine (1) whether and how climate change and insect dynamics are shifting land-use regimes in New England by altering human decision-making; (2) how these alterations in human decisions may affect forest ecosystems and the flow of select ecosystem services; and (3) how, in turn, these ecosystem changes affect landowners. To achieve these goals, the researchers will employ a three-faceted approach: (1) social science data collection including surveys, and targeted structured interviews to understand how private landowners in New England perceive climate change and insect and how these perceptions are influencing their land us; (2) agent-based simulations; and (3) regional-scale forest simulations that quantify changes in forest structure, carbon, and species composition. The coupling between the agent-based model representing the human system and the forest simulation representing the natural system will be dynamic in order to capture the specific patterns that emerge from the complex feedbacks between the two. In this framework, the macroscopic properties of complex systems - i.e., land-use regimes - emerge from lower-level interactions among agents. The research also includes a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of the broader impact strategy."

Prior to this breakthrough, many of life's earliest diverging lineages could not be analyzed because they cannot be grown in laboratory cultures. This unculturable ""Microbial Dark Matter"" (MDM) within the groups Bacteria and Archaea constitutes the majority of biological species diversity and biological mass on Earth, and this can now be brought to light by the sequencing of single amplified genomes (SAGs). In this unprecedented research project, many new genomes, encoding the blueprints for disparate organisms, can and will be analyzed to illuminate (1) the genealogy of these ancient microbial species, (2) the relative timing of their origins, and (3) the role that horizontal gene transfer among distant relatives may have played in the origins of new species and novel ways of living. Further, extensive MDM sampling will be done from unexplored subterranean environments around the world, enhancing the discovery and understanding of life forms that are new to science.  <br/><br/>A team of collaborating scientists will analyze over 100 MDM-rich field samples, collected from multiple study sites, including Precambrian shield environments from the Kaapvaall Craton of South Africa, a Precambrian metamorphic complex accessed via the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, and fault-associated springs associated with Tertiary volcanic areas and Cambrian-aged sedimentary rocks of the Death Valley Regional Flow System in Nevada. Extensive contextual information (environmental and biological metadata) will also be incorporated in these sampling efforts. The research tasks begin with the collection of field samples and metadata from sites known or suspected to contain a high proportion of MDM. Then, the microbial community composition within the collected samples is surveyed by sequencing their small sub-unit (SSU) rRNA gene iTags. Based on the iTag data, 20 samples that best meet the objectives of this project are selected, and 12,600 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from them will be sequenced. The SAGs will then be identified by their SSU rRNA genes, and 800 MDM SAGs that best meet the objectives of this project will be further annotated, aligned and combined with various publicly-available data sets for use in detailed, statistical phylogenetic reconstruction of a comprehensive genealogy for Bacteria and Archaea. The genealogical inferences, in combination with other data layers important to understanding MDM evolution (including geochemical, geospatial, microbial community composition, and microbial physiology data) will be compiled and used in addressing the project's general evolutionary questions, as noted above. Analyses will also address the potential for the deep subsurface environments of Earth to serve as a repository for the early evolutionary history of Bacteria and Archaea. This project leverages an existing major award to the researchers through the DOE Joint Genome Institute to cover sequencing costs. The project has a very rich educational and outreach component, geared toward research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and high school teachers. Engaging outreach activities and media designed for the general public are also planned. Further, the laboratory and computational tools and the massive genomic data produced by this project will provide a major resource to the broad research community and, potentially, to the biotechnology industry."

The project will measure changes in key physiological and behavioral traits of individual marmots, and determine their influence on reproduction and survival in this model organism.  This work is important because it will provide new data and insights to better understand the limits of evolutionary responses to environmental change.  The work will continue a long term record of changes in fitness (i.e., reproductive success and survival) for populations of the marmot inhabiting different elevations, and linking this to traits like body mass, aggression, and dominance behavior in these mammals. Continuation of this data provides a valuable window on the effects of climate change on a hibernating mammal, and a priceless data set that can be used to explore both population and evolutionary dynamics.  Broader impacts of this project will include: recruitment and training of graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups; wide dissemination of research results to scientific audiences and the general public via scientific and popular articles and talks, and working with science journalists; and maintenance of a blog and website to provide public information on marmot biology and ecology. <br/><br/>This project will evaluate changes in the environment, in selection pressure, and in trait variance of marmot populations at both low and high elevation sites at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. The work will expand earlier analyses on body mass traits such as mass at emergence, rate of mass gain, and mass before hibernation. Analyses of changes in selection and in trait distributions will be based on the past 40 years and the next 2-3 years. The PI will focus analyses on behavioral and endocrine traits using 12-15 years of data, and use a combination of path analysis to test for causality and the multivariate animal model to decompose trait variance into its environmental and genetic components. By quantifying how selection on traits changes over time, how changes in reproductive success and survival affects traits, and how changes in these traits affect reproduction and survival, this research will integrate proximate and ultimate mechanisms and use novel approaches to study causal inference."

Whether unusual soil ecosystems respond differently to climate change compared to ?normal? soil types is unknown. On the one hand, stress-tolerant plant traits typical of unusual soil flora may result in greater resilience to climate change. On the other hand, spatial isolation and anthropogenic disturbances, like habitat fragmentation, may make unusual soil ecosystems more vulnerable to climate change. This project will use a combination of field measurements, remote sensing, and climate modeling to determine how serpentine soils in the Caribbean region respond to ongoing and predicted climate change. This research represents the first comprehensive effort to understand how tropical serpentine soils respond to climate change, and consequently will vastly improve our understanding of these unique ecosystems. The information generated by this research will be useful for conserving biodiversity and for improving predictions for other unusual soil ecosystems around the world. The data collected during this project will enhance national and global databases, facilitating further research. This project will strengthen the workforce and increase diversity in science by providing training workshops for students and faculty in data management and analytical skills, integrating the data collected in this research into introductory biology teaching modules, and training four undergraduate and four graduate students in all aspects of the study from data collection to publication.<br/><br/>The proposed research will determine scaling relationships between functional trait diversity and environmental attributes of serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems, quantify historical patterns and rates of land-use change of serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems using satellite imagery, and model predicted ecosystem function by integrating soil and functional traits into climate and species distribution models. This project will measure key plant functional traits related to climatic tolerances and dispersal ability in serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems throughout the Caribbean Basin. Soil chemistry will also be quantified, allowing a standardized comparison of soil characteristics across broad spatial scales. Climate and species distribution models will identify regions and species that are particularly vulnerable or resilient to climate change. Inter-annual trends in vegetation greenness and primary production will be analyzed using Landsat imagery data. Remote sensing analyses will determine the magnitude and rate of habitat fragmentation in serpentine and non-serpentine ecosystems and responses to inter-annual variation in precipitation. This project integrates fine-scale patterns of diversity with large-scale patterns of ecosystem change in a global biodiversity hotspot and will determine whether unusual soil ecosystems are uniquely resilient or uniquely vulnerable to climate change."

Currently, however, bark beetle-fungal symbioses are poorly understood resulting in a limited number of strategies to control both the spread and impact of bark beetles in forests worldwide.  This International Research Coordination Network (IRCN) project, co-funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and South African National Research Foundation (NRF), will coordinate the research activities of forest pathologists, entomologists and mycologists throughout South Africa and the U.S. -- two of the world's most productive forest health research communities.  The IRCN will connect 14 institutions, represented by 22 individual researchers, to critically assess how bark beetles and their fungal associates are currently studied and how this research could be improved.  U.S. and South African undergraduates and graduate students will be trained broadly as part of a laboratory exchange program to enhance research coordination between the two countries.  More than half of the project participants are under-represented in science, including females, minorities, and early-career scientists. Natural resource managers and the public will be engaged to help formulate better management strategies based on newly synthesized data among the network members, and information on bark beetle - fungal symbioses will be disseminated broadly via online videos and other media.  <br/><br/>This U.S. - South African IRCN project aims to re-evaluate, invigorate and coordinate research on bark beetle - fungus symbioses.

Although no longer numerous today, brachiopod species were a dominant component of marine ecosystems 540-250 million years ago.  Because of their mineralized shells, brachiopods have a high chance of being preserved as fossils, and have one of the most complete fossil records of any animal group. This project aims to solve a long-standing debate regarding how different brachiopod groups are related to each other and to other animals. Living brachiopods from North America, Croatia, Japan, New Zealand, and several other localities around the world will be sampled for genetic material that will be used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among brachiopods.

This is because, during their nearly 4-billion-year history, microbes have ""invented"" numerous metabolic reactions that have transformed the Earth's environment.  To understand these processes, their impacts on the ecosystem, and to harness them for societal benefits requires a multidisciplinary approach.  Microbial Diversity is an advanced research training program at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) that augments traditional PhD and postdoctoral training through an intensive 6.5 week, immersive experience that occurs in the peak summer months when prominent scientists across biological disciplines convene at MBL. This research-training program teaches cutting-edge methods and concepts that impact microbial ecology, ecosystem function and animal-associated microbiomes.  To accomplish these goals, participants will receive broad research training at the forefront of microbiological sciences, research ethics and scientific outreach to the public.  This experience has broad impacts for the following reasons: 1) The transformative nature of the program enhances retention in research and academic positions; 2) Mentoring postdoctoral trainees in curriculum development provides valuable teaching experience; 3) Participants from underrepresented groups in science will contribute towards the diversification of the scientific workforce.   Research products that will emerge from the course include publicly-available resources and cultured isolates of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Many students from this research-training program go on to be leaders in research that incorporates microbial biodiversity, and in at the intersection of science and society.  <br/> <br/>This research-training experience integrates training across biological scales; from understanding one metabolic pathway in a single organism, to dynamics of single cells in a population, to understanding the impact of microbes on the ecosystem scale.  The goal of this program is to integrate training from the disciplines of microbiology, ecology, evolution, chemistry, computational science, and bioinformatics in order to shape the future leaders of microbial diversity science. This is accomplished by integrating modeling, experimentation, and function with emerging cellular properties across broad spatio-temporal scales in order to be able to predict the behavior of living cells in natural systems. In the next three years, specific training will be offered in: (i) cultivation that leverages information from the vast, publicly-available sequence databases, with a focus on novel eukaryotes, viruses, and microbial consortia, (ii) isolating and characterizing the role of viruses in microbial diversity, function and ecology; (iii) quantitative tools and modeling of high-resolution changes of metabolic fluxes in time and space.  The objectives of this research-training experience are as follows: (i) Participants will receive broad research training in transformative theoretical and applied approaches at the forefront of microbiological sciences, through a combination of classroom, workshop, and laboratory-based didactic activities; (ii) Intensive and ongoing longitudinal explorations of marine, freshwater and host-associated microbial communities will be integrated to identify microbial dynamics over a five-year time series of publicly available data, and (iii) Postdoctoral researchers will receive direct experience in active learning in the classroom and laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sticklebacks have long been a critical model system in evolutionary biology, and are known for their complex mating behavior and diversity among populations in terms of morphology and life-history. This collection, which was assembled since 1975, represents extensive phenotypic diversity in stickleback fish, and therefore this data-source is crucial for current and future comparative or experimental research on sticklebacks in particular, and evolutionary and behavioral processes in general. Of particular value are the fossil samples, as they are central to gain a better understanding of the timing of evolutionary dynamics, including trends in trait relationships and their role in shaping stickleback diversity.  This project will make this collection accessible to researchers nationally, and internationally. It will provide important training and research opportunities in basic and applied sciences (e.g., Department of Fish and Wildlife).<br/><br/>The fossil specimens will be deposited in the University of California Museum of Paleontology; the extant specimens will be deposited in the Ichthyology Collection of the California Academy of Sciences. The samples and associated records will be indexed and linked to field notes and associated databases will be assigned museum specimen numbers. Curating and depositing these specimens will make them available to the general science community. The preservation of this research collection will ensure the continued use of this valuable resource, and preparation of sample records will involve high-throughput scanning, accuracy-editing of labels, curation of microstratigraphic data as well as map coordinate data. Sample records will be linked to an existing limnological database, as well as the Alaska Department of Fish and Game records for the Alaskan samples."

They will further explore how interactions among size classes (e.g., cannibalism and competition) influence the development of size structure. Salamanders are the predators in the study. This project will provide exceptional opportunities for undergraduate students to learn the scientific method through the development and execution of independent research projects. It will significantly build research capacity among three undergraduate institutions in Kentucky, one of which is a minority-serving institution. Students will gain first-hand experience in designing and implementing experiments, in analyzing and managing data, and in communicating science to diverse public audiences. Each of these institutions lacks independent resources and programs to engage students in research. This project serves the Nation's interests by providing resources needed to train students in complex problem solving through rigorous experimental design.<br/><br/>Previous research suggests that size structure of top predators can significantly influence trophic interactions, and may explain observed variation in the strength of trophic cascades, yet few empirical studies have focused on these questions. This project will combine experiments and field studies to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of predator size structure, density, and cannibalism, the resulting community dynamics, and the demographic feedback mechanisms thought to generate variation in size structure. Predators that vary in size can exhibit both consumptive effects, through cannibalism, and non-consumptive effects on the survival of their offspring. They also influence the abundance of other predators and competitors. When taken together, these diverse effects could modify entire food webs, ultimately altering the size structure of future predator populations and thus future trophic cascades. Undergraduate students will work in teams to test the diverse mechanisms proposed to generate variation in size structure using a series of mesocosm experiments and field studies. Experiments and field observations will quantify the impact of predator size structure on trophic cascades and determine how demographic feedbacks affect annual variation in predator size structure. Results will provide new insight into how the loss or recovery of top predators can affect ecosystems, with implications for conservation and management. Students will participate in science education activities to engage undergraduate non-science majors and K-12 students and contribute to an interactive learning module to extend the impacts of this project to students and citizens throughout the nation and globe.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research."

Scientists conduct this work across multiple time scales: investigating the present, looking back thousands of years, and using that knowledge to calculate future change. Over the next six years, research will integrate the site's site-to-regional-scale strengths in research, education, and outreach to understand the interactive effects of climate change, biological processes, and human land-use on ecosystem dynamics, processes, and the services they provide to humans and wildlife. Researchers will pursue this question by applying long-term data from new and ongoing experiments to integrated scenarios analyses, which are a framework for scientists and decision-makers to work together to determine what factors influence present and future landscape change. These factors will then be incorporated into models to link a range of potential future scenarios, such as a future with limited oil resources, with a range of potential consequences for forest dynamics and ecosystem processes, such as an increase in forest cutting to produce heat and energy formerly produced by oil.<br/><br/>To broaden the impacts of its research programs, the Harvard Forest project is committed to strong education and outreach programs that engage K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as land managers, elected decision-makers, and the news media, to produce and to understand societally-relevant ecological data. This research is part of a national-scale effort led by the Harvard Forest to incorporate regional land-use scenarios at all LTER sites. The inclusion of decision-makers in the production of the results, and public outreach of those results, fills critical knowledge gaps for scientists and the public, and helps decision-makers better use science to address societally-relevant questions."

By comparing gene regulation among these populations, they will learn how gene regulation changes as organisms adapt to their environment. The project will provide an unusually complete view of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the evolution of gene regulation. It will also inform how insects adapt to novel environments.

The project includes the collection of RNA sequence data from three pairs of warm- and cold-adapted populations that encompass these three climate transitions.  By applying a population genetic framework to this data set, population differences in gene expression and alternative splicing that were most likely driven by local adaptation can be identified.  Crosses between warm- and cold-adapted populations will allow these changes to be classified as either cis-encoded at the affected gene, or trans-encoded by another gene.  For cis-encoded cases of adaptive expression or splicing evolution, patterns of genetic variation can illuminate key details of natural selection's mode of action. Researchers will use existing population genomic data to test whether selection favored new mutations or standing genetic variation.  The project also entails the genetic mapping of cold tolerance differences for each population pair.  The combination of mapping results, population genomic analysis of existing data, and the above RNA sequencing results will identify notable candidate genes for local adaptation via cis-acting changes in gene regulation.

Key challenges are to understand how these issues are related and to identify strategies for reducing their effects on human and wildlife populations. For instance, growing evidence suggests that the diversity of organisms found in natural habitats can affect how fast pathogens spread, including those that cause illness in humans. This research will investigate how changes in species diversity affect the risk of infection and disease in a threatened group of wildlife: amphibians. Researchers from the USA and the United Kingdom will work together to better understand how diversity influences pathogen transmission, using mechanistic models of infection fit to data from field observations, laboratory experiments, and whole-system manipulations. Results of the research will be used to assist natural resource managers to conserve threatened amphibian populations and to develop an interactive exhibit at the University of Colorado Natural History Museum which will engage elementary and middle school students. The project will also provide opportunities for broadening participation in science by involving undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This proposal applies tools and concepts from community ecology to test the foundational relationships between biological diversity and parasite infection. Building upon extensive previous research by the investigators, data from (i) wetland surveys will be used to understand how communities of amphibians (frogs, toads, and salamanders) and infectious parasites change along a gradient in biodiversity. Field data will be combined with results from (ii) laboratory experiments that test alternative mechanisms through which biodiversity might affect infections to develop (iii) predictive models that forecast the influence of each mechanism on disease risk. Finally, model predictions will be tested and refined using a (iv) real-world experiment in which the presence and abundance of an influential host species is altered across a natural richness gradient. Results will be compared among parasite species that differ in the amount of disease they cause in amphibian hosts. The integration of wetland surveys, multi-scale experiments, and predictive modeling will fill a key knowledge gap by assessing the functional relationships between biodiversity and parasite transmission, which are difficult to discern from strictly observational data or studies of a single host or parasite species. These efforts will help resolve ongoing debates about the diversity-disease relationship and build a more comprehensive understanding of how changes in ecological communities interact to influence disease risk.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

So far, however, the individual experiments have been analyzed separately. A comprehensive evaluation of the full set of experiments is needed to determine the role of terrestrial organic matter in food web patterns and the response of food webs to harvest, stocking and nutrient enrichment. More specifically, existing data from whole lake experiments will be used to investigate: (1) the interactive effects of nutrients, terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), and consumer assimilation of terrestrial organic matter (allochthony) on the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton and the capacity of large-bodied grazers to withstand predation, (2) the effects of terrestrial prey on the stability and resilience of lake food webs and the strength of trophic cascades, and (3) the regulation of whole-ecosystem respiration by nutrients, terrestrial DOM, and food web structure.

Some tropical places are called ""hotspots"" because their local biodiversity greatly exceeds the biodiversity of other regions with similar climates. Madagascar is such a special place, with a tremendous number of species occurring only on this island, distributed within very small geographic areas. Part of the explanation of Madagascar's rich biodiversity is geographic isolation: long isolation from other landmasses has produced unique species across an island with high topographical and ecological diversity. But why do so many of Madagascar's unique species seem to occupy the same ecological role and yet occur side by side? This research will use ant diversity information from Madagascar to understand the processes that drive distribution patterns and organize insect communities. The results will provide insights into how species diversity patterns evolve, enabling us to both decipher the past and allow us to adapt to the future and respond to threats such as deforestation and habitat loss. This scientific study is accompanied by an extensive education plan integrating undergraduate students into a field research and outreach program to raise awareness on forest conservation issues both in Madagascar and the United States, and teach the skills necessary to monitor and conserve forests.<br/><br/>To investigate community structure and diversity patterns, as well as potential drivers of community assembly and species endemism, this study will utilize new phylogenomic tools and an unparalleled ecological data set for ants in Madagascar based on field inventories and collections conducted across the region by the researchers over the last 20 years. The objectives are to: (1) Assemble a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly 1,300 species of Malagasy ants. (2) Combine over 100,000 curated specimen records with climatic niche data to model species distributions for all Malagasy ants at 260 study sites. (3) Analyze and characterize patterns of ant community structure and diversity in Madagascar based on these genetic lineage and community data sets. In particular, the vertical stratification of ant communities in the canopy and leaf litter, as well as diversity along elevational gradients, will be examined. This large-scale community analysis aims to understand factors important in generating and maintaining species distribution patterns and endemism, and will allow us to draw widely applicable conclusions about the role of these patterns in community assembly. Beyond expanding the boundaries of scientific discovery, this research will (4) communicate arthropod, rainforest, and canopy biodiversity by educating public and scientific audiences through internships, workshops, video exhibits, and talks, and create extensive training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity.  As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function.  Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell.  However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 ""representative"" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity."

This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity.  As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function.  Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell.  However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya).

Some tropical places are called ""hotspots"" because their local biodiversity greatly exceeds the biodiversity of other regions with similar climates. Madagascar is such a special place, with a tremendous number of species occurring only on this island, distributed within very small geographic areas. Part of the explanation of Madagascar's rich biodiversity is geographic isolation: long isolation from other landmasses has produced unique species across an island with high topographical and ecological diversity. But why do so many of Madagascar's unique species seem to occupy the same ecological role and yet occur side by side? This research will use ant diversity information from Madagascar to understand the processes that drive distribution patterns and organize insect communities. The results will provide insights into how species diversity patterns evolve, enabling us to both decipher the past and allow us to adapt to the future and respond to threats such as deforestation and habitat loss. This scientific study is accompanied by an extensive education plan integrating undergraduate students into a field research and outreach program to raise awareness on forest conservation issues both in Madagascar and the United States, and teach the skills necessary to monitor and conserve forests.<br/><br/>To investigate community structure and diversity patterns, as well as potential drivers of community assembly and species endemism, this study will utilize new phylogenomic tools and an unparalleled ecological data set for ants in Madagascar based on field inventories and collections conducted across the region by the researchers over the last 20 years. The objectives are to: (1) Assemble a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly 1,300 species of Malagasy ants. (2) Combine over 100,000 curated specimen records with climatic niche data to model species distributions for all Malagasy ants at 260 study sites. (3) Analyze and characterize patterns of ant community structure and diversity in Madagascar based on these genetic lineage and community data sets. In particular, the vertical stratification of ant communities in the canopy and leaf litter, as well as diversity along elevational gradients, will be examined. This large-scale community analysis aims to understand factors important in generating and maintaining species distribution patterns and endemism, and will allow us to draw widely applicable conclusions about the role of these patterns in community assembly. Beyond expanding the boundaries of scientific discovery, this research will (4) communicate arthropod, rainforest, and canopy biodiversity by educating public and scientific audiences through internships, workshops, video exhibits, and talks, and create extensive training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.

The project will initiate short-term experiments to identify mechanisms that causally link climatic factors to observed patterns of abundance and distribution across habitats.  These will evaluate top-down effects of climate on predators, bottom-up climate effects through a facilitative interaction involving a second herbivore species, and the effects of flooding and litter accumulation on caterpillar vital rates.

Drought and wildfire caused by changing precipitation patterns, increased temperatures, increased fuel loads, and decades of fire suppression are reducing forest carbon uptake from local to continental scales.  This trend is especially widespread in Idaho and the intermountain west and has important implications for climate change and forest management options. Given the key role of forests in climate regulation, understanding forest responses to disturbance and the feedbacks to the atmosphere is a key research and policy-relevant priority in the U.S. and elsewhere. As temperature, fire, and precipitation regimes continue to change and influence forest mortality, there is a growing potential role for drought and fire mitigation efforts such as forest thinning. This research will evaluate the climate impacts of restoration thinning, a forest management activity aimed at reducing drought- and fire-related mortality, by combining new experimental plot data and earth system modeling.  This project has three main goals: 1) quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of thinning on net regional greenhouse gas emissions and climate, 2) evaluate the impact of thinning on forest resilience to drought and disturbance, and 3) contribute to education of students and teachers about the role of forests in climate regulation.<br/><br/>By integrating novel, field-based technology, existing datasets, and state-of-the-art earth system modeling, this research will yield scientific insights into both climatic and management controls on tree growth as well as forest-atmosphere gas exchange in the mixed conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains in Idaho. The project objectives will advance the current understanding of how disturbance impacts forest carbon, water, and energy balance at time steps from minutes to years, which is crucial for earth system model development and evaluation. Improved earth system modeling and existing long-term ecological research data will be used to make predictions of forest-atmosphere interactions for the intermountain west over the 21st century. This will improve policy-relevant understanding of forest management practices and forest climate regulation. Additionally, this project will contribute to science education. Students and educators will be actively engaged in climate and forest science research through collection and sharing of data and will learn how forests capture and release carbon dioxide, and how these processes influence climate."

At the same time, the project will contribute data to generate a more robust phylogenetic framework for investigating the evolutionary relationships of specific groups of Cactaceae, as well as measuring rates of molecular evolution and mutation across the family. Reconstructing the history of gene losses and genome reconfigurations in this family of photosynthetic plants offers a system for studying genome variation and evolution under the selective pressures of life in the desert environment."

Many species of plants and animals can be threatened by rapid environmental change, such as an increase in frequency or severity of drought. This research will test the conditions required for a population to avoid collapse due to climate change through a process of adapting to the new environmental conditions. It will add to the longest-running data set on how selection in plants changes in response to changes in annual snowpack and pollinator availability, and to model for the first time how adaptation to these conditions allows populations to recover. It will determine how selective pressures change in response to water availability, how genetic variation in leaf and flower traits interact with climate change to affect birth and death rates, and how changes in pollination patterns and rates interact with the physical environment to influence evolutionary change. Responses of population size to climate change will be projected over the next century and provide a case study of how other species might respond. The project will include the training of diverse undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral associate. Field science tours at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory will be led for outreach to the general public and to K-12 teachers. In addition, a citizen science project will allow the public to contribute to the building of maps of pollinator abundance across the western US.<br/><br/>This project will continue a 10-year field experiment with common gardens near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory to measure natural selection on, and the extent of genetic variance in, traits of Ipomopsis aggregata subspp. aggregata and Ipomopsis tenuituba (Polemoniaceae). In combination with unique data on how absolute fitness is altered by snowmelt date, models for evolutionary rescue will be fully parameterized in nature. The relationship between selection of functional vegetative traits and water availability will be determined with two approaches: observational data on selection over two decades and a new experimental manipulation of snowmelt date and summer precipitation. The project will examine the dependence of evolutionary and demographic responses on genetic variance in traits, as measured from a full-sib breeding design. The extent of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to annual snowmelt date will also be incorporated into projections of population size. Although prior studies of plant adaptation to climate have emphasized vegetative traits, floral traits (shape, color, rewards, volatiles) will be modeled as well, as selection on them depends on water availability and pollinator abundance."

Today, frequent fires are important for maintaining grasslands and savannas, which cover 40% of the surface of the Earth. Savannas are dynamic mixtures of trees and grass that are controlled by both fire and drought. It remains a mystery, however, exactly how the balance between trees and grasses is maintained over centuries or millennia. Furthermore, it is unclear how savanna ecosystems are likely to change over the long term and how changes may affect important ecological processes like carbon storage and nutrient cycling. This research will combine knowledge from a fire experiment begun in 1964, tree-ring records extending decades into the past, and a sediment core from a lake to understand how changes in drought and fire affect the oak savanna over time scales ranging from years to centuries. This research will provide both the first fire history of the oak savanna in the upper Midwestern U.S. and one of the only long-term nutrient records for this region. The resulting analyses will also provide information to managers in the Tallgrass Prairie and Oak Savanna Fire Science Consortium who need more information regarding long-term fire regimes and historical fire patterns to forecast future responses to environmental change. Many research products will be provided in open-access journals. The topic of savannas and fire will be shared with the public through the development of a video with the popular MinuteEarth Channel.<br/><br/>This research will integrate new paleoecological data with data from several decades of ecological experiments at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, a long-term research site in Minnesota, USA. These experiments, which are situated in a temperate oak savanna, suggest that increased fire frequency reduces the quantity of nitrogen and slows down its cycling both because of fire-induced nitrogen losses and because of a vegetation shift from an oak-dominated woodland to a grassland. Across a burn frequency gradient, soil samples below grass and trees will be measured for carbon, N concentration and isotopic composition. Tree-ring sampling of several species along the gradient will be used to develop new ring-width chronologies and stand age structures with precise dating and seasonal resolution. These chronologies will be used to assess growth response to N cycling changes, past drought episodes, and fire frequency. A Holocene-age sediment core from Cedar Bog Lake will be analyzed to assess fire history, past oak:grass dynamics, and N cycling metrics. With this novel combination of tree-ring data, lacustrine sediment measurements and information from a 53-year controlled burn experiment, researchers will address three research questions: (1) How have humans and climate influenced fire regime for the most recent 300 years compared with climate influences earlier in the Holocene? (2) How have fire and climate in turn interacted to influence oak dominance in mixed oak-grass vegetation? (3) How do changes in oak vs. grass dominance alter nitrogen cycling in the context of long-term changes in climate and fire frequency?"

Yet, more than 95% of the N in soil exists in organic forms, primarily enzymes and other proteins that originated from decaying plant material or from the microorganisms that decompose it. This research will study protein breakdown in forest soil, which is the major bottleneck in converting organic N into forms available to plants. Proteins are broken down by enzymes (proteases) that are produced and released into the soil environment by bacteria and fungi. Interactions between proteins and soil-mineral and organic components can affect the activity of microbial proteases. This research will directly measure microbial and soil controls on protein degradation and thus provide a deeper understanding of the bottleneck in the supply of N to plants and other environmental fates of N. This research has the potential to be transformative in that it will reveal a core mechanism coupling carbon (C) and N cycling. Understanding how proteases de-polymerize and recycle organic N is needed to more accurately  model how limited natural nitrogen availability affects interactions between C & N cycles. Research will be conveyed to groups underrepresented in science through four activities that extend beyond the laboratory: (1) the annual HJA Day at the Andrews Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, which reaches large numbers of the general public; (2) assist in a short-course in soil science that is taught each summer for middle and high school teachers; (3) provide a K-12 teacher with research experience; and (4) design  curriculum and teach a short-course in environmental proteomics for graduate students.<br/><br/>Organic N turnover has long been recognized as key controller of N availability in soil ecosystems, but the processes that break down macromolecular N compounds into assimilable N-monomers have received little attention. The proposed research will examine the turnover of organic N, particularly proteins, which make up the greatest fraction of soil organic N. A new conceptual approach towards the soil N cycle is proposed that recognizes ""matrix"" and ""microbial"" controls on the bioavailability of organic N: Interacting chemical and physical processes associated with the soil matrix control the accessibility of proteinaceous N to a diverse complement of proteases produced by a complex microbial community in response to environmental stimuli. This model will be explored through two objectives: (1) determining the fate of two 15N-labeled 'substrate' proteins with distinct physicochemical characteristics in soils across a gradient of resource availability, mineralogy, and microbial ecology, with special emphasis on the relative importance of protein-mineral and protein-organic matter interactions as contributors to matrix regulation; (2) determining the relative contributions of different microbial groups to protease activity in soils that vary in N availability, and the control of protease activity by C versus N limitation as a means of exploring the microbial regulation of protein turnover. Research questions associated with these objectives will be addressed using soils of well-characterized, long-standing experiments in temperate forests. 15N-labeled proteins will be used to determine their turnover rates and the fate of the C and N in the proteins. This will be coupled with characterization of proteases and measurements of their activities. A manipulative experiment will be done to determine the relative contribution to protease activity by bacteria and fungi. These data will provide insight into the control mechanisms functioning in our conceptual model of organic N turnover. Collectively, data generated in Objectives 1 and 2 will allow us to identify the mechanistic functions that the soil matrix and microbial community exert on the fate of protein N as it is degraded in soils. It will reveal how the activities of microbial proteases vary among soil ecosystems and characterize them by their catalytic types. Knowing the properties and behavior of proteases is essential to reconcile how they access the different forms of soil-associated proteins, and thus constitutes a fundamental prerequisite for successful future studies. To this end, the proposed research will generate quantitative information of N transformation and retention in soil, which is also critical to the management of soil productivity and environmental health. The data and functional relationships generated by the proposed research are eventually intended to be coupled to N cycling models that separate the activity of microbial functional groups or enzymes. The outcomes of this research will include a more quantitative understanding of the role of microbial proteases in organic N cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and of the sources and diversity of proteases."

One of the reasons invasive shrubs may impact native ecosystems so greatly is that they have an extended period with leaves, as compared to native woody species, also called extended leaf phenology (ELP). Phenology is the timing of biological phenomena that correspond to climatic conditions. This earlier leaf emergence in the spring and/or later leaf fall in the autumn creates shade at unique times of the year. So far, studies comparing ELP of invasive compared to native shrubs have been done at single locations. However, we know that cues that drive leaf phenology, for example temperature, vary greatly from region to region and from year to year. So, when we compare regions across the eastern U.S., will we find differences in leaf phenology between native and invasive shrubs? Are there regions where it is important to focus management efforts because ELP of invading shrubs  is greater? How will leaf phenology change with temperature changes? To address these questions, researchers have developed a citizen science campaign called ""Shady Invaders"" to collect leaf phenology observations across the eastern U.S. Through participant training and eNewsletter and webinar updates, both the public and scientific research are enriched from this collaboration. <br/><br/><br/>Species-specific leaf phenology data are impossible to collect simultaneously across a regional scale without numerous observers. Fortunately, data collection is straightforward, allowing the growing efforts of citizen scientists to be applied to this problem. Regional citizen science phenology observations for native and invasive shrubs will provide insight into the spatial extent and consistency of the novel leaf phenology of invasive shrubs across eastern U.S. and will contribute to our understanding of the broader applicability of local-scale research on this topic. The landscape-scale, multi-year approach can be used to predict the potential implications of climate change for leaf phenology by developing a predictive model for phenology. Through collaboration with researchers from China, phenology data are being incorporated from the native range of the shrub species invading forests of eastern U.S. to understand whether novel phenology arose as a product of evolutionary pressures in the native range (pre-adaptation), or more recently in the introduced range (rapid adaptation with range expansion). This will contribute to pressing research questions as well as informing whether leaf phenology is a useful tool for predicting and preventing future invasions."

Zoonoses are a major threat to biosecurity and public health. Bats are home to some of the highest-profile emerging zoonoses, including Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, and Hendra viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Transmission from bats to humans often occurs when bats abandon natural habitats to take advantage of resources associated with human settlements. This project will investigate how habitat loss causes bat migration into populated developed areas, which leads to increased bat-human encounters and increased disease transmission. The research will focus on Hendra virus, a bat borne pathogen in Australia, to study the interactions among changing landscapes, loss of natural habitats, humans, bats, and pathogens. A surge of bat movement into towns and cities in eastern Australia has led to increased negative bat-human interactions, and increased mortality of horses and humans from Hendra virus. An ultimate goal of the research is to identify and mitigate the specific interacting factors responsible for increased disease incidence and poor health outcomes. The research team includes investigators at ten academic institutions and a non-profit organization. The project will train U.S. students and postdoctoral researchers, improve science communication and policies that protect wildlife and human health, and will build greater research capacity among national and international collaborators. Methods and results will be generalizable to numerous countries in which similar zoonotic events occur, but that have limited resources for biological surveillance, disease prevention, and responding to outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypotheses that the root cause of negative bat-human interactions is the loss of habitat needed to sustain bats' nomadic feeding ecology, and that some management decisions (e.g., destruction of roost sites, not vaccinating horses) may exacerbate conflict, spillover, and habitat loss. The research integrates theory and field data spanning ecology, physiology, epidemiology, political science, anthropology, veterinary medicine, behavioral ecology, and mathematical modeling. Data will be collected on land-use change and the physiology, energetics, and movement of bats; mechanistic models will be used to examine how the relations among these variables influence bats' use of urban areas. The researchers will conduct field and modeling studies on the dynamics of bat viruses to help predict future instances of virus spillover. They will additionally use narratives, collaboratively produced by researchers and local communities, to conduct experiments on risk perceptions and decisions about bat nuisance, virus spillover, and vaccination. Ultimately, the project will lead to an evidence-based program for reversing the negative human-wildlife interactions that lead to epidemics and loss of wildlife. It will also lead to a framework for public education and engagement that is endorsed by local communities and is embedded in ecological restoration initiatives."

Research showing large-scale declines of plants and pollinators highlights the concern that pollination services are at risk; the problem arises in part because plant habitat is increasingly fragmented into unconnected patches that pollinators may not be able to reach. However, the pollinators and their plants are interrelated in a network of shared plant species and pollinators and so the functions of hosts and pollinator have redundancy. Fragmentation and loss of native habitats is associated with pollinator declines, but according to theoretical models, the structure of pollination networks is expected to make them generally resilient to change because of the redundancy. However, if plant species that are depended upon by many pollinator species (i.e., ""keystone species"") are lost, pollination webs may be more vulnerable, resulting in sudden network collapse. This research will address two overarching questions: (1) What are the consequences of keystone plant decline and extinction to the broader pollination network? (2) Can landscape connectivity and consequent greater pollinator movement across patches buffer pollination networks against network collapse? The research itself promotes the progress of science and has implications for national welfare given its potential contributions to the maintenance of pollinator species diversity.  Additionally, this work will continue to capitalize on the charisma and diversity of tropical hummingbirds to transmit ideas about the importance of the conservation of pollination services. <br/><br/>Previous NSF-funded work has shown that the movement of hummingbird pollinators is strongly restricted by landscape fragmentation, which results in pollen limitation and subsequent regeneration failure in a common keystone forest herb (Heliconia tortuosa). Under the network collapse hypothesis, reduced H. tortuosa densities will limit nectar resource availability thereby decreasing pollinator visitation to fragments and resulting in eventual network collapse. In this instance, landscape connectivity will decrease the minimum number Heliconia required to maintain network structure. Under the robust network hypothesis, the behavioral plasticity of pollinators will confer resistance to the network, even if some plant and hub pollinators are missing or at low abundance. H. tortuosa will be removed from isolated and connected forest fragments to determine whether altered densities of this species affects (a) hummingbird movement, (b) plant reproduction and genetic diversity, and (c) the structure of the pollination network.  Hummingbird movement will be quantified for all species in the network using Radio-Frequency Identification Devices (RFID). This method will enable observations of the entire hummingbird pollinator community at an unprecedented temporal resolution (seconds) and spatial scale. Broader impacts will include educational and outreach efforts that include substantial media coverage; international citizen science; educational games and student-driven data collection that meet Next Generation Science Standards; and public education efforts."

This project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, two Ph.D. students, and approximately 15 undergraduate students, as well as facilitating collaborations and providing training to a diverse group of scientists from across the globe. Project participants will also be designing and leading hybrid courses between Northern Arizona University and Namibia's renowned Gobabeb Research Center, and working to enhance research collections in all participating institutions. <br/><br/>This project will resolve centuries-old issues in our understanding of desert darkling beetles by 1) generating DNA data from recently collected and museum specimens using high-throughput sequencing and target enrichment methods to recover ~631 genetic loci for approximately 500 species across the Pimeliinae. Additionally, approximately 300 larval and adult morphological characters will be scored for each species. Morphological data will be combined with the molecular data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the subfamily.

Changes in tropical forest productivity in response to drought are an important feedback in the carbon cycle; yet, we currently have a very incomplete understanding of how biomass, productivity, and species composition of these forests respond to changes in temperature and water availability.  This project will take a new approach to understanding tropical forest drought responses by focusing on the relationships between plant functional traits, metabolic scaling theory, and climate drivers.  Functional traits are easily measureable metrics that allow us to better predict plant growth, reproduction, and forest change.  Metabolic scaling theory describes the relationships between the size of an organism, its growth rate, and temperature.  This project will attempt to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical ecosystems respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. Researchers will use scaling theory to provide a predictive framework that links forest responses to drought with well understood plant traits measured using novel ground and remote sensing technology.  <br/><br/>This project will assess changes in productivity in response to drought, as well as tree mortality and forest dieback.  This will be accomplished using both field measurements as well as pre-existing LIDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing data from forests across an elevation gradient in the Peruvian Amazon.  Specifically, researchers will use a suite of plant functional traits to provide detailed, 3D maps of forest canopy structure and the spatial distribution of traits.  The novel scaling theory developed with these data (Trait Driver Theory, TDT) will then be used to predict ecosystem function from changes in trait distributions over time in response to drought.  The project will also involve a field experiment to simulate drought with throughfall collectors to help parameterize TDT model functions.  The TDT results will also be compared to predictions from the ecosystem demography model ED2.  Model code, images, and algorithms will be made available in public repositories, and any new plant functional trait data will be added to global databases.

This project uses thousands of botanical specimens in museums across 16 states to understand the reasons why certain plants advance the timing of their life events more than others and to predict how plants will respond in the future. This work is broadly applicable to agricultural systems and the management of natural areas. As part of this effort, thousands of citizen-scientists will be engaged in the science of environmental change.

These hypotheses have largely remained untested, because comprehensive evolutionary trees are unavailable. Assassin bugs include beneficial species used to control plant pests, pollinator predators, and powerful human disease vectors that transmit the causative agent of Chagas disease. An international team led by researchers at the University of California, Riverside will investigate the evolutionary history of assassin bugs, tying together extensive genetic and morphological data with innovative approaches to gather natural history data.

This project will: 1) test phylogenetic hypotheses with emphasis on the poorly resolved Higher Reduviidae and contentious relationships of the hematophagous Chagas disease vectors Triatominae, while maximizing taxonomic coverage and integrating transcriptomic, anchored hybrid enrichment, traditional molecular, and morphological datasets; 2) describe and redescribe fossil reduvioids to bridge taxonomic and geological gaps in the fossil record and test hypotheses on the timing of key biological events; 3) apply metabarcoding approaches to assassin bug gut contents to complement available prey data; 4) study diversification across Reduvioidea, focusing on hypotheses of diversification rate shifts and correlated key innovations, and morphological, physiological, and ecological traits involved in the transition between predation and blood-feeding; 5) use the phylogenetic information generated during this project to propose a new classification of Reduvioidea."

These shaping forces alter the functional genetic capabilities required for competitive success within riverine microbial communities, and, thus, drive shifts in functional gene expression and phylogenetic composition, that, in turn, increase the efficiency of DOM metabolism and biogeochemical processes. Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) the functional genetic composition and gene expression patterns of riverine microbial communities are correlated with the composition of riverine DOM; (2) community gene expression patterns vary predictably in response to shifts in the available forms of DOM; and, (3) the composition of riverine bacterial communities correlates with the composition of riverine DOM over space and time, and varies with watershed-specific climatic factors. The first hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbial community gene content (metagenomics), gene expression (metatranscriptomics), and DOM diversity (high-resolution analytical chemistry) during four seasons in five rivers that encompass a broad range of DOM composition.

Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) the functional genetic composition and gene expression patterns of riverine microbial communities are correlated with the composition of riverine DOM; (2) community gene expression patterns vary predictably in response to shifts in the available forms of DOM; and, (3) the composition of riverine bacterial communities correlates with the composition of riverine DOM over space and time, and varies with watershed-specific climatic factors. The first hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbial community gene content (metagenomics), gene expression (metatranscriptomics), and DOM diversity (high-resolution analytical chemistry) during four seasons in five rivers that encompass a broad range of DOM composition. The second hypothesis will be addressed with an experimental study to identify active organisms and genes expressed by freshwater microbial metabolism. The third hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbes, DOM, and river chemistry in 36 major U.S. rivers.

Termites are also ecologically important because they digest one of the most abundant macromolecules on land, cellulose. Termites are social insects that eat plants, from grasses to hard wood. But they cannot digest this diet, rich in cellulose, without small organisms that live in their gut known as endosymbionts.  The diet of termites varies among species, and so too does the type of endosymbiont found in their gut. It is possible that termites have changed diets and changed endosymbionts multiple times during their evolution. This project uses genetic, behavioral, diet, and morphological (appearance) traits to understand termite evolution. In addition, this research will focus on mentoring, recruiting and retaining students from underprivileged or underrepresented groups in science. This goal will be reached using an academic pipeline extending from Newark High Schools to undergraduate study at Rutgers University and ultimately to graduate research. Students from Newark high schools will be trained in fieldwork and the scientific method via Aim High, an existing program through Rutgers University, increasing recruitment of underprivileged students to post-secondary education. Undergraduate and graduate students will gain teaching experience through Aim High, while also being trained in laboratory and fieldwork.<br/><br/>This project will test large,comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses of Termitoidea and their endosymbionts with a thorough, global taxon sample. Phylogenetic reconstructions will be based on both molecular and morphological data, and will be analyzed for co-evolutionary patterns. Divergence estimation analyses, biogeographical analyses and ancestral-state reconstruction will allow us to evaluate the timing of shifts in functional and phylogenetic diversity globally. Diversification rate shifts in the lower termites will be estimated, and evaluated in the context of diet, behavior and morphological adaptations. This work will be used to address the question of which came first for termite evolution, shifts in diet or shifts in the endosymbiont microbes living in their guts? It further examines how these changes drove the evolution of termite social behavior? By using knowledge of relationships in testing for the correlation of ecological roles and endosymbiont diversity with termite morphology and diet, researchers can determine what aspects of termite life history led to the formation of new species."

They evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and represent one of the oldest fungal groups, yet their evolutionary history is unclear. Specifically, the exact relationship between anaerobic fungi and other fungal groups, as well as the timing and sequence of events that lead to their localization to a gut habitat, remains unclear. Further, it is not exactly known how the gut habitat has affected their genomes and evolution. This project will tackle these questions by sequencing the genomes of a large, diverse collection of anaerobic gut fungi, and analyzing the data produced using a wide range of computational procedures. The proposed efforts will lead to significant advances in the understanding of the history of this peculiar group of fungi and factors driving their evolution. Further, the data obtained would be of extreme interest to a broader group of scientists working in the areas of biofuel research, animal nutrition, and molecular biology of fungi.  The project will engage multiple high school and undergraduate students in research, with special effort to engage minority (especially Native American) students to advance the participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, and math disciplines. <br/> <br/>Overall research progress on anaerobic fungi has been slow, and sequencing of anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) genomes has been hampered by their extremely high adenine-thymine content and the proliferation of intergenic repeats in their genomes. This project will utilize a new approach that combines multiple sequencing technologies to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of a large and diverse collection of anaerobic fungal isolates. This research will utilize the data generated to conduct an extensive phylogenomic analysis, aiming to resolve their evolutionary history within the fungal tree of life, correlate the timing of AGF diversification events to the evolution of their herbivorous hosts, resolve the diversification pattern of anaerobic fungal genera, and investigate the impact of the unique habitat and evolutionary trajectory on their genomic architecture."

Ecologists have suggested that the reason for this pattern is that higher levels of food resources for life are found in the tropics.  This project will perform a direct test of that hypothesis by making measurements of biodiversity and food resource levels in streams across a broad latitudinal gradient. In each of eight study regions, fishes and invertebrates will be intensively sampled. The data will be used by the researcher to develop mathematical models of the relationships between the average size of individuals and the abundance of those individuals within a community as a means of testing the idea about biodiversity and resources. This project will also focus on engaging underrepresented minorities in freshwater research. In each of four years, a group of three minority undergraduates will be trained to conduct stream surveys, to analyze original data, and to present results at the annual meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science, for a total of 12 undergraduates mentored throughout the project. One Ph.D. student identified as an underrepresented minority student also will be trained to compete for leadership-level positions in environmental research or management.<br/><br/>An empirical test of species-energy theory within stream ecosystems will be conducted in three steps. In Step-1, size-spectra (scaling relationships between average individual body mass and population abundance) will be quantified in each of the eight study regions and used to model the distribution of abundance among primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers. Nitrogen stable isotope samples and published feeding behaviors will also be used to assess whether trophic position is a consistent function of body size. Systematic, among-site comparisons of size-spectra models will then test whether the scaling of abundance with individual body mass and trophic position is constant among tropical and temperate streams. In Step-2, species-abundance distributions will be compiled for each study stream then compared among streams to assess whether species richness increases more rapidly, relative to a constant number of individuals, in tropical streams. In Step-3, supplementary fish and invertebrate data from National Ecological Observatory Network streams will be used to test for seasonal or inter-annual differences in the size-spectra and species-abundance distribution models."

Changes in tropical forest productivity in response to drought are an important feedback in the carbon cycle; yet, we currently have a very incomplete understanding of how biomass, productivity, and species composition of these forests respond to changes in temperature and water availability.  This project will take a new approach to understanding tropical forest drought responses by focusing on the relationships between plant functional traits, metabolic scaling theory, and climate drivers.  Functional traits are easily measureable metrics that allow us to better predict plant growth, reproduction, and forest change.  Metabolic scaling theory describes the relationships between the size of an organism, its growth rate, and temperature.  This project will attempt to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical ecosystems respond to changes in temperature and precipitation. Researchers will use scaling theory to provide a predictive framework that links forest responses to drought with well understood plant traits measured using novel ground and remote sensing technology.  <br/><br/>This project will assess changes in productivity in response to drought, as well as tree mortality and forest dieback.  This will be accomplished using both field measurements as well as pre-existing LIDAR and hyperspectral remote sensing data from forests across an elevation gradient in the Peruvian Amazon.  Specifically, researchers will use a suite of plant functional traits to provide detailed, 3D maps of forest canopy structure and the spatial distribution of traits.  The novel scaling theory developed with these data (Trait Driver Theory, TDT) will then be used to predict ecosystem function from changes in trait distributions over time in response to drought.  The project will also involve a field experiment to simulate drought with throughfall collectors to help parameterize TDT model functions.  The TDT results will also be compared to predictions from the ecosystem demography model ED2.  Model code, images, and algorithms will be made available in public repositories, and any new plant functional trait data will be added to global databases.

Predicting these shifts, however, is challenging.  Some modeling studies forecast widespread expansion of forest into tropical savanna, while others forecast massive collapse of tropical forest. The difficulty of predicting and managing savanna-forest transitions arises largely from complex fire-vegetation feedbacks that are influenced by humans, climate, previous fire history, and the characteristics of plant species at a site. An improved understanding of these feedbacks is necessary for developing the next generation of earth system models and for informing management of the seasonally dry tropics. The latter is particularly true in Brazil, where a failure to recognize the natural role of fire has led to policies of fire suppression in areas of native savanna, resulting in forest encroachment into many areas of natural savanna and loss of species that depend upon this habitat. In addition to providing valuable data for managing these systems, this project will promote the acceptance of the natural role of fire with an article to be prepared for a popular science magazine and a white paper to be distributed to managers of Brazilian savanna reserves and state ministers of environment. These documents will review the evidence for the natural role of fire and the consequences of fire suppression. As the project generates results, journalists will be invited to visit the study sites to inform the public of the natural role of fire in Brazilian savannas. Four US undergraduate students will be given international research experiences that will contribute directly to the research objectives of this proposal while stimulate interest and expertise in tropical ecology among US students. Understanding the impacts of fire and fire history on vegetation dynamics is important for fire management in the US.<br/><br/>Understanding of the drivers of species change at the forest-savanna ecotone has been hindered by strong positive feedbacks and other non-linear processes that cause complex dynamics and hysteresis (i.e. the dependency of system not only on its current environment but also on its past environment). These legacy effects confound our ability to observe vegetation responses to environmental change. The proposed research will combine field data and modeling to test for and quantify sources of hysteresis in savanna-forest dynamics. The aims of the research are (1) quantify key processes that underlie switches between savanna and forest states, (2) use this information to refine and parameterize the CLM(ED-SPITFIRE) model for simulating savanna-forest dynamics, and (3) perform simulations to understand environmental controls on the distribution of tropical savanna and forest, with emphasis on causes of hysteresis. This model represents the coupling of a demography-based ecosystem model (ED), a mechanistic model of fire occurrence (SPITFIRE), and a model of land surface processes (CLM) that can optionally be coupled to a general circulation model (CESM).  Much of the data needed to refine, parameterize, and validate the model are available from previous NSF-funded research. Gaps in this information will be resolved with a fire experiment at a natural savanna-forest boundary in Brazil. In the experiment, flammability trials will be used to understand thresholds that mediate vegetation-fire feedbacks. Measurements of biomass production and turnover will quantify the relative roles of primary productivity and mean residence time in governing biome shifts. Monitoring of tree dynamics will provide a more complete understanding of the distinct roles of savanna and forest tree species in these shifts."

Accordingly, this project will use state-of-the art genomic methods to study the diversity and specific functions of these microorganisms. The results will fill a critical gap in understanding the specific metabolic capabilities of these microbes and how they carry out the key ecosystem function of transforming and metabolizing highly complex, riverborne dissolved organic carbon. The data that will be collected are important for predicting the impacts of land-use change, nutrient use, and shifting climate on freshwater quality across the USA. The research involves a collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum Evolution program for inner-city New Haven high-school students to train interns and develop an interactive museum exhibit on U.S. rivers. The project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in science.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to describe interactions and feedbacks between watershed diversity, microbial functional diversity, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry in 36 large U.S. rivers, and to experimentally link gene expression with DOM degradation in five of them (the Altamaha, Columbia, Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Yukon). River sampling will be conducted in collaboration with a U.S. Geological Survey stream network. This research will address the concept that microbial genetic mechanisms in river ecosystems are closely linked to climate and landscape features that control river environmental conditions, particularly DOM quality. This concept implies that microbial function is shaped by DOM composition, climate, and river chemistry.

In the contiguous US, nitrogen inputs have tripled relative to levels during pre-European settlement, primarily due to synthetic fertilizer production, atmospheric deposition from the combustion of fossil fuels, and through agricultural practices.  Consequently, many streams have dramatically higher nutrient concentrations than they did historically, which can lead to algal blooms, fish die-offs, and increased export of nutrients to marine ecosystems.  Streams can be important for regulating nutrient exports from continents to oceans, but the functioning is, in part, mediated by biodiversity, and rates of species losses in streams are among the highest on the planet.  Therefore, understanding interactions among changing nutrient inputs, and declining biodiversity are major and immediate challenges for conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems.  The number of available datasets on stream nutrient concentrations, stream flow, and biodiversity has increased rapidly, but many have yet to be evaluated for temporal or spatial trends, analyzed with state of the art statistical and modeling techniques, or compared across regions.  Further, many large datasets are coming online in the near future, and stream ecologists need to develop strategies to best utilize this emerging information.  The  goal of the Stream Resiliency Research Coordination Network is to link stream ecologists with hydrologists, statisticians, modelers, and resource managers to develop a synthetic understanding of how streams and river ecosystems will respond to chronic nutrient inputs and changing species diversity.  The network will meet through a series of workshops and webinars to develop new approaches to analyzing existing and forthcoming stream nutrient and organism datasets, and conduct state of the knowledge syntheses.  An initial one-day planning workshop associated with the 2014 Joint Aquatic Sciences meeting will be hosted to engage the research community.  Following the planning meeting, four three-day workshops will be held addressing topics focused on understanding long-term change in stream ecosystems, how ecosystem processes vary across river networks from small headwater streams to larger rivers, and the interactions among organisms in the context of changing climate, altered land-use, and loss of biodiversity.  Each workshop will include one day focused on training in data analysis and modeling approaches not typically used by stream ecologists, and two days focused on data analyses and synthesis.

Each workshop will include training of a targeted statistical or modeling approach, provide educational opportunity for both graduate students and established researchers, and produce tangible applied products for natural resource managers and policy makers.  In addition, an online graduate level seminar will be hosted focusing on stream functioning in a changing environment, providing an opportunity for students across the globe to learn about the activities and findings from the network."

Researchers at the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research Program (CDR) are using long-term models and data from grasslands, savannas, and forests to understand and forecast how these interacting human-driven environmental changes will alter the earth?s ecosystems and the ability of ecosystems to provide the services that support human well-being. This work builds on the CDR hallmark of combining data from long-term experiments and observations to explore the interactive effects of changes in resources (nutrients, atmospheric carbon dioxide), abiotic aspects of the environment (temperature, precipitation), biodiversity, and disturbance (fire, land use change) on linked ecological processes at local to global scales. In addition to this primary research goal, the CDR program will continue to develop a diverse, globally competitive workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) by mentoring undergraduate researchers and providing them with independent research and professional development opportunities. CDR also will continue to increase public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through K-12 education programs, citizen science activities, membership and volunteer programs, public tours, adult education, as well as arts and humanities partnerships. These activities reach thousands of visitors and participants each year, including teachers, neighbors, public officials, and other members of the public in Minnesota.<br/><br/>CDR research will continue its multi-decadal studies of the ecological impacts of multiple environmental change drivers, including the longest-running biodiversity and elevated CO2 experiments in the world, and some of the world's longest-running studies of nutrient enrichment and fire frequency.

For example, a new forest biodiversity experiment will build on past CDR biodiversity research to disentangle the roles of multiple facets of biodiversity (functional, phylogenetic, and species) and use trees to test the generality of biodiversity theory. Second, new experiments replicated in the long-term biodiversity experiment and savanna will determine the interactive effects of drought, nutrients, warming, and biodiversity on ecosystem processes and stability. Third, new initiatives will develop and test models that predict how ecosystems recover from chronic nitrogen enrichment. Fourth, new experiments will test hypotheses about the how consumers such as bison and fire disturbance interact to restructure and alter the functioning of grassland, savanna, and forest ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their goal is to determine the fitness cost of all possible mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome using new laboratory techniques and new statistical methods. Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and the fuel of evolution. But whether a particular mutation persists and contributes to variation within a population is determined by its fitness cost. Mutations with high fitness costs will likely be eliminated from the population versus those with little or no fitness costs. Knowledge of mutational fitness is central to many basic questions in evolutionary biology, but also has critical practical application, for example, for predicting evolution of resistance to antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and pesticides. Despite this importance, estimating fitness costs remains one of the key challenges in modern evolutionary genomics. The researchers will analyze clinical samples from a combination of 75 HIV subtype B and subtype C patients using innovative genomic and computational methods.

Their goal is to determine the fitness cost of all possible mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome using new laboratory techniques and new statistical methods. Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation and the fuel of evolution. But whether a particular mutation persists and contributes to variation within a population is determined by its fitness cost. Mutations with high fitness costs will likely be eliminated from the population versus those with little or no fitness costs. Knowledge of mutational fitness is central to many basic questions in evolutionary biology, but also has critical practical application, for example, for predicting evolution of resistance to antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and pesticides. Despite this importance, estimating fitness costs remains one of the key challenges in modern evolutionary genomics. The researchers will analyze clinical samples from a combination of 75 HIV subtype B and subtype C patients using innovative genomic and computational methods.

Without oxygen, some microbes are capable of converting nitrogen in the water into N2 gas, which then leaves the ocean and enters the atmosphere. This loss of an important nutrient from the ocean has impacts on phytoplankton growth and marine food webs. While oxygen deficient zones occupy a very small percentage of the ocean, they account for as much as half of the oceanic loss of N as N2. Moreover, the size of these regions is predicted to expand during this century due to climate change. The microbes that are capable of producing N2 gas are extremely diverse, and use several different biochemical pathways to carry out this process.  They may occur both free-floating in the water and attached to small particles that are suspended or sinking from the surface waters and providing them a carbon source.  However the importance of these two lifestyles (free-living vs particle attached) in terms of contributions to N loss from the oceans is not well understood. This project will identify the major organisms that result in N2 gas production on both suspended and sinking particles, the chemical reactions they carry out, and the rates at which this occurs.  This information will be used to improve global climate models to better predict rates of N loss in a future ocean.  Elementary and middle school teachers enrolled in a Masters in Science for Science Teachers program will be involved in the project and the graduate students and post-doctoral researchers supported by the project will have opportunities to participate in their classrooms.  Underserved populations will also be integrated into the research at the undergraduate and middle school level through a series of summer internships.<br/><br/>ODZs have very complex elemental cycles, implying great microbial diversity. Intertwined with the microbial complexity of ODZ regions is the relatively unexplored interplay between free-living bacteria and those living on either suspended or sinking particles. Determining how these communities and niches interact and relate is one of the most challenging components of ODZ system studies today. Current climate models portray the dynamics of particles in the ODZs and throughout the deep ocean through prescribed functions based on sparse data from the oxic ocean with microbes represented only by the net chemical reactions of the community.  However, in reality a phylogenetically and metabolically diverse group of microbes, likely acting in consortia, are responsible for the nitrogen transformations that ultimately result in the production of N2. To explore the processes maintaining the genetic diversity and functional redundancy in N loss processes, four research areas will be integrated: the community phylogenetic diversity (both taxonomic and genomic diversity) the genetic diversity of the proteins that carry out key N transformation processes (as seen through quantitative proteomics), the resulting biogeochemical functions (15N labeled nitrogen transformation rate measurements) and predictions about how this diversity and corresponding function may change in response to climate change (biogeochemical modeling). The approach will be to assay both phylogenetic (16S rRNA tag sequencing) and functional genetic diversity (genomics) on sinking particles collected using large-volume sediment traps. Phylogenetic and genomic studies will be intimately tied to measurements of activity - who is doing key biogeochemical transformations (proteomics) and what are the in situ rates at which they are doing them (using novel incubation systems). Data will then be used to model how diversity and corresponding function change on a range of time and space scales, from the sinking of a single particle to seasonal cycles. To understand the relationship of community diversity and function on suspended and sinking particles, a series of three cruises will be conducted in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific ODZ."

Therefore, fungal and plant biology cannot be fully understood without studying them within the context of their symbiotic interactions. With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming clear that the 100,000 known species of fungi represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 5.1 million species of fungi present in nature. Amazingly, the largest fraction of this unknown fungal diversity seems to be hidden in healthy leaves of plants and lichens, as endophytic and endolichenic fungi. Endophytes are known to protect plants from pathogens, and enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses such as droughts and high temperatures. Most of these hyperdiverse endophytic and endolichenic fungi are classified within a group of filamentous Ascomycota fungi called the Pezizomycotina. The main aims of this research are to reconstruct a phylogeny (genealogical relationships) for the Pezizomycotina and link this evolutionary framework with a rich and diverse set of organismal data. The research will be complemented by diverse outreach activities, engagement of high school students in research, training of junior scientists in five states, and development of tools with potential applications for studying the evolution of species interactions across the life sciences. Accelerating the discovery of these hidden fungi also promises to provide a rich source of secondary compounds for new pharmaceutical and biocontrol products.<br/><br/>The objectives of this study are to fill the largest phylogenetic void in the fungal genealogy of life (the Pezizomycotina) and integrate diverse data layers with the emergent tree as a means to understand the evolution, ecology, and physiology of fungal-plant symbioses. Culture-dependent and independent methods will generate the largest sample of endophytic and endolichenic fungi to date, targeting diverse plants, lichens, macroalgae, and co-occurring microalgae and cyanobacteria in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments, with a focus on biotically rich but understudied bioclimatic zones. Efficient collecting and analytical pipelines will enable rapid integration of phylogenetic data from these new symbiotic fungi into the fungal genealogy of life, while novel biodiversity informatics tools will integrate existing multi-locus and phylogenomic frameworks with short sequence reads obtained with next-generation sequencing. Resulting evolutionary trees, greatly enriched by systematic sampling of currently unknown biodiversity, will be integrated with host and trophic spectra in three data layers (symbio-phylogenetic, eco-phylogenetic, and physio-phylogenetic), enabling for the first time novel insights from geographic data, abiotic and biotic factors, and the physiological traits that enable mutualistic interactions with plants on which most communities depend."

Understanding what determines biodiversity is important because it allows one to predict and manage especially diverse, often vulnerable, patches of habitat.  Because it is practically impossible to rigorously test the determinants of biodiversity in natural areas, this project will take place in the laboratory. Researchers will create miniature, patchy worlds of very small animals that live in water to study what happens on much larger scales to animals in the real world.

It is the primary food source for microbes and the principal storehouse of water necessary for plant growth. SOM also stores nutrients for plants and absorbs pollutants that otherwise could contaminate food and water supplies. Soils also help regulate climate by storing carbon that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. This project investigates processes in the soil that protect SOM from being completely consumed by microbes and conversely, processes that could increase its sensitivity  to environmental changes.  The researchers will also study how climate change and changes in how land is managed affect the amount and stability of SOM. The project involves a large number of researchers and laboratories in conducting a wide range of SOM analyses. It takes advantage of soil samples already collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a major NSF investment in environmental monitoring that covers the entire United States. The samples will be preserved and the data that results from this project made fully public via the web.<br/><br/>The evolution of a new paradigm, where the primary controls on SOM dynamics are less dependent on molecular structure than on other soil and ecosystem properties, has created a knowledge gap in our ability to predict the response of SOM to environmental change. The relationships among shifting controls over different SOM stabilization mechanisms, ranging from distal factors operating at broad spatial scales (e.g., climate) to proximal controls operating at finer spatial scales (e.g., soil physicochemical properties), are poorly defined. Investigators will test the emerging paradigm by quantifying relationships between the dominant mechanisms of SOM stabilization and the scale of the ecosystem controls (i.e., fine-scale, proximal vs. broad-scale, distal) across a continental-scale system of soil types and ecological domains, utilizing soil samples collected during the construction of NEON. This project will be the first continental-scale assessment of SOM vulnerability and will yield new, predictive insights into controls on SOM stability across soil types, land-use types and environmental gradients. The results will significantly improve our understanding of SOM dynamics, a fundamental scientific advancement in its own right, while also enabling better representation of soils in ecosystem and coupled carbon-climate models. The project represents a new standard in open, community-oriented research, supporting participation by researchers from universities, government and non-government agencies. It will facilitate collaboration through major scientific networks that are increasingly necessary to conduct science at the scale needed to address the complex issues facing society. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in state-of-the-science methods of soil science by participating in this research, and insights derived from it will inform decisions by policymakers and resource managers concerned with carbon sequestration and ecosystem services."

These important natural resources that contribute ecosystem services such as carbon storage, nutrient cycling, water and air purification, and wildlife habitat are impacted by natural and man-made disturbances.  Those disturbances include climate variation, air pollution, invasive species and forest harvesting, and this research focuses on how forest ecosystems respond to those disturbances. Despite a long record of research on forest ecosystems, recent observations from HBR of how trees move water through the ecosystem, the role of calcium in forest health, the movement of nitrogen through the ecosystem, and the interactions of plants, insects, and birds within the forest indicate that much is still unknown. Most of the research will occur within the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a site in the White Mountain region of New Hampshire that is operated by the U.S. Forest Service. The research team will measure the forms of nitrogen retained in soils, the growth and death of trees, the fates of germinating tree seedlings, the amounts and types of litter fall, rates of soil respiration, and how fine roots respond to nitrogen and phosphorus additions.  They also will test how the exchanges of gases, heat, and water vapor between forests and the atmosphere respond to the timing of leaf out in the spring and leaf fall in the autumn. Information about forested ecosystems and the streams that drain them will be made available to land managers through a Forest Science Dialogues Program and a Science Policy Exchange and will inform policy and management decisions on a regional and national scale. The educational and outreach activities planned, including development of classroom curricula for middle- and high school students, a Research Experience for Undergraduates program that is organized in partnership with Plymouth State University, the training of teachers through the Research Experiences for Teachers program, and development of Waterviz, a water cycle visualization tool, will bring ecological knowledge to the public as well as students and teachers at levels from K-12 to graduate school.<br/><br/>The conceptual model underpinning the HBR-LTER project envisions three principal types of disturbance acting as drivers of change in the ecosystem: atmospheric chemistry, climate, and biota. The effects of these drivers play out on geophysical and historical templates that include variation across the landscape in bedrock, soils, hydrology, climate and history of past disturbance. Within the ecosystem, the disturbances affect the interacting processes of hydrology, biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics and food web dynamics.  Research on the changing atmosphere is focused primarily on the legacies of past air pollution, particularly the depletion of nutrient cations such as calcium from the soil and the accumulation of nitrogen in soil and vegetation. Research on the impacts of climate is focused on causes of the observed long-term decline in evapotranspiration at the site and the effects of changing timing and duration of seasonal transitions on plants, soils, microbes, animals and stream ecosystems. Research on biotic change is focused on the changing composition and structure of the forests caused by multiple interacting stressors including climate, new plant species immigrations, invasive forest pests, and altered disturbance regimes.  Research methods include: long-term field measurements with stable isotopes to provide a better resolution of the strengths of nitrogen sinks in soils and metagenomics shotgun sequencing of community DNA (Illumina HiSeq platform) to provide initial characterization of how microbial community composition and function vary with soil depth; field experiments to identify belowground responses that mediate nutrient recycling and plant uptake in response to nutrient additions and the ensuing impacts on soil enzyme activities, microbial nutrient pools and turnover, rhizosphere allocation, and mycorrhizal functional groups;  simulation modeling with quantitative models such as stand-level ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling models, a carbon and nitrogen model parameterized for individual tree species, an ecosystem demography model, and a multiple element limitation model to synthesize data and experimental knowledge will be used to identify knowledge gaps, develop hypotheses, and make prediction of future forest behavior; and  laboratory studies including 15N NMR to better determine the forms of nitrogen retained in soil organic matter. Education activities include hosting school groups at the site, hands-on training of teachers in scientific research, mentoring undergraduate student research projects, and facilitating research by graduate students.  Outreach activities include synthesizing results of research done at HBR and elsewhere, and communicating the science to local stakeholders through roundtable discussions, to the public through targeted media, and to policy makers through briefings and publications addressing specific policy questions."

Organisms can adapt to the urban environment by changing their physiology, morphology, and behaviors. Because these organisms can play important roles in  nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, water and air purification, and food production, any changes in their traits might have significant effects on human well-being. The challenge is to understand the mechanisms of urban-driven evolutionary change and determine whether these changes might affect ecosystem function at the planetary scale. This complex challenge can only be addressed by combining the expertise, data, and analytical methods of evolutionary biologists, ecosystem scientists, ecologists, urban ecologists, palaeoecologists, and archaeologists. A new Research Coordination Network (RCN) will bring together scientists from different institutions to design and perform long-term cross-comparative studies, to synthesize the science, and to explore mechanisms that link urban development patterns to rapid evolution and the potential for those changes to feedback to shape ecosystems. The RCN will train scholars, postdocs, and PhD students, and will recruit members with diverse backgrounds offering them direct experience in collaborative, transdisciplinary research. The network will organize conference workshops and symposia, develop searchable databases, maintain an interactive website, lead collaborative papers, develop undergraduate and graduate seminars at the participants' institutions, and create a science-practice exchange program between scientists and conservation planners. The RCN will establish pilot cross-city citizen science projects to monitor eco-evolutionary dynamics and convey key findings to the public.<br/><br/>Participants will explore four central questions: (1) What is the evidence for urban signatures of phenotypic change distinct from natural and other anthropogenic drivers? (2) To what degree does urban trait change differ among branches of the tree of life, or among distinct life-history strategies, traits or biomes? (3) To what degree can trait changes be attributed to phenotypic plasticity or to evolutionary change? (4) What are the functional consequences of urban-induced evolutionary changes on ecosystems? The goal is for the team to more accurately predict the responses of populations, communities, and ecosystems to urbanization. Investigators will use meta-analyses of individual character variation among urban and non-urban environments and multimodel inference to evaluate competing hypotheses and to assess the relative importance of predictor variables. They will also use targeted mechanistic experiments to test specific predictions suggested by the meta-analysis and use partitioning metrics to separate the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time there are major gaps in our understanding of tundra/permafrost microbiology and elemental cycling. Filling these knowledge gaps will enable a better overall understanding of the tundra, and can provide crucial information about how this globally important, but fragile ecosystem will respond to change. The particular knowledge gap this research will fill centers around iron and the bacteria that control its availability. Iron is an essential micro-nutrient for animals, plants, and microbes. It also serves as a growth substrate for certain groups of bacteria, many of which fix carbon dioxide to grow. Some of these bacteria directly compete with other groups of microbes that produce or consume methane, the atmospheric concentration of which is continuing to increase. It is particularly important to understand the dynamics of carbon dioxide and methane in the Arctic because there is a large amount of organic carbon stored in permafrost that could be converted into these two gases. The research team consists of a microbial ecologist with considerable experience in iron cycling bacteria; a mathematical modeler who will quantify the relative impacts of different microbial processes, and a tundra ecologist with extensive experience in elemental cycling in permafrost environments.  This project will, for the first time, systematically characterize and quantify microbial communities responsible for iron cycling in the tundra/permafrost of Alaska?s North Slope, and increase our understanding of how these microbes interact with the carbon cycle by suppressing methane production. <br/><br/>The basic supposition of this research is that conditions in the Arctic are beneficial to an active iron cycle because the shallow depth permafrost prevents ferrous iron-laden waters from percolating into deep aquifers (a common route for iron removal from temperate ecosystems). Furthermore, cool water temperatures slow the chemical oxidation of iron, and a short, but intense growing season provides a source of labile carbon that helps fuel iron reduction. These ideas will be tested by conducting field and laboratory studies at the Toolik Field Station on the North Slope of Alaska. Previous work has revealed there are extensive populations of iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing bacteria associated with microbial iron mats in this region, but in general, little is known about their diversity or function. This work will utilize cultivation-independent, amplicon-based community analysis and metagenomics to further characterize community diversity and function among these chemosynthetic communities. The team will measure methane production at tundra sites with high rates of iron cycling and compare these to sites that are similar in terms of hydrology and landform, but have lower rates of iron-cycling to assess the direct impact of the iron cycle on methane production and consumption. The microbiomes of these sites will also be compared using molecular analysis. In addition to these field measurements, the researchers will construct a laboratory microcosm that can be seeded with soils and microbial iron mats collected from Toolik. This will allow controlled conditions to simulate interactions of the iron and methane cycles under conditions where key parameters such as iron and oxygen concentrations can be controlled. From both field and laboratory data a reaction-based model will be developed using a series of kinetic equations. These will form the basis for a predictive model that can estimate the suppressive effects of iron cycling on methane production. In terms of broader impacts, the work will provide unique opportunities for training undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, in combining field, laboratory, and modelling based science to fill an important gap in our knowledge of the tundra ecosystem. To broaden public outreach two artists will be engaged to create a unique art-science dialog that will broaden the interpretation of the project results, and provide museum quality creative work that can be displayed in either science or art exhibits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The last 100 years have witnessed habitat changes to the planet at an accelerating pace. Very little is known about how species respond to this, because there are usually no detailed historical records of where species lived or what they were like in the past. Specimens from natural history museums, however, can provide a snapshot in time of what species were like decades ago. This project takes advantage of an unparalleled museum collection of North and Middle American birds from the 1930s to 1950s. Using new technology that can extract DNA from these specimens, the researchers will compare historic and modern samples to understand how the genomes of birds have changed in response to changes to their habitats. Additionally, records of bird sightings from the historical field notes will be compared to thousands of modern observation records collected by citizen scientists to determine how the geographic distributions of birds have changed. Combining research with outreach, an international resurvey effort will work with citizen-science experts at eBird to compare bird species at 300 sites originally sampled between 1933 and 1955. Joint, international field resurveys of 15 historic collecting sites will provide complementary on-the-ground data collected by experts. Results of this research will provide unprecedented detail to changes in the genomic and distributional landscape of birds at a continental scale. All facets of the work will be integrated with an undergraduate research program that will train the next generation of biologists with the latest genomics equipment and techniques well-suited to both the public and private sector. <br/><br/>The researchers will assess changes in the DNA of 20 focal bird species whose habitats have been dramatically altered in modern times. The comparisons of historical to modern samples will test whether species in the western coastal lowlands of southern North America have experienced range expansion due to the conversion of native thornscrub habitat to irrigated cropland, and whether highland conifer forest species have experienced loss of genetic diversity due to habitat fragmentation. DNA will be extracted using thousands of conserved genomic anchors that can capture and retrieve the damaged DNA found in older museum specimens. Later analysis will stitch these smaller fragments into larger pieces, allowing for genomic analysis of diversity and connectivity among populations and comparison between time points. Genomic research using next-generation sequencing techniques, particularly using conserved elements, has yet to study evolution at such a shallow scale in vertebrates. This research will clarify the utility of conserved genomic fragments in discovering the impact of habitat degradation and other human influences on the genomes of wild organisms."

With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming clear that the 100,000 known species of fungi represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 5.1 million species of fungi present in nature. Amazingly, the largest fraction of this unknown fungal diversity seems to be hidden in healthy leaves of plants and lichens, as endophytic and endolichenic fungi. Endophytes are known to protect plants from pathogens, and enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses such as droughts and high temperatures.

Developing a theory on ecosystem change is complicated by several factors. Animal and plant species interact with a variety of other species, and migrate from one location in an ecosystem to another. The changes in plant and animal species involve factors that are predictable, like seasonal migrations, and other factors that are unpredictable, like week-to-week and day-to-day changes in temperature and rainfall. In this project, the investigators develop new theoretical approaches for understanding how unpredictable changes affect complex ecosystems, providing managers with a better framework for making decisions that affect society and students with training.    <br/><br/>Species in ecosystems affect one another in a variety of ways, directly and indirectly, and thereby are connected by an ecological network. In current mathematical models of ecological networks, unpredictable events (referred to as stochasticity), are omitted for simplicity, in order to make the computations tractable. In this project, the investigators will develop a theory of stochastic processes in ecological networks to provide guidelines for when and how stochastic fluctuations should be included in computational models. Ecological network models with realistic complexity (large numbers of nodes and connections) and population sizes (finite rather than infinite) naturally exhibit random fluctuations due to demographic stochasticity (variation in birth and death rates) and environmental stochasticity (unpredictable events such as extreme weather, earthquakes and landslides). Fluctuations around average population behavior can play an important role, for instance in extinction events or invasions, but modeling all stochastic elements in a realistic ecological network is conceptually and numerically taxing.  Building on recent innovations in theoretical neuroscience (the ""stochastic shielding"" heuristic) the investigators will develop a framework that can greatly reduce the number of independent stochastic processes needed to accurately represent the fluctuations in a select set of nodes of interest (e.g. representing focal species or critical habitat patches). The project will create a framework for exploiting data on not only average population sizes but also variances, by developing the theoretical underpinnings that complement existing efforts to bring ecological science into the age of big data."

The increasing availability of large volumes of different kinds of data offers new opportunities to address these issues. This project will provide the environmental research community with efficient and reliable means for data management, storage, and sharing. The facilities developed will allow researchers, policy makers, managers, and other stakeholders to bring relevant data to bear on complex environmental questions. Modern approaches that encourage geographically distributed collaboration will be used to increase efficiency of data curation beyond those available for single projects. The project will provide the training and skills needed to overcome technical and social barriers to collaboration, thereby enhancing infrastructure to address ecological questions over broad spatial and temporal scales.<br/><br/>Research in environmental sciences is often conducted by individual investigators over small spatial and temporal scales under funding models that provide limited capacity for data curation or sharing. Data that are archived in a stable, accessible repository and that are accompanied by appropriate metadata benefit both data producers and consumers through improved discoverability and reliability. This project builds on expertise available in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community to provide these benefits. The project will leverage the collective experience of the LTER community to improve data management across a broad community through communication and collaboration. Training activities will be developed that range from the basics of metadata creation to the adoption of standardized best practices for specific types of data. The development of templates for describing a data lifecycle will accelerate the availability of data for synthesis. The project will promote shared technology to develop more commonly usable and more efficient approaches to data curation workflows. Participants in training workshops will be trained in developing workflow technology, re-using existing workflows, and archiving and sharing their developments. Through these workshops, together with community-level centers of expertise, and individual-based skill exchanges, the project will increase the volume of data available along with data discoverability and reuse.  The Provenance Aware Synthesis Architecture repository will ensure long-term availability of data and open data access through federations such as DataONE. This repository will be expanded in several ways to accommodate a broader community of data providers and users. Enhancements include a scalable user identity management system, improved data documentation procedures to simplify data submission for non-technical users, and expanded data-quality assurance tools to accommodate a broader range of community practices.  These advances will accelerate scientific inquiry through data curation and publication as well as through data discovery and integration."

Development of strategies to manage and conserve tropical forested ecosystems globally depends critically on understanding the mechanisms by which these ecosystems respond to natural and human-induced change. The program will train numerous graduate and undergraduate students, especially members of underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of collaborative, multidisciplinary scientists who can link population, community, and ecosystem approaches to provide a predictive understanding of environmental change. An active schoolyard program develops K-12 curricula in science and mathematics throughout Puerto Rico, including a new 'data jam' workshop in which teachers will use the project's data to investigate basic ecological questions. The program will engage Puerto Rican high school students and teachers in educational programs at the El Verde Field Station. To date, 954 teachers and 1662 students have participated in an interactive teaching website, the Journey to El Yunque. The project collaborates with other large-scale networks including the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, the Cloud Forest Research Coordination Network, and the Forest Global Earth Observatories, strengthening research infrastructure to tackle future challenges. <br/><br/>The Luquillo LTER project will, over the coming three years, explore the development of novel ecosystems resulting from the separate and combined effects of increased drought and hurricane frequencies as these disturbances are mediated by land use legacies. Researchers predict that novel ecosystems resulting from these altered disturbances will differ from previous and current ones both structurally and functionally, and will integrate biogeochemistry, productivity, and population and community ecology studies to understand these differences. Two new experiments will be added to ongoing efforts: a stream drought experiment in which stream flow is reduced by manipulation and a forest through-fall reduction experiment in which rainfall is manipulated. The stream experiment will manipulate stream flow to examine the short- and long-term effects of drought on biota and biogeochemical cycling. The through fall exclusion experiment will determine the impact of multiple short-term droughts on soil biogeochemistry as well as on microbes, seedlings, and litter organisms. Results from both manipulations will be incorporated into models to investigate long-term effects and to evaluate the feasibility of future large scale manipulations that are logistically challenging in the forested ecosystems. A novel canopy trimming experiment will continue to simulate hurricanes in order to examine the effects of changes in hurricane frequencies and to separate the effects of canopy openness from deposition of material to the forest floor on forest composition, soil carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, and forest floor community structure. Results will test the hypothesis that increased frequency of intense hurricanes will increase the dominance of shade intolerant species with cascading effects through other biota and biogeochemistry. This integration of observational and experimental approaches is powerful because the effects of these disturbances over long time periods are poorly understood. The potential to gain insight into the mechanisms whereby these disturbance regimes result in future non-analog ecosystems in tropical forests is high and will significantly advance understanding of ecosystem ecology."

Marine ostracods, tiny shrimp-like crustaceans, use light for both avoiding predators and for behavioral displays. Over 64 bioluminescent flashing patterns have been observed throughout the Caribbean but only one third of the species have been collected and described scientifically. The proposed research will bring together a group of collaborators from institutions in Wisconsin and California to investigate the diversity of bioluminescent ostracods in the Caribbean and address how bioluminescence and complex behavioral displays have evolved within the group. Research will involve students and faculty at multiple stages in their careers, archivists of digital and morphological materials, and members of the science education media. The timing of this research is especially crucial as the assembled team of researchers includes two emeritus experts on bioluminescent ostracods who will participate in field collections and taxonomy workshops. The products of this research will include a diverse group of newly trained undergraduate and graduate students, a large comprehensive data set of newly described species that will be shared publically through museum and online curation, advancement in the bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome DNA and behavioral traits, and a better understanding of the link between genetics and complex trait evolution. <br/><br/>This collaborative project by researchers at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, California State University - Los Angeles, and University of California - Santa Barbara will use a diverse set of complimentary techniques to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Cypridinidae and the evolution of bioluminescence and complex behavioral displays.

Once trees die, wood-containing carbon is consumed by organisms such as microbes and insects. Such carbon can be emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane gas. Additionally, only some microbes can break down lignin, a critical building block of wood. When they are unable to do so, remaining lignin gets locked in soil. The tropics have vast stores of carbon in trees but little is known about where that carbon ends up. Both microbes and termites consume tropical wood, but which one does the job alters how fast and in what form carbon is released. Typically, microbes need lots of moisture to thrive on wood, but termites may require less since they can hide in their nest mounds and store water if it becomes too dry. Scientists have been trying to model global carbon cycling under environmental change, but they have yet to include the decay of wood by microbes and insects in their studies. The researchers on this study predict that these organisms have an enormous impact on global carbon cycling. The experimental field work will cut across ecosystems with varying rainfall in Queensland, Australia, from wet rainforest to dry savanna. At these different sites, the researchers will compare how fast termites versus microbes consume the wood and what gases are released during wet and dry seasons. The results will be incorporated into computer models to determine how termites and microbes affect carbon cycling at regional to global scales. Such information will be fed back to the scientific community to make better predictions about the global carbon cycle. This project is an international collaboration between scientists in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, and is supported, in part, by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering. Additionally, workshops will bring together project scientists with forestry stakeholders to develop potential strategies for preventing the decay of carbon in wood, and reducing natural carbon emissions. The project will also support education and training of junior scientists. <br/><br/>Three questions will be addressed in this project: Q1. What controls rates of coarse wood debris carbon turnover? Turnover rates will be determined by measuring termite and microbe activity, which are dependent on climate and wood construction. Wetter conditions should increase turnover, but termites should increase turnover relatively more in dry conditions due to their water conservation strategies. Dense, highly lignified wood should decay more slowly. Q2. What controls fates of carbon liberated from coarse wood debris? Carbon fates (carbon dioxide, methane, soil organic residues) will depend on the stage of wood decay and the composition of termite and microbial communities. Later stages of decay, increased abundance or activity of methanogenic archaea, (or decreased bacterial methanotropy) and changes in termite species should result in greater methane/carbon dioxide ratios. Greater organic residue formation is predicted to occur when carbon loss is via termites. Q3. How do mechanisms of wood turnover scale up to affect ecosystem-level carbon fluxes under environmental change? To date, coarse wood debris is poorly parameterized in Earth system models (e.g., coarse wood debris is assumed to decay only via physical fragmentation). Field data from Q1 and Q2 will be used to drive new predictive models of wood turnover and gas emission under environmental change. To test Q1 and determine relative wood-associated microbe and termite decay rates in response to precipitation variation, blocks of pine known to attract termites will be placed at six sites. Blocks will be enclosed in fine-mesh with or without holes to limit termite access. Blocks will be harvested at the end of wet and dry seasons for four years. To determine the influence of wood construction on decay, replicate logs of ten species/site will be placed at rainforest and savannah sites. Logs will be harvested at the end of wet and dry seasons. For logs/blocks, initial and final mass, density and chemistry will be measured. To test Q2, wood subsamples and termites in wood will be collected to determine termite community, microbial community and decay gene composition, and organic residue formation. Carbon dioxide and methane will be measured for harvested logs/blocks. As some termites live in mound nests, experimental mounds will be established and carbon dioxide and methane fluxes will be measured in mounds in a one-year experiment. To test Q3, field data will be incorporated into woodCLM, an ecosystem model derived from the Community Land Model. Results from the modified and original models will be compared. Using woodCLM, wood dynamics and gas emissions will be simulated under future environmental scenarios at the sites.  The project will include training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels, and is part of an international collaborative effort with scientists in England funded by the United Kingdom's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)."

This research will resurvey field sites in the southwest United States last surveyed more than 70 years ago, which will not only advance our understanding of environmental changes but will establish a new benchmark for comparison of future changes. Federal land-management agencies will benefit from greater knowledge of the status of sensitive species and wildlife responses to climate change.

These areas have warmed greatly over the last 50 years, with the average annual temperatures increasing up to 2C. The research will advance understanding of animal responses to climate change by: developing new models that mechanistically project species' ranges by linking climate through important physiological thresholds of temperature and water stress; developing novel tests to examine whether climate change results in species shifting their geographic ranges individually or whether whole communities of species shift similarly; and testing if body sizes and diets of species have responded to climate change. Birds and mammals will be resurveyed at 105 sites. Both audio and physical voucher specimens will be collected and made available for future reanalysis. Standard morphological data will be collected for birds and mammal skulls. Ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be measured from tissues. Multispecies occupancy models will account for detectability in historical and current surveys to develop unbiased estimators of local colonization and extinction of species and changes in community composition in response to site-level characteristics. Measures of thermal and hydric stress at and above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone will be made for 12 species of mammals to develop models of heat stress that can be validated."

Many of these live in the gut and are known as the microbiome. Insect symbionts are theorized to bring new features that allow species formation and habitat invasions. In the case of insects that feed on food lacking important nutrients, highly specialized microbes inhabit organs in the abdomen and provide essential amino acids and vitamins. The major goal of this proposal is to study the interactions between insects and microbes and how they function together in a mutually beneficial relationship. The roles of endosymbionts in speciation and biogeography are largely unexplored and their diversity and evolution is poorly known outside a handful of model systems. This research uses cicadas as a study system because they have a particularly deficient diet and are diverse and spread across the globe. DNA data will be used to construct a dated evolutionary tree to study how the cicadas and their symbiont partners have spread around the world and diversified into new species. This information will be useful in general understanding how microorganisms benefit their hosts and specifically in the study of invasions of beneficial and pest insects of agricultural importance. Biodiversity information for cicadas and their symbionts will be disseminated to scientists and the general public by journal publications, society meetings, and the World Wide Web. Citizen science projects and biology lab exercises will be designed and made available. Future scientists will be trained in multiple laboratories, including one postdoc and two graduate students; many undergraduate participants will interact with scientists internationally via the web. <br/><br/>Cicada primary endosymbionts have already been demonstrated to include examples of evolution that are surprisingly different from those of other insects, such as rampant symbiont genome duplication/lineage splitting in diverse cicada lineages followed by complementary gene loss and pseudogene formation. To understand the biogeography and evolution of host-symbiont consortia, an existing cicada phylogeny created previously by the research team involved in this work will be expanded and used as a framework. Ecological and symbiont data mapped onto the tree will test hypotheses about the relative timing of changes in cicada habitat association and symbiont consortium membership. This work asks: 1) Does the gain of a secondary (facultative) endosymbiont facilitate the breakdown and or loss of primary (obligate) endosymbiont? Or, 2) Does the breakdown or loss of the obligate endosymbiont allow the invasion of a secondary endosymbiont? Similarly, 3) Do changes in the gut microbiota affect primary endosymbionts (keeping in mind that gut microbiota are known to synthesize essential amino acids for some hosts). Finally, 4) Is symbiont consortium membership related to changes in the external environment (both biotic and abiotic) such as the invasion of new habitats with different environmental conditions and host plants. Improved high-throughput genomic sequencing methods and probes for conserved endosymbiont genes will simultaneously expand the framework Cicadidae evolutionary tree while generating genetic datasets for both of the primary cicada endosymbionts. Surveys of cicada symbiotic partners using metagenomic sequencing (of bacteriomes and fat bodies for endosymbionts) and amplicon sequencing (of gut contents for microbiome studies) will allow the exploration of microbial and fungal symbiont biodiversity. Our hypothesis testing will facilitate exploration of environmental versus evolutionary drivers of biodiversity innovation. New information on the evolution of bacterial endosymbiont genomes will also be produced."

Comparisons of DNA sequences have been used to build reliable evolutionary trees for many groups of organisms. Yet in cases where species hybridize with one another (or have done so in the past), their descendants become a mosaic of genetic backgrounds, and this genetic mixing makes it more difficult to back-calculate their past relationships. Hybridization is particularly common in groups of species that have undergone rapid radiations - situations when large numbers of species evolve over a relatively short period of time - while at the same time these rapid radiations are models for many other kinds of evolutionary analysis. This project will investigate the type of genomic regions that are exchanged among species during rapid radiations. A central goal of the researchers is to develop a computer program that leverages large-scale genomic data to better understand the phylogenetic relationships among species, improving the ability to incorporate the effects of past hybridization events. This tool will be made available to the research community to help biologists understand evolution at the tips of the tree of life. The project will add interactive multimedia-based modules on phylogenetics and systematics to the highly successful All About Bird Biology website.  The project is a funded collaboratively by the NSF and the Binational Science Foundation of Israel.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to test questions about the degree and type of genomic regions exchanged among species in rapid radiations, and to explore the implications for phylogenetic inference. These objectives are based on the further development of a new bioinformatics tool (Generalized Phylogenetic Coalescent Sampler - G-PhoCS) that will allow scientists studying non-model organisms to test hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships and generate detailed demographic inferences (e.g., quantifying gene flow, effective population sizes and divergence times) across a phylogeny, using a variety of genomic-scale datasets. As empirical test cases, the researchers will leverage natural evolutionary experiments in two avian radiations in which pairs of species can be classified as either introgression-prone or introgression-resistant based on external criteria such as ecological overlap and sympatry/allopatry. The research team brings together systematists and computer scientists attempting to realize the full potential of newly emerging high throughput sequence data by developing inference methods that make use of the rich information they provide. This collaboration will more generally broaden the understanding of the patterns and processes underlying genealogical discordance among regions of the genome."

Well-characterized adaptive radiations are relatively rare, and tend to be studied intensively by organismal biologists once they have become established as model systems for study. Examples of classical adaptive radiations include Darwin's Finches, the Hawaiian Silversword alliance of plants, and the cichlid fish radiation endemic to the East African Great Lakes. This project will characterize a newly discovered adaptive radiation involving Southeast Asian frogs, while allowing for a detailed study of biological diversification in an understudied region of the world.

This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering because it will advance data sharing and data interoperability across national boundaries.<br/><br/>This research will characterize in detail the diversification history of an as yet underappreciated putative adaptive radiation the Limnonectes fanged frogs of the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi and the adjacent Philippines Archipelago. This assemblage of ~40 species (most of which have not yet been formally named) exhibits many of the features that often characterize adaptive radiations. For example, Limnonectes exhibit more than 350-fold variation in adult body size, with lineages ranging in size from 2 grams to more than 700 grams, and many independent derivations of small, medium, large, and giant forms. Communities of six or more sympatric species occur throughout Sulawesi and the Philippines, and these species assemblages appear to partition microhabitats, exhibit phenotypes that correlate with microhabitat specializations, and vary dramatically in reproductive mode. This study will first establish a phylogenetic framework for this assemblage using an exome-capture Next-Generation Sequencing approach. In the context of this phylogeny, it will then provide analyses of body size evolution, test for correlations between phenotypic traits (both morphological and physiological) with microhabitat specializations, describe in detail the species by species reproductive diversity exemplified by this group, and provide an analysis of vocalization behavioral diversity. This research will be fully characterizing ecological drivers of this radiation, as well as the morphological, physiological, and life history features associated with the assemblage's remarkable diversification in insular Southeast Asia. This project will expand our breath of knowledge on how organisms take advantage of new ecological opportunities to diversify, and how adaptations of vast physiological differences between closely related species can evolve very quickly due to competition."

Understanding their evolutionary history can be critical to understanding their biology and potential for future change. Scientists currently use models to help infer this history, but most of these models ignore the reality of natural selection. This research proposal will develop models that allow scientists to estimate these histories while incorporating selection for certain amino acids into the models. These new models include parameters reflecting processes from population genetics, and will be used to infer the strength of selection on codon usage and amino acid sequence, sensitivity of protein function to different amino acid properties such as size and polarity, and mutation rates. These models fit empirical data far better than traditional models, and will more accurately infer evolutionary histories and processes. While the preliminary work uses amino acid sequences, the final project will use DNA sequences, allowing even greater resolution of evolutionary events. Given the importance of understanding evolutionary history and processes in fields ranging from medicine to forensics and from agriculture to basic taxonomy, the improvements in methods developed here will have great utility to both science and society.<br/><br/><br/>This research will create models linking mutation, drift, codon selection, and amino acid selection for use in phylogenetic inference. Rather than symmetric transition matrices derived from empirical estimates as used in the past, the models developed here will allow for twenty different transition matrices (one for each possible optimal amino acid) which allow for different rates of gain and loss between pairs of amino acids but which are generated from just a few, realistic parameters. The models developed here will be evaluated both for fit, using measures such as AIC, and adequacy, comparing them with each other and with standard models. Performance will be evaluated using multiple gene datasets from groups of organisms, ranging from a handful of genes to entire genomes, as well as from simulated genetic datasets. Preliminary analyses using a simplification of the proposed models show a dramatic improvement in model fit compared to traditional models. They also better match and predict empirical data, which is a standard test of model adequacy. Models will be incorporated into existing phylogenetics software via a hackathon including software developers. Outreach will include work with local teachers and development of a learning module for their high school classes."

They protect coastlines from storms and store carbon. They provide habitat and food for important fisheries. They also support tourism and local economies, and store freshwater for millions of people. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program addresses how and why coastal ecosystems are changing in response to sea level rise and the actions of people. Like many coastal ecosystems, the Florida Everglades are threatened by the diversion of freshwater to support urban and agricultural expansion. At the same time, sea level rise has caused coastal ecosystems to become saltier, threatening the freshwater supply, stressing freshwater plants, and causing the soils to collapse. When the soils beneath coastal wetlands disappear, seawater invades even more quickly. Researchers in the FCE LTER are continuing long-term studies and experiments to understand how these changes influence ecosystem functions and services. They are also developing tools for resource managers to create an effective freshwater restoration program. The science team includes an active community of graduate students. As a group, they reach the public through education and outreach activities, and regularly advise policy-makers on resource management decisions.<br/><br/>The FCE LTER research program addresses how changing fresh and marine supplies of water influence coastal ecosystem dynamics through: (i) continued long-term assessment of changes in biogeochemistry, primary production, organic matter, and trophic dynamics in ecosystems along freshwater-to-marine gradients, (ii) maintenance of existing in situ and ex situ long-term experiments, (iii) use of high-resolution remote sensing, coupled with models to forecast landscape-scale changes, (iv) addition of synoptic satellite sites to capture discrete spatio-temporal responses to episodic disturbance, and (v) initiation of new experimental manipulations to determine drivers and mechanisms of resilience to saltwater intrusion. Data syntheses integrate month-to-annual and inter-annual data into models of water, nutrients, carbon, and species dynamics throughout the Everglades landscape to compare how ecosystems with different productivities and carbon stores respond (maintain, increase, or decline) to short- (pulses) and long-term changes (presses) in hydrologic connectivity. Understanding and predicting the drivers of abrupt changes in ecosystems is a key challenge in ecosystem ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disease epidemics rarely end in the complete extinction of host populations. Especially in highly lethal diseases, theory predicts a shift away from the outbreak phase to a post-outbreak stage where hosts and pathogens persist in a shared environment. Such transitions in disease states present a moving target that limits the development of successful intervention strategies. This research investigates the factors that drive evolutionary shifts in disease dynamics by focusing on one of the most devastating infectious diseases of vertebrates in recorded history, amphibian chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungal pathogen that can spread rapidly through amphibian populations and cause extremely high levels of mortality, suggesting that it is a strong agent of natural selection. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators are using an in-depth understanding of chytridiomycosis to develop science-based conservation strategies. The research is integrated with educational outreach, including public workshops and presentations centered on the annual International Save the Frogs Day. <br/><br/>This research capitalizes on a decade of research in Central America and on an unprecedented archive of disease data, pathogen isolates, and host samples. Pathogen isolates and host samples were collected and archived during the outbreak phase of the disease and similar data are being collected during the endemic phase, beginning eight to ten years later. The researchers are using experimental and molecular methods to investigate the hypotheses that (1) the level of pathogen virulence has shifted since the original outbreaks and (2) that hosts have evolved to be more tolerant of infection. To test these hypotheses, the investigators are testing the historic and contemporary samples to identify phenotypic and genetic differences linked to pathogen virulence host immune defenses. The results will provide insights for safeguarding amphibian biodiversity and for understanding the role of evolution in shaping post-epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases."

The rare and high reproduction ""mast"" years have cascading effects on food webs within ecosystems, as seeds are a food source for a variety of bird, mammal, and insect species. Evolutionarily, it is thought that this pattern of producing low numbers of seeds for several years, followed by a mast year is a way to keep seed predator populations low, in order to have higher chances for seeds to establish. Another hypothesis is that individuals reproducing at the same time will have higher pollination efficiency, which will lead to more seeds being produced. The critical components of mast seeding are years with high reproduction followed by years with low seeding, and all individuals in the same region doing the same thing. Although studies of individuals in masting populations are rare, some have shown considerable variation in reproductive patterns within a population. Some individuals do not mast at the same time as the rest of the population.  This project will build on a unique individual-based dataset of hundreds of white spruce trees to investigate patterns of reproduction by individual plants, and to test the consequences for individuals that have different patterns of reproduction from others in their population. Understanding fluctuations in plant reproductive investment is a key challenge in ecology, conservation, and management. White spruce is an economically valuable species, and this project may have consequences for its management. Additionally, both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in science and communication. <br/><br/>Individual variation has impacts on population and community stability, and individual variation in mast seeding has relevance to forest regeneration and higher ecological levels of organization. Field data will be collected on annual cone production from ~900 trees, extending an existing dataset to eight years. Cones from a subset of trees will be assessed for cone size, seed number, and germination success to test fitness consequences of reproductive patterns relative to when high reproduction occurs locally. Resource allocation and mast seeding will also be examined in the context of surviving an insect attack. Growth and reproduction of individual trees leading up to an insect outbreak will be measured, to test if individuals that allocated energy differently from the population have a higher likelihood of survival. This project will provide empirical data, new insights, and a novel approach into understanding the magnitude of individual variation and its consequences in a mast seeding system."

This project will test alternative hypotheses that have been proposed to explain declines in specialist herbivores from fragmented forests. This research is important in understanding how changes in land use or other disturbances that fragment habitats will affect biodiversity and the integrity of ecosystems.  The project will focus on butterfly larvae of species with different diet requirements as model study organisms.  Their dependence on particular plant species and their role as prey for birds will be studied in 40 forest sites in Connecticut where the basic ecological interactions are well known.  In addition to analysis of response to past forest fragmentation, experiments protecting caterpillars from predation will help quantify the importance of food resources.  The study will improve understanding of natural food webs subject to human impacts and can guide future forest management.  This project will also provide research training for students in forest ecology that will strengthen the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>Forest fragmentation is likely to substantially modify interactions among species, and a recurrent pattern is the loss of dietary specialists from food webs in small forest fragments.  Focusing on a complex, tri-trophic ecological network of larval Lepidoptera, their hostplants, and avian predators, the project will establish how bottom-up and top-down mechanisms alter the absolute and relative abundance of specialist herbivores in forest fragments. The project will combine extensive extant data on plant-Lepidoptera associations and regional forest fragmentation, new data on plants and caterpillars at 40 sites, field experiments, and lab analyses on caterpillar diet breadth and growth response, to quantify effects of host plant availability and predation on the diet specificity of lepidopteran larvae in temperate deciduous forests. This detailed, multi-trophic approach will enhance mechanistic understanding of changes in trophic networks due to fragmentation.  Four broader impacts will result from this work: 1) training future scientists, 2) recruiting underrepresented groups, 3) public outreach in science and 4) improving scientific infrastructure."

With the advent of genomics, it is now possible to study this remarkable evolutionary change at the molecular level. In this project, researchers will document the genetic basis of traits that were altered in the evolutionary genesis of these secondarily aquatic mammals and trace the molecular changes that produced a modern whale. In this project, researchers will train a postdoctoral scholar, graduate students, and multiple undergraduate interns at UC Riverside, a minority serving institution. The ethnically diverse makeup of UC Riverside provides an opportunity to bring cutting edge research to students who are historically underrepresented in science. Results from the research also will be incorporated into coursework and provide content for museum displays focused on evolutionary principles. Grant participants, including students, will collaborate with staff at the San Diego Natural History Museum to relate exciting research breakthroughs in a revitalized 'Fossil Mysteries' exhibit with bilingual educational modules.<br/><br/>For Cetacea, standard phylogenetic analyses of fossil and molecular data have been used to reconstruct major phenotypic transformations in the group, with fossils providing signposts that place key evolutionary innovations relative to Earth history.  Yet, despite ongoing phylogenetic studies based on large datasets, a fully resolved reconstruction of cetacean evolution has been elusive. The researchers propose a three-pronged approach to an enhanced study of cetacean evolutionary history that will utilize >500 genes to: 1) compare alternate approaches to the reconstruction of species trees using a robust sample of genetic data, 2) resolve problematic systematic relationships within Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins), Phocoenidae (porpoises), and Balaenopteroidea (rorquals and gray whale), 3) synthesize a phylogenomic blueprint for modern cetaceans.  Exon capture and next generation sequencing methods will be employed to rapidly characterize candidate loci that represent genes predicted to have undergone adaptive or degenerative change. The researchers will target genes that are critical for behavioral and anatomical features that are highly derived in the group, including loci implicated in vision, hearing, olfaction, deep diving, aging, tooth development, baleen formation, and brain size.  The end result will be the first, detailed, genomic characterization of a major macroevolutionary transition that is also documented by extensive fossil evidence."

The actions of hormones can range from the control of blood glucose levels to the transformation of a tadpole into a frog. The fundamental biological roles of hormones in diverse processes suggest that they have been important in shaping animal form and function. However, the dynamic nature of hormones and their varying responses has presented challenges to understanding how alterations to the endocrine system have impacted animal evolution. This study utilizes a group of salamanders that vary in sensitivity to thyroid hormone to test how changes to the endocrine system influence patterns of evolution at different levels of organization. Mechanisms of hormone action are a fundamental part of animal systems, and are important at many levels of science education. This project will include curriculum development in organismal biology and evolution for secondary education, as well as undergraduate and graduate-level training in conducting integrative biology research. This research will fund two professional development workshops in comparative and molecular endocrinology for Oklahoma educators. <br/><br/>This research will provide a compelling test of the consequences of endocrine system evolution on phenotypic, transcriptomic, and genomic diversification. It will also serve as a model for analyzing the evolution of dynamic traits. Even though all salamanders utilize thyroid hormone for at least some functions, in some paedomorphic species thyroid hormone has become dysregulated from metamorphosis. This research will use the multiple independent losses of thyroid hormone controlled metamorphosis in salamanders to test how hormone dysregulation influences patterns of morphological, transcriptomic, and genomic diversification. Experimental treatment with thyroid hormone will be used to test for differences in tissue sensitivity among the larvae of biphasic and larval form paedomorphic salamanders. Morphological and transcriptomic data from the experiment, as well as genomic data, will be used to evaluate rates of evolution across different levels of organization. The prediction is that thyroid hormone regulation should constrain evolution, while dysregulation of this endocrine signal should promote diversification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disease epidemics rarely end in the complete extinction of host populations. Especially in highly lethal diseases, theory predicts a shift away from the outbreak phase to a post-outbreak stage where hosts and pathogens persist in a shared environment. Such transitions in disease states present a moving target that limits the development of successful intervention strategies. This research investigates the factors that drive evolutionary shifts in disease dynamics by focusing on one of the most devastating infectious diseases of vertebrates in recorded history, amphibian chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungal pathogen that can spread rapidly through amphibian populations and cause extremely high levels of mortality, suggesting that it is a strong agent of natural selection. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators are using an in-depth understanding of chytridiomycosis to develop science-based conservation strategies. The research is integrated with educational outreach, including public workshops and presentations centered on the annual International Save the Frogs Day. <br/><br/>This research capitalizes on a decade of research in Central America and on an unprecedented archive of disease data, pathogen isolates, and host samples. Pathogen isolates and host samples were collected and archived during the outbreak phase of the disease and similar data are being collected during the endemic phase, beginning eight to ten years later. The researchers are using experimental and molecular methods to investigate the hypotheses that (1) the level of pathogen virulence has shifted since the original outbreaks and (2) that hosts have evolved to be more tolerant of infection. To test these hypotheses, the investigators are testing the historic and contemporary samples to identify phenotypic and genetic differences linked to pathogen virulence host immune defenses. The results will provide insights for safeguarding amphibian biodiversity and for understanding the role of evolution in shaping post-epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases."

However, the short- and long-term consequences of genome duplication in wild plants are not well understood. This research will investigate the natural rate of genome duplication in a wild moss species distributed in North America and Europe. Researchers will create experimental, genome-duplicated offspring in the laboratory to measure how their morphology and reproduction differs from that of their parents.

Most studies of biological responses to environmental change have either documented the natural pattern of whole-species response to past change or, alternatively, the effects of experimentally manipulated environment on the performance of a few individuals. The former approach benefits from its realism, but is too coarse to elucidate the physiological responses underlying the response to changes in climate. The latter approach demonstrates these mechanisms in detail, but does so at small spatial scales and under artificially simplified experimental conditions. This study seeks to bridge these two approaches, studying the responses of the plant Valeriana edulis to climatic variation at field sites in the Colorado Rockies. Individuals of this species have separate sexes (i.e. are either male or female) and the sexes respond differently to changes in climate.  The researchers will investigate how these variable, individual-level responses to climate scale up to determine population dynamics and species persistence. This work will be conducted at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) using historic and contemporary demographic data to compare the effects of a changing climate over space (an 1800 m elevational gradient), between experimental manipulations (warming and snow removal), and over time (40 year record).  This study also provides opportunities for education and outreach through undergraduate and graduate scientific training, citizen science initiatives, and through the development of web-based curricula in collaboration with the RMBL.<br/><br/>This research asks whether the sex-mediated physiological response of males and females in dioecious species to changes in climate can skew population structure (sex ratios) with resultant demographic consequences.

Once trees die, wood-containing carbon is consumed by organisms such as microbes and insects. Such carbon can be emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane gas. Additionally, only some microbes can break down lignin, a critical building block of wood. When they are unable to do so, remaining lignin gets locked in soil. The tropics have vast stores of carbon in trees but little is known about where that carbon ends up. Both microbes and termites consume tropical wood, but which one does the job alters how fast and in what form carbon is released. Typically, microbes need lots of moisture to thrive on wood, but termites may require less since they can hide in their nest mounds and store water if it becomes too dry. Scientists have been trying to model global carbon cycling under environmental change, but they have yet to include the decay of wood by microbes and insects in their studies. The researchers on this study predict that these organisms have an enormous impact on global carbon cycling. The experimental field work will cut across ecosystems with varying rainfall in Queensland, Australia, from wet rainforest to dry savanna. At these different sites, the researchers will compare how fast termites versus microbes consume the wood and what gases are released during wet and dry seasons. The results will be incorporated into computer models to determine how termites and microbes affect carbon cycling at regional to global scales. Such information will be fed back to the scientific community to make better predictions about the global carbon cycle. This project is an international collaboration between scientists in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, and is supported, in part, by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering. Additionally, workshops will bring together project scientists with forestry stakeholders to develop potential strategies for preventing the decay of carbon in wood, and reducing natural carbon emissions. The project will also support education and training of junior scientists. <br/><br/>Three questions will be addressed in this project: Q1. What controls rates of coarse wood debris carbon turnover? Turnover rates will be determined by measuring termite and microbe activity, which are dependent on climate and wood construction. Wetter conditions should increase turnover, but termites should increase turnover relatively more in dry conditions due to their water conservation strategies. Dense, highly lignified wood should decay more slowly. Q2. What controls fates of carbon liberated from coarse wood debris? Carbon fates (carbon dioxide, methane, soil organic residues) will depend on the stage of wood decay and the composition of termite and microbial communities. Later stages of decay, increased abundance or activity of methanogenic archaea, (or decreased bacterial methanotropy) and changes in termite species should result in greater methane/carbon dioxide ratios. Greater organic residue formation is predicted to occur when carbon loss is via termites. Q3. How do mechanisms of wood turnover scale up to affect ecosystem-level carbon fluxes under environmental change? To date, coarse wood debris is poorly parameterized in Earth system models (e.g., coarse wood debris is assumed to decay only via physical fragmentation). Field data from Q1 and Q2 will be used to drive new predictive models of wood turnover and gas emission under environmental change. To test Q1 and determine relative wood-associated microbe and termite decay rates in response to precipitation variation, blocks of pine known to attract termites will be placed at six sites. Blocks will be enclosed in fine-mesh with or without holes to limit termite access. Blocks will be harvested at the end of wet and dry seasons for four years. To determine the influence of wood construction on decay, replicate logs of ten species/site will be placed at rainforest and savannah sites. Logs will be harvested at the end of wet and dry seasons. For logs/blocks, initial and final mass, density and chemistry will be measured. To test Q2, wood subsamples and termites in wood will be collected to determine termite community, microbial community and decay gene composition, and organic residue formation. Carbon dioxide and methane will be measured for harvested logs/blocks. As some termites live in mound nests, experimental mounds will be established and carbon dioxide and methane fluxes will be measured in mounds in a one-year experiment. To test Q3, field data will be incorporated into woodCLM, an ecosystem model derived from the Community Land Model. Results from the modified and original models will be compared. Using woodCLM, wood dynamics and gas emissions will be simulated under future environmental scenarios at the sites.  The project will include training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels, and is part of an international collaborative effort with scientists in England funded by the United Kingdom's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)."

The farming of fungi has evolved in at least 12 different bark beetle groups, and these groups have radiated into more than 3,500 species. Despite the evolutionary success of this relationship, estimates suggest that the identity of the fungal symbiont is unknown for over 90% of beetles. Global movement of wood products has made many ambrosia beetles invasive, and many of the symbiotic fungi have become pathogens to tree crops. This project will document the ambrosia beetle-fungal symbiosis and characterize the fungal community for each ambrosia beetle genus using new molecular and culturing techniques. Two graduate students will be trained in field and laboratory techniques. The project will also disseminate research findings through an exhibit of beetle calligraphy at the Harn Museum of Modern Art in Gainesville, FL, and a national citizen science project entitled 'Backyard Bark Beetles'. Researchers will also enhance international collaboration and infrastructure by running an ambrosia beetle identification workshop in tropical Asia to help inspectors identify the most invasive species.<br/><br/>The first aim of this project is to comprehensively sample ambrosia beetle-fungal symbioses to investigate the level of symbiont specificity. Three globally-invasive ambrosia beetle-fungus complexes will then be sampled to investigate how the fungal symbiont community has changed over time following vector dispersal, invasion, and contact with new communities. The third and ultimate goal of the project is to use phylogenetic and comparative methods to reconstruct the pattern of ambrosia beetle-fungus coevolution. With new data on fungus communities, it will be possible to compare the influence of beetle phylogeny, geographic origin, latitude and other factors on beetle-fungus relationships. This project will implement a series of methods to achieve the research goals, including high-throughput DNA metabarcoding, a new 'RNA metabarcoding' approach to investigate fungal metabolic prominence, and a RADseq-based approach to reconstruct population genetic history, Together, this research will produce a comprehensive dataset on the identity and movements of ambrosia and their fungal symbionts in both their native and invaded regions that will provide essential baseline data to help control the global impact of both ambrosia beetles and ambrosia fungi."

Pollinators are major players in both wild and agricultural systems, as over 87% of flowering plants require pollinators in order to reproduce. Flowers are sites of interaction between plants and their pollinators, wherein pollinators receive nectar or pollen in exchange for pollination. Each flower receives multiple visits from not only multiple individuals but often multiple types of pollinators. Because many individuals feed from the same floral resource, flowers can also be sites for passing pathogens from pollinator to pollinator. Studying bees and hummingbirds, this project examines these interactions?how pollinator visits to the flower underlie regional and continental patterns of interactions among plants, pollinators, and their pathogens. This project investigates an emerging area of biology and evaluates the potential for inter-specific pathogen transmission. Furthermore, the research contributes to our understanding of how large-scale processes (biological invasion, climate change and pollinator migration) affect interactions among plants, their pollinators and their pathogens. With such information, we can make predictions and devise strategies to maintain and protect the pollination services necessary for a healthy and stable environment. In addition to promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math undergraduates by providing meaningful research opportunities, the researchers are developing educational materials that feature local species, habitats, and guided journaling activities for K-6 students to explore their relationship with the natural world and pollinators in particular.<br/><br/>The project examines interactions at the floral interface?how local foraging of pollinators at the flower scale up to drive regional and continental patterns of plant-pollinator-pathogen networks. Floral resources are utilized by a broad range of species, including both hummingbirds and bees. Each floral visit presents the opportunity for a pollinator to both obtain and transfer pathogens. This project integrates pollination biology, behavioral ecology, migration behavior, and disease ecology. Quantitative network models will be developed by combining phenology, plant diversity and abundance data with experimental, spatially replicated data on species interactions generated from direct observations and next-generation sequencing. In a novel approach, researchers will then incorporate plant-pollinator and pollinator-pathogen interactions to create plant-pollinator-pathogen networks. This permits detailed study of how pollinator foraging patterns influence pathogen transmission at the regional and continental scales and how pathogen transmission is affected by invasive floral visitors and migration. The resulting networks will be documented across a large geographic area comprising a global biodiversity hotspot, the California Floristic Province, which also experiences annual continental-scale migrations. The main project objectives are to examine how fluctuations in floral visitation due to various anthropogenic causes affect pathways of pollinator pathogen transmission. In particular, the effects of species introductions, migration, and climate change will be examined. Such a synthesis will provide insights and new understanding into the pathways of florally-transmitted pathogens and disease."

Most studies of recent climate change on species' geographic ranges are based on projections from computer models rather than measured responses from field studies. This research takes a very different and multi-tiered approach by using historical records and specimens with the necessary precision, geographic and temporal scale, and magnitude of observed climate change to produce important insights into the direct and indirect effects of climatic and nonclimatic factors on changes in species' geographic distributions. This research will resurvey field sites in the southwest United States last surveyed more than 70 years ago, which will not only advance our understanding of environmental changes but will establish a new benchmark for comparison of future changes. Federal land-management agencies will benefit from greater knowledge of the status of sensitive species and wildlife responses to climate change. Specimens and audio recordings collected will be available for ancillary studies. Results will be extended broadly to the public through talks, popular press and media, and museum displays, including new exhibits of the San Diego Natural History Museum and the Oakland Museum of California. The National Park Service Science and Education Office will distribute results widely through videos and podcasts to train their interpreters on the biological effects of environmental change and to provide interpretive materials for their visitor centers. Undergraduates, graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will participate in this study, learning field and lab techniques, natural history, physiological methods and modeling. Results and data will be shared with scientists and the general public through websites and online databases. <br/><br/>This project will resurvey sites that were sampled from 1908-1945 to examine the impact of 20th century climate change on small mammal and bird communities in Sonoran, Mojave, and Great Basin deserts. These areas have warmed greatly over the last 50 years, with the average annual temperatures increasing up to 2C. The research will advance understanding of animal responses to climate change by: developing new models that mechanistically project species' ranges by linking climate through important physiological thresholds of temperature and water stress; developing novel tests to examine whether climate change results in species shifting their geographic ranges individually or whether whole communities of species shift similarly; and testing if body sizes and diets of species have responded to climate change. Birds and mammals will be resurveyed at 105 sites. Both audio and physical voucher specimens will be collected and made available for future reanalysis. Standard morphological data will be collected for birds and mammal skulls. Ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be measured from tissues. Multispecies occupancy models will account for detectability in historical and current surveys to develop unbiased estimators of local colonization and extinction of species and changes in community composition in response to site-level characteristics. Measures of thermal and hydric stress at and above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone will be made for 12 species of mammals to develop models of heat stress that can be validated."

They occur in high mountain areas in North America, and little is known about their biology and evolution. Because of their unique habit of living in areas near alpine glaciers, which constantly expand and retract, ice-crawlers are a natural model to study the long-term consequences of climate variation. This research will explore two major, and so far largely unanswered questions: How does climate influence the diversity and diversification of species? And: How do species change their physiological tolerance in response to climate over time? Results from this research will greatly increase our general understanding of adaptive responses of species to changing environments. This research will be complemented by outreach efforts to the public at U.S. National Parks, the training of high school and university students, as well as the development of inquiry-based science curricula involving insects that may be implemented in middle schools.<br/><br/>The scientific aim of this proposal is to test the importance of geographical isolation and climatic niche evolution in the generation of montane biodiversity, thus advancing knowledge of the mechanisms that generate high levels of endemism in montane ecosystems. Montane lineage diversity increased in response to Pliocene-Pleistocene glaciations, but it is not clear whether climatic niche evolution played a role in the persistence and diversification of montane taxa. Indeed, geographical isolation and niche conservatism are considered the primary mechanisms of climate-driven lineage diversification in montane regions. This proposed research would collect genomic data and provide a comprehensive phylogeny for the entire insect order Grylloblattodea, an understudied lineage in the insect tree of life. Additionally, biogeographic and diversification rate analyses would test the role of climate fluctuations in generating ice-crawler diversity. Ecophysiological data, including thermal tolerance, thermal preference, and water loss rates, will be compared in taxon pairs occurring in sympatry, across environmental gradients, and in allopatry. Collectively, these analyses will test whether niche evolution, as opposed to phylogenetic conservatism, contribute to montane diversity. This research would make progress on a major goal of evolutionary and ecological research, that is to understand how rates of ecological divergence vary across regions and taxonomic groups, as well as the conditions under which lineages undergo adaptive radiations.

Well-characterized adaptive radiations are relatively rare, and tend to be studied intensively by organismal biologists once they have become established as model systems for study. Examples of classical adaptive radiations include Darwin's Finches, the Hawaiian Silversword alliance of plants, and the cichlid fish radiation endemic to the East African Great Lakes. This project will characterize a newly discovered adaptive radiation involving Southeast Asian frogs, while allowing for a detailed study of biological diversification in an understudied region of the world.  The researchers will promote STEM engagement of underrepresented minorities, especially students and early-career researchers. This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science and Engineering because it will advance data sharing and data interoperability across national boundaries.<br/><br/>This research will characterize in detail the diversification history of an as yet underappreciated putative adaptive radiation the Limnonectes fanged frogs of the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi and the adjacent Philippines Archipelago. This assemblage of ~40 species (most of which have not yet been formally named) exhibits many of the features that often characterize adaptive radiations. For example, Limnonectes exhibit more than 350-fold variation in adult body size, with lineages ranging in size from 2 grams to more than 700 grams, and many independent derivations of small, medium, large, and giant forms. Communities of six or more sympatric species occur throughout Sulawesi and the Philippines, and these species assemblages appear to partition microhabitats, exhibit phenotypes that correlate with microhabitat specializations, and vary dramatically in reproductive mode. This study will first establish a phylogenetic framework for this assemblage using an exome-capture Next-Generation Sequencing approach. In the context of this phylogeny, it will then provide analyses of body size evolution, test for correlations between phenotypic traits (both morphological and physiological) with microhabitat specializations, describe in detail the species by species reproductive diversity exemplified by this group, and provide an analysis of vocalization behavioral diversity. This research will be fully characterizing ecological drivers of this radiation, as well as the morphological, physiological, and life history features associated with the assemblage's remarkable diversification in insular Southeast Asia. This project will expand our breath of knowledge on how organisms take advantage of new ecological opportunities to diversify, and how adaptations of vast physiological differences between closely related species can evolve very quickly due to competition."

In addition to analysis of response to past forest fragmentation, experiments protecting caterpillars from predation will help quantify the importance of food resources.  The study will improve understanding of natural food webs subject to human impacts and can guide future forest management.

These models are aimed at long-term predictions of focal species population growth under experimental conditions to determine their viability in a competitive environment altered by increased temperatures. This project will generalize these results to a wider set of systems and species. The researchers will collect plant trait and environmental data on focal species and competing communities to parameterize a new trait-based model aimed at predicting competitive interaction outcomes from differences in species traits.

They perform critical ecological functions such as soil stability and water purification in many ecosystems. The lichen genus Sticta performs an important function in forest and woodland ecosystems in temperate and tropical regions. Due to their large size and capacity to store and release large amounts of water, these lichens contribute to the water cycle, including in regions that are water reservoirs for urban areas. Most species contain cyanobacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen and thus function as biological fertilizers. Sticta species are particularly sensitive indicators of ecological disturbance, air pollution and global climate change, and have therefore disappeared from many habitats over vast geographical regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Although Sticta includes 120 species, genetic data suggest that perhaps as many as 400 species await discovery throughout the world, particularly in tropical mountains. An international team of researchers seeks to fully elucidate Sticta diversity using modern genomic approaches, and reconstruct its evolutionary history to further our understanding of the role of global climatic shifts and geological events on the diversification of these symbiotic fungi.  This knowledge is critical in understanding and conserving their important ecological roles they play for our society.  The project also contains components of citizen science and outreach materials aimed at public education and ecotourism.<br/><br/>This project brings together a broad array of tools to elucidate the evolution and diversification of Sticta within a framework of historical biogeography, including a combination of traditional and next-generation DNA sequencing methods to test the viability of DNA barcoding for a large lichen fungal genus. The research will begin with targeted collection of Sticta specimens which will be used for DNA sequence and morphological analyses. Using phylogenetic methods the project will infer species delimitations, divergence dates among lineages, biogeography, ecological niche and morphological character state reconstructions. Novel approaches that effectively integrate molecular and morphological data are implemented. This includes morphology-based phylogenetic binning to place historical type specimens within the molecular phylogeny.  These tools will resolve the biodiversity questions within Sticta and generate tools essential to their identification.  The evolution of phenotypes and photosymbiodemes (lichens that include two different types of photobionts) and their importance for the understanding of morphogenesis and interactions of fungal and algal or cyanobacterial partners in lichens will be studied.

Ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, are marine predators found in all oceans, inhabiting both deep and shallow seas. Although fragile and difficult to study, they are biologically important, in part because they appear to have been the first group of animals to split off from all other organisms during evolution, even before sponges and jellyfish. Over evolutionary time, many marine organisms have transitioned their home ranges to and from the deep sea despite the tremendous differences between these two habitats, including light, temperature, and hydrostatic pressure. Such habitat shifts required dramatic genetic and physiological changes to these animal lineages over time. The relationships between comb jelly species indicate that species from a variety of different families have evolved to live and thrive in the deep sea. This project will compare closely related deep and shallow species at biochemical, physiological and genetic levels to understand how these transitions came about. It will answer questions about the fundamental mechanisms of animal evolution and develop publicly available tools for analyzing genomic data sets. It will result in the training of cutting-edge techniques for two PhD students, a postdoc, two masters students, and numerous undergraduates. Public outreach involving biodiversity in the deep sea and gelatinous animals will help educate and inspire appreciation of marine life.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to understand evolution and diversification using cutting edge molecular analyses to investigate the deep-sea habitat as the generating force of novel biological adaptations. Ctenophore specimens will be collected using blue-water SCUBA in surface waters and remotely operated submarines in the deep sea to generate complementary physiological and genomic data across the full phylogenetic and functional diversity of ctenophores. With samples taken across a range of habitats from shallow tropical waters to temperate bathypelagic zone, the team will measure physiological capabilities and sequence transcriptomes and genomes. This project will develop novel algorithms to identify genes involved in depth adaptation and examine the genetic events that underlie physiological tolerances and adaptations to high hydrostatic pressures in the deep sea. To confirm the theory-based predictions of how gene sequence affects the properties of enzymes, proteins will be expressed and characterized in the lab. Collaborations between the students, postdocs and PIs involved in this project will substantially enhance an interdisciplinary workforce trained in both classical and cutting edge skills needed for contemporary biodiversity investigations."

Ongoing excavation of the site, an ancient sinkhole deposit discovered in 2000, has yielded numerous, well-preserved fossils of terrestrial plants and animals that lived approximately seven to four-and-a-half million years ago. The vegetation of this time period in the Appalachian region is significant because it predates the widespread ecological disturbance caused by Pleistocene-age environmental changes, yet its biodiversity is not well understood. Consequently, the Gray Fossil Site presents a unique opportunity to clarify how ecosystems of the Appalachian region have changed over recent geological history. Researchers will identify species of fossil fruits and seeds from the site and will describe those new to science. They will then compare the diversity of fossil plant species found at the site to that of other ancient and modern plants world-wide. The comparison may provide transformative insights regarding the pace of biological diversification, extinction, and geographic range shifts of plant species at a local to global scale. Researchers will train undergraduate students and engage the public at the Gray Fossil Site and Museum by producing a digital visitor's guide to the fossil flora. Research results will be disseminated widely and will include contributions to the NSF-funded, open access Digital Atlas of Ancient Life.<br/><br/>This project will create the first comprehensive carpoflora for the Gray Fossil Site. Researchers will analyze previously excavated fruit and seed fossils using a combination of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. These methods supply complementary data that characterize both surface morphological and internal anatomical details without the need for destructive dissection. Project personnel will determine the systematic affinities of the fossils using structural characteristics and phylogenetic analyses, where feasible. They will then assess the biogeographic relationships of the carpoflora based on the taxonomy of the fossils. These data will test the hypothesis that the carpoflora will share greatest similarities to the ancient and modern floras of Eurasia and North America. Outcomes of this project will include an improved understanding of Miocene and Pliocene ecosystems of North America, the historical biogeography of the Appalachian flora, and the state of internal anatomical preservation of the Gray Fossil Site carpoflora.

The Mara River is the only permanent source of water for wildlife and is therefore considered the 'life blood' of the Serengeti. This proposal focuses on the effects of nutrient addition to the river ecosystem from natural and exceedingly large inputs of nutrients from hippopotamus and wildebeest. The key question is how do large and irregularly timed nutrient inputs affect the way river ecosystems function? This project will conduct a series of experiments in the Mara river system to address this question. Results of this project will produce estimates of the distribution and abundance of hippos, and the location and magnitude of wildebeest drowning events that will provide important information for the management of hippos and wildebeest in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem. Hippos and wildebeest are extremely important to the tourism economy of Kenya and Tanzania and are species of considerable conservation concern. A collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya will provide important data on the diversity and biomass of insects and fish in the Mara River. This project will train a postdoctoral associate, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students, and broaden participation of under-represented groups in science by involving underrepresented minority undergraduate students in summer research. This project will also provide field-based short courses in Kenya for US students. Finally, results from this research will be shared with global audiences through web-based outreach initiatives using real-time discharge data, live photo streams from the field, and Twitter and blog updates.<br/><br/>The movement of energy, materials, and organisms across ecosystem boundaries is a common feature of many landscapes. These spatial subsidies have strong but variable effects on communities and ecosystems. The magnitude of spatial subsidies may be one of the most important drivers of the variability in community and ecosystem level effects. Theory suggests that low levels of inputs stabilize food webs and increase community persistence, particularly when complementing patterns of local productivity, and high levels of inputs decrease food web stability and increase the strength of trophic cascades. Very little empirical research has addressed the impacts of the magnitude of subsidies, raising the central question of this proposal: how does the magnitude of subsidies influence community and ecosystem processes? The Mara River sustains the largest remaining overland migration of around 1.2 million wildebeest and a population of over 4,000 hippopotamus (hippos). Hippos, through excretion and egestion during daily feeding migrations, and wildebeest, through carcass inputs during mass drownings, create a natural gradient of increasing subsidy inputs from upstream to downstream in the Mara River. This project utilizes basin-wide comparisons, in situ comparative experiments, and small-scale artificial stream experiments to test how the magnitude of spatial subsidies influences primary and secondary production, the strength of trophic cascades, and food web stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The southeastern United States has recently experienced the most extreme drought in at least 10 years.  Alabama has been particularly hard hit, with nearly 98% of the state being directly affected by drought conditions.  The lack of rainfall during Fall 2016 reduced many streams to trickles while others have completely dried; major rivers reached low levels not seen in over 60 years. Alabama is known as a global biodiversity hotspot for freshwater species of fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. Many of these species are threatened, endangered, and/or found nowhere else on Earth. This study seeks to determine the role of downstream refuges on the effect of intense droughts in aquatic ecosystems with high species diversity. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine changes in species composition in response to intense drought, 2) Identify habitat offering critical refuge from the drought to species with different movement abilities, 3) Build a predictive model of the effects of intense drought and future recovery at local and regional scales. Two graduate students and several undergraduates will be involved in the sampling and research activities of the study. This research will provide management tools to identify and protect Alabama Strategic Habitat Units. The study also will offer summer camps for middle-school students and public outreach activities to citizen science groups organized with collaboration of the Auburn University Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>The study will assess the impacts of extreme drought on the dynamics of habitat use as well as evaluate the resilience of aquatic species to flash drought. The investigators hypothesize that the ability to use downstream refuge during drought is a bottleneck that varies based on species vagility and position in the stream network. Stream habitats in two drainages that have experienced the exceptional drought will be sampled and compared to historic, baseline data collected since 2012 to test this hypothesis. The study will predict shifts in distribution patterns of stream fauna in response to flash drought by combining pre-drought survey and environmental DNA (eDNA) data from streams of various sizes in two ecoregions of Alabama, with species-specific vagility potential based on functional trait databases, life history information, and professional judgment. Predicted and observed patterns will be compared using fine scale surveys, broad scale eDNA collections, and spatial analysis. The results of this investigation will provide critical information pertinent to understanding the resiliency of specific taxa and stream communities in general to drought disturbance in a global hotspot for diversity."

In this research, researchers will use the new method to test whether changes in climate and sea levels over the past 25 million years have contributed to the generation of the rich biodiversity of Southeast Asia. This project will have far-reaching societal benefits by providing educational opportunities to the under-served prison population. To initiate the incorporation of more STEM courses into the curriculum of the Alabama Prison + Arts Education Project, the researchers will develop and teach a 14-week evolutionary biology course to prisoners in Alabama. To maximize the reproducibility, transparency, and utility of the research and educational aspects of this project, the researchers will follow open-science principles by using software to record their progress in real time and make it publicly available on the Internet. <br/><br/>The first aim of this project is to develop a general statistical framework for inferring evolutionary relationships that allows for (1) lineages to diverge into more than two descendant lineages (multifurcations) and (2) two or more lineages to diverge at the same time in the past (co-divergences). To do this, the researchers will develop a class of probability distributions over the entire space of possible evolutionary relationships, including multifurcations and co-divergences, and a numerical approach to explore this space while estimating the relationships among genes, organisms, or populations. The second aim of this project is to use extensive computer simulations to assess how well the method performs across a broad range of conditions. Of particular interest is determining how much the new method improves the accuracy and precision of phylogenetic inference when multifurcations and co-divergences occur in the simulations, and whether there is a cost to using the new method when they do not occur. The third aim of the project is to infer more precisely how historical changes to the landscape of Southeast Asia have contributed to the rich biodiversity of this region. To address this question, the researchers will extract genomic data from specimens of three genera of geckos distributed across Southeast Asia, and apply their new method to these data. This will allow the researchers to estimate the probability of temporal patterns of divergence during the evolutionary history of these geckos that are predicted by past changes to the landscape. The new methods being generated will allow biologists to see and modify the Tree of Life in a new framework with a more realistic sequence of ancestral/descendant relationships including cases where more than two descendants evolve from a single ancestor."

Endophytic fungi are one of the most diverse groups of fungi yet remain poorly known overall. A critical barrier to understanding how endophytic fungi evolve is the lack of a well-characterized model endophyte species and a foundation of basic knowledge about its biology, global distribution, evolutionary history and genome characteristics. The goal of this project is to develop this foundational knowledge for the most common endophytic fungus of pine trees, the genus Lophodermium. Researchers will use phylogenetic and comparative genomic methods to test how the endophytic species have diversified in relation to their plant hosts and their environment. Results will lead to the discovery and description of endophytic fungal species new to science and new techniques that will accelerate the characterization of others. Broader impacts of the research will yield new insights for conserving cryptic biodiversity and facilitate the discovery of novel fungal biochemicals, such as antibiotics and enzymes for biofuel production. Researchers will train graduate and undergraduate students, including members of under-represented groups, in diverse disciplines ranging from evolutionary ecology and bioinformatics to molecular engineering. <br/><br/>This project will generate the first integrative, global phylogenomic study of Lophodermium (ca. 100 species; Class Leotiomycetes, Phylum Ascomycota) to understand the diversity and specificity of the plant-endophyte symbiotic interaction. This research will address fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions concerning the origin and diversification of fungal endophyte species, specifically addressing how adaptations to different plant host species may lead to the speciation of endophytes. Genomic and transcriptomic data of diverse Lophodermium species will be generated to help identify underlying molecular signatures that have contributed to speciation and adaptation to Pinus host species. The project will also develop tools, such as in situ fluorescence probes, and cyber-platforms that will transform the current approach to exploring, analyzing and synthesizing the life history of cryptic endophytes.

However, it is not known whether the amount of organic matter in soils will change in proportion to changes in litter inputs, or whether there might be non-linear interactions that may lead to disproportional soil changes.  Understanding processes that increase or decrease soil organic matter is critical for understanding the global carbon balance, as carbon in soil organic matter amounts to more than the carbon stored in plant mass and in the atmosphere combined. The flux of carbon between soils and the atmosphere is also large, with the annual amount of carbon released from soils about 10 times that due to fossil fuel combustion.  The DIRT (Detrital Inputs and Removal Treatments) experiment, started at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon in 1997, is a long-term study where litter is manipulated either by increasing above-ground wood inputs, eliminating aboveground inputs, eliminating belowground (root) inputs, or eliminating both above- and belowground inputs.  The experiment is designed to address such questions as: What controls the long-term storage of carbon in forest soils?  What chemical and physical parts of SOM are most stable?  Can added inputs increase soil carbon storage, or is maximum soil carbon storage more determined by climate and soil mineral makeup?  Monitoring changes in carbon storage in the DIRT plots will generate a time course of carbon stabilization and loss under the different treatments.  <br/><br/>Understanding the mechanisms that control soil carbon is vital not only to forest management, but also to the accurate prediction of feedbacks from forests to climate change.  The DIRT experiment is unique to environmental science and uniquely suited to explore the role of litter quality and quantity in determining stabilization of soil carbon, a significant unknown in current ecosystem models.  In this project, focus will also be placed on training of undergraduate Honors students, with results incorporated into a required Honors Ecology course at Oregon State University.

With help from experts in machine learning (artificial intelligence) and geographic information systems (GIS), they will work to build predictive models that can be used to understand the changing distributions of infectious diseases and identify future hotspots of novel disease emergence in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>Emerging infectious diseases, especially those that jump from wildlife to livestock and humans, threaten public health around the world. Using state of the art computational methods, the RCN will be able to answer critical questions such as: How and why do certain pathogens successfully move from one host species to another? Are hotspots of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife the same areas as hotspots of disease emergence in humans and livestock? To share its findings, the RCN will develop educational products such as webcasts and workshops aimed at educational levels from high school to post graduate, and will train students from under-represented groups through a summer research program. The RCN will also develop and maintain databases of global infectious disease biodiversity and make these data freely available to the academic community and the general public."

This is important because temperature and precipitation have strong effects on ecosystems. The main effects are on the flow of carbon, the supply of nutrients, the types of soil microbes, and the growth of plants. However, the exact rate and magnitude of change are unknown. This project will investigate a key knowledge gap by using experimental treatments that reduce precipitation and warm soil. This experiment has been sustained for almost two decades. This project will support the completion of the experiment in the next five years. The main question is whether the initial responses to shifts in temperature and precipitation are consistent over time, or whether the ecosystems adjust to the new conditions. In addition, this project will support scientific workforce training. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in methods of data collection and analysis. Outreach activities will be conducted with broad audiences through local non-profit groups. Finally, data will be provided online about primary production, plant community composition, and ecosystem carbon and nutrient balance, in open access format.<br/><br/>This project will extend a unique long-term experiment conducted across multiple ecosystem types, extending the timeline to over two decades. This experiment occurs along the C. Hart Merriam elevation gradient, extending from the forested slopes of the San Francisco Peaks to the woodlands and deserts of the Colorado Plateau, a region identified for its high sensitivity to climate. The project follows up on an earlier hypothesis that change in temperature and precipitation will elicit progressive reductions in primary production in semi-arid ecosystems that are sustained on decadal timescales. In other words, primary production may increasingly decline in response to the interactive effects of drought and heat. Here, two mechanisms will be tested that could drive this change: shifts in the plant community and changes in the nitrogen cycle. The prediction is that the combination of these two effects modulates long-term carbon and nutrient balance responses to experimental warming. Because these progressive effects operate on the timescales of community change and biogeochemistry (years to decades), measuring them requires continuing this long-term dataset. In this case, two decades will be sufficient time to see experimental responses of total ecosystem carbon and nitrogen balance. It is likely that that these responses will vary among the biomes represented along the elevational gradient, with the variation largely explained by the magnitude of the progressive effects. Testing these progressive effects across ecosystems ranging from desert grasslands to coniferous forests will fill critical knowledge gaps in ecosystem science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is believed that many sites will affect more than one trait, a phenomenon called pleiotropy.  The proportion of sites that are pleiotropic is not known, in part because how to find such sites is unclear.  This project investigates the patterns of pleiotropy in a model organism to see whether those effects are typically restricted to one simple part of the body, or are likely to have effects on many different parts.  If the team finds that a DNA change generally affects many traits, then this will suggest that those studying human genomes will have to look at diverse traits to understand how DNA changes affect specific aspects of heath. This project makes a fundamental contribution to our understanding of how genotypes map onto phenotypes. Additionally, the PIs will provide research opportunities for undergraduates in computational biology and will develop statistical software for the research community. <br/><br/>To characterize pleiotropy, the scientific team will use the fruit fly because of its rapid generation time and low cost. They will develop methods to automate the measurement of multiple body parts, and then characterize these parts in a set of 200 fully sequenced fly stocks.  They will develop statistical techniques to quantitatively characterize pleiotropy using these data.   The data and statistical techniques will then be used to find the DNA sites that affect the shape of the body, and to determine whether those effects typically are restricted to one part of the body, or affect many parts.  The statistical techniques to characterize pleiotropy developed in this project will apply directly to other species, including humans.

One such group of microbes is Aigarchaeota, a diverse, globally distributed group that inhabits terrestrial, geothermal hot springs and marine hydrothermal vents. The overall goal of this project is to dramatically expand our knowledge of the species diversity, distribution, ecological function, and organismal biology of Aigarchaeota and to establish a taxonomic classification for the entire group. More generally, this project aims to set a precedent for the investigation of poorly studied microbial biodiversity and integration of biodiversity research on microbes into a meaningful taxonomy.  This project will support a variety of researchers at Minority-Serving Institutions and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and will provide research opportunities for students who are underrepresented in science. In addition, this project will contribute to an educational outreach program that provides content knowledge to K-12 students and teachers throughout from Clark County School District, and provide high-school teachers the opportunity to participate in a workshop and field excursion to collect samples for microbial analysis.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on two major study sites, Great Boiling Spring in northwest Nevada, and springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, but also includes investigations of terrestrial and marine geothermal systems worldwide. The specific aims are: 1) To discover new Aigarchaeota taxa and erect a candidate taxonomic structure, 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from natural samples and mined from databases will be combined with single-cell genomic and metagenomic datasets; phylogenetics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics, and ecological niche modeling will be integrated to erect a candidate taxonomic structure; 2) To assess the function of Aigarchaeota, stable isotope labeling experiments, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, and metaproteomics will test explicit hypotheses about Aigarchaeota metabolism, providing a window into how Aigarchaeota organisms function in nature; and 3) To cultivate, isolate, and describe Aigarchaeota pure cultures, enrichment cultures will be established in the laboratory and used to try to isolate and describe axenic cultures by using both traditional and innovative approaches. The combination of large-scale data mining, phylogenetics, taxonomy, ecological niche modeling, and field and wet lab work described here spans all components of the Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster and aims to transform our knowledge of a major lineage of Archaea and provide insight into species- to domain-level evolution."

That is, while some species are common, others are rare. Scientists do not fully understand why such differences in the abundance of species exist and in particular how rare species can continue to persist.  As the natural world is dynamic, in order to persist, species must successfully respond to the environmental changes they experience. Possible ways to do this include adaptation and acclimation. Adaptation involves a genetic change in a population over generations. This ability to adapt is influenced by the variation found within a population and this variation may be limited for rare species, which often are found in small numbers. Acclimation involves the ability of an individual within its life-time to adjustment to different conditions. Acclimation may be especially important in the face of rapid environmental change because adaptation takes time. This study will examine how common and rare plant species adapt and acclimate to environmental change to understand how each can persist. The results of this study will help guide the conservation of rare species and will foster collaborations among researchers at botanical gardens and several undergraduate focused universities. This research will support student experiential learning, as well as the mentoring and inclusion of students from underrepresented groups in the natural sciences and community colleges. Finally, this project will also engage the public through science cafs and outreach opportunities at botanical gardens.<br/><br/>The question of why some species are rare while others are common is enduring and has important implications for ecological theory, the conservation of rare species, and the understanding of biodiversity patterns. This study will use a multi-faceted approach to address why some species are rare while others are common. First, to assess the potential acclimatory and adaptive constraints associated with the commonness of species, laboratory experiments using controlled-environments, as well as field surveys, will be conducted to compare the genetic diversity and ecophysiological plasticity found within and across a suite of rare endemic and common congeneric plant species. Second, to frame empirical investigations and understand the traits associated with plant rarity, a comprehensive synthesis of the existing primary literature will be conducted. And third, to predict the performance and persistence of rare species, empirically derived trait and plasticity based data will be used to develop mechanistic trait-based models. The collaborative research efforts supported by this study will provide a deeper conceptual understanding of species rarity and guidance for conservation efforts."

Scientists continue to discover increasing bacterial diversity as molecular methods improve. However, scientists do not understand how this genetic diversity relates to the evolution of new and ecologically important species. Better understanding of the processes that create bacterial diversity is needed, particularly in light of their useful functions in ecosystems. This research will study a group of bacteria, the cyanobacteria, that use light to sequester carbon and produce oxygen. New cyanobacterial species may form when barriers, such as distance or environmental conditions, isolate them and reduce the exchange of genes across populations. That exchange is called ""gene flow"". No one knows if it is distance, or the differences in environment, that prevent gene flow in these important organisms. This project will collect mats of cyanobacteria throughout the Eel River of Northwestern California, and the researchers will investigate the genetic similarity of those mats across different locations. Cyanobacteria will be sampled from distant locations with similar environments and adjacent locations with different environments. The data will be used to determine what is most important in creating cyanobacterial diversity. A local media organization will collaborate on the project. They will help a group of high school students to create a short science documentary film. Students will film the research done in the field and in the lab to gain knowledge about science communication. Their film and the project findings will be used by local schools.<br/><br/>This research will investigate genomic patterns and ecological processes that suggest how spatial and environmental barriers to gene flow differentiate cyanobacterial populations, generating nascent genetic diversity. These barriers are predicted to produce different patterns of nucleotide differentiation at neutral and adaptive loci. Therefore, more understanding of the processes driving biogeographical patterns of microbes can be achieved with analyses of closely related co-existing wild bacterial populations collected over variety of spatial scales. Benthic cyanobacterial mats (Phormidium spp.) and environmental variables will be sampled in the river network in a nested design spanning pairwise distances of centimeters to hundreds of kilometers across diverse habitats, from warm sunny downstream habitats to cool shaded tributaries. Using whole genome metagenomic analyses, patterns of nucleotide variation at loci throughout the genome will be compared and will be used to understand 1) the strength of sub-species population diversity in a widespread cyanobacterial genus, 2) the spatial scales of cyanobacterial population diversity, and 3) the contributions of spatial and environmental barriers to gene flow in driving the observed biogeographical patterns."

The ability of populations to adapt to stressful environmental conditions depends on the presence of genetic variation in survival and reproduction, as well as a genetic variation in the traits that affect survival and reproduction, such as plant physiology and timing of reproduction.  Very few studies have measured the process of adaptation to identify the factors that determine how rapidly plant populations adapt to water-limited conditions, in nature. This research will integrate measures of: (1) genetic variation in plant survival and reproduction, both within and among natural populations, as well as in the traits that contribute to plant performance; (2) natural selection in wild populations; and (3) changes between generations in the genetically based aspects of survival and reproduction.  Statistical models based on evolutionary theory will be used to predict the magnitude of adaptive change that should occur in each study population.  These predictions will be compared to the actual change in survivoral and reproduction observed between generations. Undergraduate students in under-represented groups will be recruited to participate in this research through the Ecological Society of America, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, and the Society for the Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science. These students will be trained in the design, implementation, and analysis of genetic data collected from field and breeding experiments. Cooperative relationships will be built with the Environmental and Lands departments of Tribal communities, and workshops will be offered to local communities to inform them of the goals, methods, and outcomes of this research.<br/><br/>Many studies of plant species have detected plastic responses of phenological or morphological traits to experimentally induced or natural environmental variation, or changes in the strength or direction of phenotypic selection in populations occupying different environments.  To date, however, no studies have assessed evolutionary change between generations, in real time, across natural environmental gradients with respect to phenological, morphological, and physiological traits. This study will combine detailed studies of geographic variation in fitness-related traits among populations of a widespread herb (Nemophila menziesii, Hydrophyllaceae) with measures of: phenotypic selection on traits that contribute to drought-tolerance; inter-generational change in additive genetic variance in fitness; and the response to selection in order to test predictions regarding adaptation to environmental conditions across an aridity gradient. Aster models will be used to estimate additive genetic variance in individual fitness in pedigreed populations under field conditions and to estimate the strength and direction of selection on phenological, morphological, and physiological traits. These models will facilitate the empirical evaluation of the accuracy of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection (FFT), which predicts that the rate of change in population mean fitness should equal the ratio of additive genetic variance in fitness to mean absolute fitness. This ratio represents a population's capacity to adapt to current conditions, or its ""adaptive capacity"".  This project will be the first rigorous evaluation of FFT in wild populations across an environmental gradient. This study will contribute to the understanding of how natural selection operates across a species' range, potentially identifying mechanisms, such as the existence of multiple combinations of traits associated with fitness optima, that promote the maintenance of genetic variation in wild populations."

Ants are highly diverse in many different habitats and are important for ecological processes worldwide. To understand what promotes the persistence of ant diversity, the association between physical traits, such as spines and stings, and ecological interactions, like competition and defenses against predators, must be experimentally determined. This project will investigate one of the most widespread and commonly encountered ant groups in tropical Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, the spiny ant, Polyrhachis. Using ecological field experiments, this research will assess the effect of a wide range of anatomical defenses on ant competition and anti-predator defense. It will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that promote biodiversity in tropical habitats. Furthermore, this project will foster international collaborations between researchers in the U.S. and those in China. The researchers will also actively participate in numerous outreach and public engagement opportunities in Chicago, including various science education programs at the Field Museum of Natural History, and academic tutoring of middle and high school students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>To elucidate the ecological selective forces driving spine adaptation and specialization in Polyrhachis, the researchers will conduct a series of competition and predator-prey experiments at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (XTBG) in Yunnan, China. These experiments will include a range of species that are present at this site and that span the full range of spine morphology, from absent to extremely long. In the first set of tests, the researchers will assess the impact of spines on interspecific ant competition. In the second, the researchers will quantify the survival benefit conferred by spines as defenses against frog predators. These experiments will be conducted in the lab using colonies collected in the field. A common chamber design with experimental spine length manipulation will allow for differentiating the survival effects of spine length in terms of two fundamental ecological interactions. Using data from these experiments, the researchers will evaluate the evidence for an ecological trade-off between competitive ability and anti-predator defense mediated by spines. These empirical tests of the trade-off hypothesis in Polyrhachis, a remarkable animal radiation, will expand scientific understanding of the processes that promote community coexistence and ecological success."

But numerous observations indicate that this understanding fails when ecosystems are changing rapidly.  The project will build upon ideas that have proven successful in statistical physics and the relatively new field of information theory.  The expected output is a quantitative, predictive and thus testable, theory of ecosystem structure that will be applicable to both undisturbed ecosystems and to those that are changing rapidly in response to disturbance.   Because our livelihoods are entangled with the health of our ecosystems in numerous ways, both insofar as our activities can alter nature and nature can enrich our lives, this research will contribute to the betterment of humankind as well as the advancement of basic science. This project will support a postdoctoral research fellow and provide research training experiences for graduate students.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to advance and test a dynamic theory that can predict patterns in the abundance, distribution, and energetics of individuals and species in ecosystems.  The theory should apply to ecosystems that are either static or changing rapidly in response to disturbance.  To achieve that goal, insights from statistical physics and information theory will be combined with explicit mechanisms governing organismal and population growth, as well as migration, diversification, and extinction.  Stochastic mechanistic theory will predict the time-dependent probability distributions of a small set of governing state variables that play a role similar to that of pressure, volume, and temperature in thermodynamics.  These state variables will then provide the constraints used in maximizing information entropy to yield predicted probability distributions for the detailed patterns displayed by individuals and species. The expected outcome is a general theory of both static and dynamic ecology.  Ecological census data from the tropics to the tundra, from plants to animals, across a wide range of spatial scales, and under a variety of disturbances, will be used to test the predictions of the new theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These arthropods often contain within them numerous bacteria that are also called microbes. We know very little about the role of these microbes in disease transmitting arthropods or if and how they interact with one another. Using the western black-legged tick, this study examines how the internal collection of microbes develops within the tick and whether the types or numbers of these microbes negatively or positively influence the ability of these arthropods to transmit disease causing bacteria to new hosts. To understand how a collection of microbes develops, ticks will be allowed to feed on different hosts, such as lizards or mice. Then researchers will examine how the different microbe collections within these ticks influence their ability to transmit the bacteria that causes Lyme disease from one host to another. An improved understanding of the role microbes play in the transmission of diseases will allow for the development of new perspectives and strategies for managing disease risk and conserving wildlife. This project also will train undergraduate and graduate students and will develop citizen science opportunities. The citizen science opportunities will include development of a mobile phone app to allow the public to provide scientists with tick distribution and encounter data while increasing the public's awareness of tick transmitted illnesses. This study has clear public health implications as Lyme disease is the most reported vector-borne disease in the United States. <br/><br/>An emerging question in the field of disease ecology is whether the microbial community of potential vectors can facilitate or inhibit the transmission of pathogens.  This study will focus on the tick, Ixodes pacificus, which is the main vector of Lyme disease in the western United States, and will use a combination of lab and field experiments to examine how feeding on different host species affects the development of the tick microbiome and influences gut development and microbe transmission efficiency. To determine the role of host blood meal on the tick's microbiome and midgut structure, next generation 16S rRNA sequencing of the bacterial microbiome and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques will be used. To determine the effect of host blood meal history on the acquisition and transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, quantitative PCR, microbiome analyses, and visualization techniques will be used. By experimentally manipulating and evaluating the factors that structure tick microbiomes and by understanding the mechanistic role that microbes play in pathogen transmission, this study will advance our understanding of how microbe-vector-associated communities are shaped and how these relationships influence disease ecology more broadly."

This project will study the consequences of changes in the relative timing of interactions between monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), their host plants (Asclepias spp., or milkweeds), and the associated community of other plants and arthropod. Field experiments, observational studies, historic datasets, and computer simulation models will be used to test: 1) how shifts in the relative timing of milkweed-monarch interactions affect the growth and survival of monarch caterpillars, 2) how the timing of milkweed-monarch interactions has changed over the past four decades, and 3) how the evolutionary history of a community affects the incidence and impacts of shifts in the timing of interactions. This study will create new knowledge about how ecological communities respond to shifts in the timing of species interactions in order to better understand the vulnerability and resilience of complex natural systems.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this work will include a combined research and education project, the Monitoring Milkweed-Monarch Interactions for Learning and Conservation (MMMILC) Project. Under the guidance of faculty and graduate students, undergraduate students in the MMMILC Project will mentor local high school students while they collect long-term observational data on milkweed-monarch interactions.

There is an emerging view, however, that within-plant C-sink processes (growth, storage, and respiration) are directly regulated by the environment and by within-plant feedbacks (the 'C-sink regulation' hypothesis), such that changes in allocation and sink processes are a key mechanism of drought response. Realistically propagating such mechanisms to the ecosystem scale requires accounting for species-specific strategies that vary across the plant economic spectrum. To realistically test this hypothesis, the following challenges will be me through integrating measurements of tree C-source (photosynthesis) and C-sink (growth, storage, respiration) processes across a range of hydraulic traits to identify regulating mechanisms; Upscaling the mechanisms of drought response to the ecosystem level by focusing on distributions of both resources and plant hydraulic traits mapped to the plant economic spectrum; and  Observing the ecosystem-scale photosynthetic C source (Gross Ecosystem Productivity, GEP) and water loss by transpiration.

In particular, when species hybridize in nature it obscures the patterns of morphological and genetic variation that scientists usually use to recognize them. In some cases, hybridization is also associated with unique and interesting biological phenomena, such as changes in reproductive modes, chromosome number, or evolutionary adaptation. In this project, the research team will develop ways to accurately recognize species in a group of lizards where hybridization is common and species identification has been challenging: The North and Central American Whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. In addition to improving methods for recognizing species, this research will increase the understanding of the effects of hybridization in the wild, as well as the evolution of reproductive modes in this group of lizards. The research activities will also provide training for a diverse team of scientists and students, many from groups typically underrepresented in science, in Hawaii and California.<br/><br/>Whiptails have diversified rapidly and experienced a large amount of introgressive hybridization, which makes them ideal for evaluating phylogenetic and population genetic methods for disentangling hybridization, lineage sorting, and systematic error. Hybridization between gonochoristic species has also repeatedly led to the formation of parthenogenetic lineages at a frequency that is essentially unique to this group. The research team will use genomic and morphological data to disentangle the effects of introgressive hybridization and lineage sorting on the patterns of divergence between all lineages of the Whiptail lizards, and use these results to infer the origins of parthenogenesis across the genus. By examining the geographic, temporal, and genomic dynamics of hybridization and introgression in Whiptails, the project will provide a better understanding of how gene flow impacts the speciation process in nature, and across evolutionary time. Comprehensively resolving patterns of speciation among Whiptails will also shed light on the processes associated with the frequent changes in reproductive mode that make them unique among vertebrates, and contribute to their ability to serve as a model system for other areas of inquiry across the life and biomedical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research in southern New England has found a connection between phenology - the timing of biological events - and species loss in plant communities. Plants with flexible flowering phenology (i.e. blooming earlier in warmer years, and later in cooler years) are less likely to decline in abundance or disappear from the landscape. In Acadia, the researchers used historical data from the late 19th century to record patterns in species loss over the past 120 years. This project will monitor leaf out and flowering phenology in Acadia to record how plants are responding to changing temperatures and explore connections between phenology and species loss. The researchers will work with undergraduates from Maine colleges and universities to monitor leaf out and flowering phenology for thirty plant species on three observational transects that traverse three peaks within the National Park, as well as three experimental transplant gardens along an elevational gradient along one peak. In addition, the researchers will develop a citizen science opportunity for hikers to participate in this research on the three peaks. <br/><br/>There is a demonstrated connection between advancing spring plant phenology and warming temperatures in temperate northeast North America. However, plants display differential phenological responses to warming depending on taxa, population, habitat, elevation, and/or geographic location. Phenology is a key plant trait included in many climate vulnerability assessment methods, but its use in these assessments has not been rigorously evaluated, in part because researchers need a better understanding of the environmental controls on phenology at a species level. Here this is achieved through an interdisciplinary approach merging historical ecology, observational and experimental fieldwork, and citizen science in Acadia National Park. In this project, observational monitoring on transects will quantify the relationship between spring temperatures and shifts in phenology at the species level for a community of thirty common plant species in Acadia. Researchers will use these results to facilitate a regional comparison of phenology and species loss for conspecific populations in Acadia versus Concord, Massachusetts. Three reciprocal transplant gardens at three elevations on one peak will test the relative effects of environmental cues and genetic differences at the population level on spring phenology for three understory plant species in Acadia. This project will further our understanding of the ecological effects of climate change, educate visitors about climate change research, and inform resource management in Acadia National Park."

It is assumed that when a species evolves to become diurnal or nocturnal, its eyes, olfactory organs, and the genes associated with these structures also evolve. However, this concept remains largely untested, because a comprehensive evolutionary tree and associated comparative data are not available. Silkmoths and relatives are some of the most conspicuous moths, and they provide an excellent opportunity to study how two potentially complementary sensory systems -- sight and smell -- have evolved. The group includes many model organisms, such as the domesticated silkmoth and tobacco hornworm, which play key roles in many areas of the biological sciences. Some silkmoths and relatives are damaging to agriculture, and they are frequently used as an educational tool because of their large size, charisma, and ability to captivate children in classrooms. Despite their role in science and education, this model group still lacks a robust estimate of evolutionary relationships. With collaborative research teams in the United States and the United Kingdom, this project will assemble an extensive genetic dataset and reconstruct a robust evolutionary tree for the group. Two postdoctoral researchers, two graduates students, several undergraduates, and dozens of elementary, middle and high school students will be trained, including many students from under-represented groups. <br/><br/>This study will produce a comprehensive phylogeny of a model insect group, the silkmoths and relatives (Lepidoptera: Bombycoidea) and use it to study the evolution of two principal sensory systems: vision and olfaction. The project will develop a US-UK collaborative partnership across five institutions to initially generate a target capture-based backbone phylogeny based on 700 genetic loci and 1000 species of Bombycoidea.  Scanning electron microscopy and 3D Micro-computed Tomography scanning will then be used to quantify sensory morphology of two key organs (eye and antenna) that are central to insect vision and olfaction.  The molecular evolution of vision and olfactory gene sequences isolated from sensory organ transcriptomes will be analyzed to test for evidence of selection between related diurnal and nocturnal species. Gene sequences will be isolated from frozen and museum specimens using new methodologies, thereby making this tool useful to the broader community of scientists."

One such group of microbes is Aigarchaeota, a diverse, globally distributed group that inhabits terrestrial, geothermal hot springs and marine hydrothermal vents. The overall goal of this project is to dramatically expand our knowledge of the species diversity, distribution, ecological function, and organismal biology of Aigarchaeota and to establish a taxonomic classification for the entire group. More generally, this project aims to set a precedent for the investigation of poorly studied microbial biodiversity and integration of biodiversity research on microbes into a meaningful taxonomy.  This project will support a variety of researchers at Minority-Serving Institutions and Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and will provide research opportunities for students who are underrepresented in science. In addition, this project will contribute to an educational outreach program that provides content knowledge to K-12 students and teachers throughout from Clark County School District, and provide high-school teachers the opportunity to participate in a workshop and field excursion to collect samples for microbial analysis.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on two major study sites, Great Boiling Spring in northwest Nevada, and springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, China, but also includes investigations of terrestrial and marine geothermal systems worldwide. The specific aims are: 1) To discover new Aigarchaeota taxa and erect a candidate taxonomic structure, 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from natural samples and mined from databases will be combined with single-cell genomic and metagenomic datasets; phylogenetics, phylogenomics, comparative genomics, and ecological niche modeling will be integrated to erect a candidate taxonomic structure; 2) To assess the function of Aigarchaeota, stable isotope labeling experiments, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, and metaproteomics will test explicit hypotheses about Aigarchaeota metabolism, providing a window into how Aigarchaeota organisms function in nature; and 3) To cultivate, isolate, and describe Aigarchaeota pure cultures, enrichment cultures will be established in the laboratory and used to try to isolate and describe axenic cultures by using both traditional and innovative approaches. The combination of large-scale data mining, phylogenetics, taxonomy, ecological niche modeling, and field and wet lab work described here spans all components of the Systematics and Biodiversity Sciences Cluster and aims to transform our knowledge of a major lineage of Archaea and provide insight into species- to domain-level evolution."

Scientists must be able to accurately recognize the boundaries between species, and the relationships among them, to understand fundamental biological processes and global patterns of biological diversity. The biology of some organisms makes recognizing species challenging. In particular, when species hybridize in nature it obscures the patterns of morphological and genetic variation that scientists usually use to recognize them. In some cases, hybridization is also associated with unique and interesting biological phenomena, such as changes in reproductive modes, chromosome number, or evolutionary adaptation. In this project, the research team will develop ways to accurately recognize species in a group of lizards where hybridization is common and species identification has been challenging: The North and Central American Whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. In addition to improving methods for recognizing species, this research will increase the understanding of the effects of hybridization in the wild, as well as the evolution of reproductive modes in this group of lizards. The research activities will also provide training for a diverse team of scientists and students, many from groups typically underrepresented in science, in Hawaii and California.<br/><br/>Whiptails have diversified rapidly and experienced a large amount of introgressive hybridization, which makes them ideal for evaluating phylogenetic and population genetic methods for disentangling hybridization, lineage sorting, and systematic error. Hybridization between gonochoristic species has also repeatedly led to the formation of parthenogenetic lineages at a frequency that is essentially unique to this group. The research team will use genomic and morphological data to disentangle the effects of introgressive hybridization and lineage sorting on the patterns of divergence between all lineages of the Whiptail lizards, and use these results to infer the origins of parthenogenesis across the genus. By examining the geographic, temporal, and genomic dynamics of hybridization and introgression in Whiptails, the project will provide a better understanding of how gene flow impacts the speciation process in nature, and across evolutionary time. Comprehensively resolving patterns of speciation among Whiptails will also shed light on the processes associated with the frequent changes in reproductive mode that make them unique among vertebrates, and contribute to their ability to serve as a model system for other areas of inquiry across the life and biomedical sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adaptive radiation occurs when a group rapidly diversifies into many species to fill a variety of ecological roles. While adaptive radiation is a common theme in the evolution of life, many of its features are poorly understood. This project seeks to better understand how adaptive radiation proceeds. The project will examine the rate of diversification in genes, morphology and species diversity over the evolutionary history of a group of rodents containing more than 600 species. The study will determine how changes in genes, morphology and species are correlated as the species diversified. Importantly, the group under study contains the common lab mouse and rat, two species that serve as scientific models in medical and basic research. This study will place these model organisms in an evolutionary context that will allow scientists to better understand how their genes and other characteristics have evolved. Such understanding provides new insight into genes and characteristics of medical significance. Scientific meetings organized by the researchers will bring together scientists who study mice and rats from different perspectives, including molecular biology and medicine, to share insight and generate new research questions. In addition to the broader impacts on basic science and medicine, public outreach and education events at participating natural history museums will use the results of this research to teach principles of evolutionary biology to K-12 students and improve public understanding of science.<br/><br/>This project integrates comparative genomics with quantitative morphology in a rigorous phylogenetic framework to illuminate the dynamics of diversification in lineages, phenotypes, and genes across the most species-rich adaptive radiation in mammals. The exceptional species and ecomorphological diversity in rats and mice (subfamily Murinae, 634 living species) arose over the last 14 million years through replicate adaptive radiations, primarily in the distinct biogeographic units of Indo-Australia. This research will expand on the genomic resources from the leading mammalian model organisms to encompass the diversity of murine rodents by sequencing whole exomes from a large, phylogenetically dispersed set of species. In addition, the project will generate high-resolution, 3D morphometric models of cranial and post-cranial skeletons from the same species. The project will combine these distinct data layers to: estimate a species-level phylogeny of the Murinae; identify and date biogeographic and ecological transitions; estimate diversification rate shifts across the phylogeny; estimate rates of phenotypic and molecular evolution relative to transitions (biogeographic and ecological) and shifts in lineage diversification rate; test for correlations between the tempos of phenotypic and molecular evolution; and, quantify morphological and molecular convergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because biodiversity is essential to the health of the planet, it is important to understand how it is generated, maintained and lost. This topic, however, is extraordinarily complex. Biodiversity distribution patterns and ecosystem services are regulated by processes that operate across multiple hierarchical levels of organization, temporal dimensions, and spatial scales. This Research Coordination Network brings together a diverse set of researchers to integrate data and explore novel concepts that will rapidly advance the field. Researchers will explicitly investigate processes that span hierarchical levels to identify novel properties that could not have been predicted by investigating the individual parts alone. Biologists working at different scales of organization will lead the effort, in coordination with researchers with expertise in machine learning, modeling, and mathematics to ensure the required cyberinfrastructure will advance in sync with new biodiversity and ecological forecasting theory. Annual meetings and workshops will offer diverse training opportunities in biodiversity informatics and scientific communication to students and faculty. The network will establish student research immersion opportunities and extensive cross-disciplinary training through exchanges among biodiversity, environmental biology, and computer sciences laboratories at the collaborating institutions. Based on participant feedback, the Research Coordination Network will adapt best student-centric practices of collaborative research, and report them to the scientific community. Envisioned products include perspective, synthetic, proof-of-concept, and data-driven publications, and presentations at scientific meetings, webinars, and learning modules. The project also will provide outstanding education and networking opportunities to scientists at different career levels, institutions, and cultural backgrounds, contributing to the establishment of a diverse and well-trained workforce in the U.S.<br/><br/>The non-linearity of the complex mechanisms regulating biodiversity and ecological processes makes predictions difficult, and requires diverse data and novel analytical methods to make forecasting more accurate. This Research Coordination Network promotes convergence by bringing together a diverse set of biologists, environmental biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians to explore the cross-scale processes regulating the Rules of Life, and the theory, models, and cyberinfrastructure needed to analyze them. This Research Coordination Network will focus on four major topics: 1) how to incorporate cross-scale processes into models of biodiversity patterns and predictions about the ecosystem functions they provide; 2) exploration and expansion of novel biodiversity monitoring approaches to better understand patterns and processes acting across scales (particularly through the use of proximal and remote sensing methods); 3) challenges and possible solutions in bioinformatics and cyberinfrastructure to foster new ways to handle storage, integration, and visualization of complex biological and environmental data; and 4) novel approaches to enhance public awareness about the complexity, value, and role of biodiversity. This convergence approach promises to provide novel insights into fundamental questions about biodiversity and ecological forecasting that will have a broad impact on the biological sciences, and society more generally."

Many of the steps in the breakdown of this organic matter are greatly affected by water temperature, which is increasing along with air temperature globally. While the effects of temperature on some of these steps are understood relatively well at small scales, it remains an open question how they interact as a complex, integrated ecosystem-level process to drive the effects of rising temperatures at the large spatial and temporal scales over which Earth's river systems operate. Consequently, research is needed that tests the effects of temperature on organic matter breakdown in whole ecosystems, with the explicit goal of scaling up these results to understand how entire river reaches and networks process organic matter. This project will use data from temperature manipulations at multiple spatial and temporal scales to: 1) inform ecological theory that uses basic principles to understand how the effects of temperature scale from individual organisms to entire ecosystems; and 2) build a model that simulates the effects of temperature on organic matter processing in an entire forest stream network. This research is important because rising temperatures may alter the global biogeochemical role of streams and rivers in currently unpredictable ways, making the results useful in the future management of river health. An education program will be an integral part of this project and will include the development of a citizen science project, as well as training of undergraduates, graduate students and research technicians.<br/> Fieldwork for this project will take place at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, U.S.A., a site with a decades-long history of research on organic matter processing in stream ecosystems. The first objective is to understand how warming affects the organisms (fungi and invertebrates) that are critically important in organic matter breakdown in streams. This component of the project will combine detailed laboratory-based studies of fungi, experiments in heated streamside channels and the warming of an entire reach of a small forest stream to understand how higher temperatures change community structure of fungal and animal decomposers. The second objective is to use the various temperature manipulations to understand how temperature changes pathways and rates of organic matter processing in streams and rivers. The fates of organic matter will be studied using laboratory investigations, streamside channels, and field experiments combined with organic matter budgets and food web descriptions in the experimentally warmed stream and a matching reference stream. The results of these first two objectives will be combined with extensive existing datasets available at the Coweeta site to inform the final objective: construction of an ecological model that predicts the effects of warming on organic matter processing in an entire stream network. This model will also allow incorporation of other important factors that could potentially change in the future, such as precipitation and the relative quality of organic matter that enters stream ecosystems. Together, this research will provide much needed information about how warming influences the important biogeochemical role of streams and rivers."

They support local economies comprised of ranchers, farmers, and pastoralists around the world. Transitions from grass- to shrub-dominated communities are increasing in frequency, threatening human well-being and these economies in both developed and developing countries. This long-term project explores the diverse mechanisms responsible for these changes in an effort to predict the future of arid-land habitats. Clear understanding of underlying mechanisms is necessary to maintain arable land and ecosystem services necessary for human well being. The project engages hundreds of middle and high school students and teachers who sample along the Middle Rio Grande, a highly visible and highly disturbed ecosystem. The resulting data are used by local conservancy groups, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, to name a few among many agencies, in management of an economically and culturally important region. Participants in the Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program blend Hispanic, Native American, and Anglo cultures and integrate participants from inner-city, suburban, and rural areas. By connecting K-12 and university students in scientific research, the project enhances education in STEM fields. Undergraduate training is also extensive, involving national efforts to recruit under-served groups into science and participation from the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute. <br/><br/>Research at the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological Research site seeks to understand how abiotic drivers and constraints affect the pulse dynamics and stability of arid-land populations, communities, and ecosystems. This award will extend previous research on short-term, local-scale processes to understand pulse-driven regional-scale transitions and transfer of materials between landscape units. An experiment at the grassland-shrubland transition will be initiated to understand the roles of shallow versus deep soil moisture in plant and microbial exchanges and associated ecosystem processes. A rain manipulation will impose large monsoons to assess the impact of rainfall pulses, and manipulations of fragile bio-crusts will document exchanges and biotic interactions underlying a novel loop by which fungi integrate ecosystem functions by transforming, translocating, and storing C and nutrients.  New research in pinon-juniper woodlands will examine plant function across this transition and assess microbial community responses to water manipulations. This research will compare the role that fungi play in woodlands with the roles that microbes play in grasslands. High resolution measurements of daily and seasonal changes in water quality and quantity will be used to document how disturbances such as fire interact with pulses of rain to transfer nutrients and organic matter into tributaries that feed the Rio Grande River. Results from these diverse activities will be integrated, using simulation models, to document the effects that precipitation pulses have on plant  recruitment, growth, and mortality of different species at the plant to patch scale, and how these drive long-term patterns in dominance and composition across landscapes."

The infected plant or animal is called a ""host"" and the infecting organism is called a ""pathogen"".  The interaction between hosts and pathogens is important to understand because it often determines one's health. Scientists are now becoming aware that the host-pathogen interaction is more complicated because one host can be infected by many pathogens, all of whom interact with each other as well as with the host.  Likewise, one type of pathogen can infect several types of hosts, and how one host responds can influence whether another host becomes infected.  Figuring out how all this plays out in Nature requires carefully designed experiments and mathematical models and this project provides both.  Developing a deeper understanding of hosts and pathogens is critical because humans are dramatically altering the biological world, introducing new types of hosts and pathogens in some areas and removing them from others. Understanding how such gains and losses of organisms influences the spread of disease is important to the fields of conservation science and public health. This research program will train undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in the fields of disease ecology and mathematical biology, and will engage the public through a variety of outreach activities. <br/><br/>Humans are impacting biodiversity patterns globally and these changes can influence the risk and prevalence of infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic multi-host multi-pathogen epidemiological theory that explains how between-host and between-pathogen competition jointly shape disease dynamics.  To determine how competition alters the amplification or dilution of diseases, mathematical models will be developed and tested using planktonic species and their associated pathogens via laboratory based mesocosm and field experiments. This work will both extend current theory on multi-host and multi-pathogen communities as well as unify theory developed independently for diseases with different transmission modes.  The theory-data pairing approach of this study is likely to generate important advances in epidemiological theory and disease ecology. This work will also yield insight into how future alterations to diversity will affect disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study uses a 20-year old, field experiment, called BioCON, that raises the carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere above prairie plant communities to levels that are expected to occur later in this century. The experiment is designed to study how higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere affects the growth of different kinds of plants. The experiment is also designed to understand how the availability of soil nitrogen, an important nutrient that plants need to grow, influences the ability of plants to take up higher levels of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Data from the study will be made publicly available through the Cedar Creek, Long Term Ecological Research website. BioCON is visited by over 2500 K-12 students and teachers annually, including teachers of Native American students. College students work and learn how to carry out their own research projects in BioCON each summer. New K-12 lesson plans as well as videos for the sustainability science themed YouTube Channel MinuteEarth will be developed that specifically feature new knowledge gained from BioCON. <br/><br/>Through continued measurements of functional group and functional group mixture responses to carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen treatments, this study will test two kinds of hypotheses. The first set uses a functional trait classification framework to develop predictions regarding direct functional group responses to eCO2 and N (i.e., responses expected in the absence of soil-mediated feedbacks, species interactions, or interactions with stochastic or directional changes in climate). The second set posits that long-term outcomes will diverge from predictions based on expected direct responses because of modifying processes, involving physiological acclimation, functional group effects on aboveground and belowground resource supply and soil pH, and interactions between treatments and variation in climate. The long-lived perennials in BioCON have not yet equilibrated in their response to CO2 and N, exhibiting interactions with year-to-year variation in climate and generating soil-mediated feedbacks. In BioCON, across 20 years, C4 species have become increasingly productive under high CO2 whereas the benefit of CO2 has gradually disappeared for C3 species, contradicting current theory. Understanding these divergent responses and whether they will continue is a major focus of the study, along with understanding the role of functional groups with respect to other long-term processes relevant to ecosystems under global environmental change, including productivity, decomposition, nutrient cycling, and water fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The links between terrestrial and marine ecosystems are especially tight in the coastal temperate rainforests of Alaska and British Columbia. Abundant rainfall moves nutrients held in glaciers, dense forests, and wetlands to estuaries and fjords, supporting productive fisheries and robust marine mammal populations. This region includes the largest remaining old-growth forests in North America; has among the highest rates of glacier melt on the planet; supports billion-dollar fishing and tourism industries; and is home to tens of thousands of people who depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Because the movement of fresh water and nutrients plays a key role in these linked ecosystems, climate-driven changes in this flow may impact coastal ecosystems and the human communities that depend on them. The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network is an international research collaborative that will facilitate a better understanding of these processes and impacts. This Network will establish a core community of scientists and stakeholders to function as an information and guidance resource for ecosystem management and community adaptation into the future. An improved understanding of this ecosystem will help build resilience in local communities and ecosystems in a warming and increasingly variable climate. Additionally, it will provide a foundation for understanding climate-driven changes within coastal temperate rainforests and coastal margins worldwide.<br/><br/>The Coastal Rainforest Margins Research Network will be composed of research communities organized within key disciplines, including hydrology, forest ecology, soil science, biogeochemistry, and near-shore marine ecology. These disciplinary communities will address critical information gaps, develop regional collaborations, and synthesize knowledge regarding water, carbon, and nutrient fluxes in a landscape where intense transformations and rapid transfers between terrestrial and freshwater environments control the delivery of these materials to the coastal ocean. The Network will achieve these goals through three main activities: 1) structured information exchanges among Network participants, including regular teleconferences, research webinars, field site visits, web-hosted meetings, and annual multi-day workshops that bring the entire Network together; 2) creation of working groups to develop data collection, management and sharing protocols; and 3) development of outreach products useful to Network members as well as policy-makers and resource managers."

Convergent evolution occurs when the same trait evolves independently two or more times, providing natural replicates of adaptive evolution.  For example, feeding on nectar and its accompanying morphological adaptations (e.g., long tapered bills with specialized tongue structures) have evolved independently in hummingbirds in North and South America, and in the sunbirds, spiderhunters, and flowerpeckers of Africa, Asia, and Australasia.  This project will study these two groups of birds to better understand the ecological and genetic factors that lead to convergent evolution in associated genes and physiology.  The research will investigate convergent evolution in the ability to taste sugar, metabolize alcohol, and live at high altitudes where there is less oxygen.  It will also study convergence in the microbial communities living in the guts of the birds.  This study will reveal how often the same genetic changes are responsible for the evolution of functionally similar physiological traits, and will lead to an improved understanding of adaptation and species diversification.  The research will result in comprehensive evolutionary trees for hummingbirds, sunbirds, spiderhunters, and flowerpeckers, which will be an important resource for the conservation of these diverse avian groups that together constitute ~5% of bird species diversity.  This project will train three graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow in research techniques integrating bioinformatics, functional physiology, behavioral ecology, genetics, and phylogenetics. It will also train up to ten undergraduates in sophisticated molecular genetic techniques and physiological research, which will give them valuable research experience. This grant will promote public understanding of science through a collaboration with educators who run the ""Understanding Evolution"" website, who will help to develop course materials for teachers that explain evolutionary concepts like adaptation and convergent evolution in the context of the diversification of hummingbirds and sunbirds.<br/><br/>This project will study convergence in traits that improve hypoxia resistance, convergence in traits related to nectarivory, and will investigate how traits related to nectarivory may converge in high-altitude environments that characterize the diversification of hummingbirds and sunbirds.  On the genetic level, the research team will study genes related to nectarivory (i.e., sugar taste receptors, alcohol metabolism genes) and gene pathways that can confer hypoxia resistance (i.e., hemoglobin, OXPHOS, and hypoxia-inducible factor pathways). In addition, the researchers will sequence 16S ribosomal RNA genes from gut samples of nectarivorous birds to study microbial communities. On the functional level, the research team will test how genetic changes have altered phenotypes important for both organismal function and subsequent diversification into new ecological niches. To accomplish this, the team will perform physiological tests to measure hypoxia resistance, quantify dietary alcohol exposure (in the form of fermented nectar) from feather samples, predict metabolic functions of gut microbes from their 16S rRNA sequences, assay functional differences among genetic variants in the lab (e.g., cell-culture assays that measure responsiveness of different taste receptor variants), and conduct behavioral tests of taste discrimination abilities. On the phylogenetic level, the research team will study the evolutionary history of genes and phenotypes to reveal instances of convergent evolution within and between the two avian radiations. Finally, the team will integrate all genetic, functional, and phylogenetic data to evaluate: (1) how the prevalence of convergent genetic evolution changes with time, and (2) how suites of traits co-evolve in response to high-altitude environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This similarity of ecological characteristics is driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple scales?e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region?that will shape the structure and function of the ARM over 50 to 100 year time frames, with potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality. This research addresses two core questions. First, what factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM? While this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. Researchers will test the hypothesis that that although dispersal from natural and interstitial areas, climate change, and changes in homeowner knowledge will promote ecological change; institutions, norms and values will function as counteracting, stabilizing forces on these ecological dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results will be used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM. Second, what are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?  The hypothesis to be tested is that management that promotes nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale. Five types of residential parcels that vary in management goals and intensity and embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied in six U.S. cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles), to quantify influences on ecological dynamics.

This process is the fundamental source of biodiversity and yet is still not well understood. This project will help us understand the genetic, behavioral, and morphological changes that allowed new species to fully differentiate from one another. The research focuses on fruit flies, which have long served as a model organism for studies of genetics. The researchers will study three species of fruit flies that diverged from a common ancestor species only in the last 5,000-16,000 years.  By studying closely related species, it is possible to tease apart which genetic changes led to the original separation versus which changes happened afterwards. In particular, the project will identify what genetic differences are associated with differences in mating behavior and morphology that restrict or even prevent interbreeding between newly diverged species. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at two liberal arts colleges and train them in DNA sequencing and genetic analysis.  Further, the research findings will be used to train high school teachers and develop science educational workshops in upstate New York and western Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The researchers will test the hypothesis that chromosomal inversions have caused divergence and speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex by testing two key predictions: 1) Chromosomal inversions contain Quantitative Trait Loci for divergent male courtship song and female mating preferences that are responsible for sexual isolation between these taxa. 2) Chromosomal inversions show greater sequence divergence compared to genomic regions outside of the inversions. This study will directly test if chromosomal inversions harbor phenotypes that cause sexual isolation and thereby instigated reduction in gene flow between nascent species, thus facilitating the process of genomic divergence and speciation. Two datasets will be collected: inter-species crosses to genetically map behavioral speciation phenotypes and population genomic data covering the entire geographical range of each behavioral species."

Yet such forecasts are crucial for managing and halting epidemic spread. This project uses computational tools from mathematics, computer science, epidemiology and ecology to understand and predict the spread of a devastating disease of cave-dwelling bats, white-nose syndrome, which is caused by the soil fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. This project addresses two specific problems. First, it seeks to identify the corridors along which white-nose syndrome is likely to spread and the locations most at risk, using the spatial pattern of past spread and an approach called network analysis. New methods will be used that will speed up computations, turning the computer model into a more useful tool in management and control. Second, the local, random processes that affect individual caves will be linked to the process of spread at regional to continental scales. This multi-scale linkage will be the first to use a simulation modeling method, called the equation-free approach, to estimating epidemics when data are limited, which is most of the time in such circumstances. The combining of these two approaches will provide a more accurate understanding how white-nose syndrome has spread already and how it is likely to spread in the future.<br/><br/>The economic benefit that bats provide to agriculture in the United States by eating insects has been estimated to be $4-50 billion each year. This project will contribute tools for controlling the spread of white-nose and the resulting losses to agriculture, as well as the serious impacts it has on the bats themselves. It is expected that the approaches and tools developed in this project for white-nose syndrome could also be applied to other wildlife diseases, as well as for the regional and continental spread of human pathogens. The scientists involved will communicate their practical findings directly to the land and natural resources managers and to the public. The project will also have educational benefits through the transfer of skills from the field of mathematics to ecology and epidemiology. The project will also provide exciting research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students."

The aim is to determine how factors that effect change?such as shifts in human demographics, desires for biodiversity and water conservation, regulations that govern water use and quality, and dispersal of organisms?will interact with factors that contribute to stability such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. The project will determine ecological implications of alternative futures of the ARM for the assembly of ecological communities, ecosystem function, and responses to environmental change and disturbance at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and continental scales. Five types of residential parcels as well as embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied, across six U.S. cities (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles). Education and outreach work will focus on K-12 teachers and students and on collaborative policy efforts with city, county, and state environmental managers.<br/><br/>This project investigates urbanization?s impact on the ecological homogenization of the American Residential Macrosystem (ARM) in terms of plant biodiversity, soil carbon and nitrogen cycle pools and processes, microclimate, hydrography, and land cover. This similarity of ecological characteristics is driven by complex and dynamic human actions at multiple scales?e.g., parcel, neighborhood, and region?that will shape the structure and function of the ARM over 50 to 100 year time frames, with potentially significant continental scale effects on ecological processes and environmental quality. This research addresses two core questions. First, what factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM? While this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests. Researchers will test the hypothesis that that although dispersal from natural and interstitial areas, climate change, and changes in homeowner knowledge will promote ecological change; institutions, norms and values will function as counteracting, stabilizing forces on these ecological dynamics. This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results will be used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM. Second, what are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?  The hypothesis to be tested is that management that promotes nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale. Five types of residential parcels that vary in management goals and intensity and embedded semi-natural interstitial ecosystems will be studied in six U.S. cities across the U.S. (Boston, Baltimore, Miami, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, and Los Angeles), to quantify influences on ecological dynamics. This information will be linked to land use scenarios to address the regional and continental-scale impacts of these effects. Three postdocs will be mentored as co-investigators on this project. The research program will also include interaction with municipal decision makers focused on sustainability and add a new ?Panel of Experts? feature to the YardMap citizen science program developed at Cornell University."

The ability to predict the effects of human activities on biodiversity remains poor because biodiversity responds differently to similar changes in environmental conditions. This project tackles an unexplored mechanism for observed highly variable responses among communities, which is the diversity of species traits in a region.  The project will contribute new insights into the responses of biodiversity to human perturbations. It will simultaneously advance conservation, management, and restoration of human-altered ecosystems both through application of research results and through new educational and training programs. Activities will include a workshop to bring together land managers and scientists from local, state, and federal institutions to identify and discuss key challenges in conservation and restoration; training of high school students, teachers, and undergraduate students in science and field research; and dissemination of a classroom module to high school teachers focused on environmental restoration and sustainability.<br/><br/>The researchers will conduct a landscape-scale field experiment to examine why the diversity and composition of plant communities change in response to fire and nutrient availability in Ozark forest ecosystems. Within this large-scale experiment, plant communities will be assembled from pools of species that vary in diversity of seed, root, stem, and leaf traits. Experimental data will be combined with spatial analyses and simulation models to test how trait diversity influences the relative importance of ecological processes underlying plant community assembly. This multi-scale approach will advance our understanding of how regional variation in species-trait diversity, landscape-scale disturbances, and local variation in environmental conditions independently and interactively shape patterns of biodiversity."

These include a few species of bryophytes, ferns, cycads, and a small group of flowering plants. Because of their importance to crops, a lot of research has focused on the relationship between legumes and the bacteria that fix nitrogen for them - rhizobia. Much less is known about an even more widespread partnership between plants and cyanobacteria. Because cyanobacteria are generally less dependent on the plant host than rhizobia, they could be an excellent partner for engineering helpful nitrogen fixation into crop plants. However, our current understanding of plant-cyanobacterium partnerships is poor. The species and genetic diversity of helpful cyanobacteria is virtually unexplored. Similarly, the plant genes involved in these partnerships remain unknown. Hornworts, one of the three bryophyte lineages, are an outstanding system to study plant-cyanobacterial relationships. This study will investigate phylogenetic, functional, and genetic aspects of the hornwort-cyanobacterium partnership. In doing so, the research will explore an array of questions that will provide new insights into how these unique plants interact with their bacterial partners to fix nitrogen. One postdoctoral fellow, three graduate, ten undergraduate, and five high school students will be trained. In partnership with the Science Teachers Association of New York State, an educational video will be made. This video will showcase the various forms of plant-cyanobacterium relationships. <br/><br/>The goals of this research are first to uncover the phylogenetic diversity of hornworts and cyanobionts. Then to elucidate the functional diversity of symbiotic nitrogen-fixation. Finally, the research will reveal the genetic components of the association between hornworts and their cyanobionts. The researchers will reconstruct the hornwort tree-of-life using a phylogenomic approach. Then, for each hornwort sample, the genetic diversity of the cyanobiont community will be characterized. Comparing the hornwort and cyanobiont diversity will shed light on host-symbiont specificity. The research will also study patterns of co-evolution, and the roles of cyanobacterial symbiosis in hornwort evolution. Next, population and microcosm studies will be used to test the interaction among hornwort microbiome diversity, environmental variables, and nitrogen-fixation rates. Finally, multiple pure hornwort and cyanobiont cultures will be isolated. Once isolated, their symbioses will be reconstituted under controlled environmental conditions in the laboratory. Time-course RNA-seq data will be generated to identify putative genes that are core for symbiosis establishment and linked to variation in symbiotic behaviors. The results of this research will enable comparisons across all three major forms of plant-microbe mutualistic interaction to fully characterize the evolutionary and genetic underpinnings of symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent discovery of a blind cavefish that walks and climbs waterfalls with a salamander-like gait and has evolved a robust pelvic girdle (a kind of hip) offers an extraordinary opportunity to study, in living fishes, a pivotal event in evolutionary history. That event, the vertebrate invasion of land, hinged on the evolution of fins to limbs that enabled the first vertebrates to walk on land. The fossil record of this transition is scarce, and extant fishes were thought to lack the morphological features necessary for studying the origin of quadrupedal walking. This research will provide a unique opportunity to understand, through phylogenetic analysis and mathematical and robotic modeling, the mechanism underlying a major event in the history of life: how fishes were able to transition to a terrestrial lifestyle and evolve into the tetrapods. The broader impacts of this project will promote teaching, training, and learning for high school students in diverse and underprivileged communities. The project will also provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research training and make important contributions to public science education. This project was co-funded by the Biology Directorate and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division.  <br/><br/>The proposed work will identify the genomic, morphological, and mechanical qualities that enable a fish to walk on land. Advancing previous work on the functional morphology and kinematics of terrestrial walking in the blind cave fish Cryptotora thamicola, the proposed research will examine the phylogenomic relationships, morphology, biomechanics, and walking performance from an evolutionary perspective among balitorid loaches. Genomic sequencing will determine convergent genetic markers known to be involved in pelvic girdle formation in other walking vertebrates. Morphological examinations will reveal how functional phenotypic adaptations can be formed by major genomic changes. A biorobotic model organism, validated through comparison with our experimental biomechanical data, will be used to take a modular approach to examining convergence and answering questions on the effect of pelvic morphology on walking performance in extinct fin-to-limb transitional forms and modern forms. The work proposed will discriminate the fundamental physical properties which are inherent to the transition to terrestrial walking from an aquatic form. The evolution of the terrestrial pelvic girdle was critical to the diversification of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals; the proposed work uses a convergent fish model to study the evolution of anatomical structures that support the vertebrate body against gravity and show how modulation of muscular control can produce a tetrapodal gait within a given range of skeletal morphologies. This research will inform scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the convergent evolution of morphological innovation, allowing development of a unifying principle for mass support in tetrapods based on the genomics, basic physics, and mechanics that define the pelvic girdle contribution to quadrupedal walking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These rapids, eddies and canyons are home to an extraordinary array of fishes, many of which are striking in appearance and exhibit numerous adaptations to life in turbulent, high-energy waters. In such extreme habitats, evolution sometimes produces independently derived yet remarkably similar traits. For example, many distantly related fishes in the lower Congo have independently lost body coloration, have reduced or absent eyes, and share similar elongate body shapes and modified sensory features. How and when did these unusual features evolve? These striking examples of convergence (when similar traits evolve independently) strongly suggest a shared signature of selection, likely in response to the extraordinary hydrology of the river itself. This research project will examine the phylogenetic and morphological basis of convergence in the lower Congo fish fauna to address fundamental questions about the mechanisms that promote adaptation and diversification in extreme environments. These analyses will provide new insights into how limbs are reduced or lost in diverse fish lineages that can then be applied more broadly to other vertebrates.  U.S. undergraduate students from a minority-serving, principally undergraduate institution will receive broad training in tropical field studies, molecular systematics, and African biodiversity more generally. Findings from the study will be incorporated within both graduate and undergraduate courses, and results will be disseminated more broadly by a Science Explorations video and project website.  Other data will be deposited in online, open-access repositories.<br/><br/>This study investigates a newly discovered system of complexin situphenotypic convergence among members of phylogenetically diverse fish lineages. Two major datasets will be generated and integrated: 1) a phylogenetic framework based on ultra-conserved elements to determine the topology and temporal framework of within-clade divergences; and 2) a detailed morphological characterization of within-group convergence utilizing a range of quantification and visualization techniques, including 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction, histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and multivariate morphometric approaches. Using these datasets, the study will investigate how rapidly these phenotypes arose, morphological correspondence of convergence within and between clades, and whether multiple traits evolved in concert. By conducting in-depth, foundational phylogenetic, anatomical, and morphometric analyses of this unparalleled natural experiment, the study will potentially transform understanding of the variety of mechanisms by which convergent phenotypes have repeatedly evolved across deep phylogenetic time. This research will also generate a broadly useful resource for future comparative studies with similar convergent systems (e.g. Astyanax cavefishes) and will establish the foundation for determining the genomic basis of these phenotypes."

The full impacts of high amounts of nitrogen deposition on ecosystems around the world are not well known. In particular, how nitrogen deposition alters the amounts and forms of carbon in soils is very poorly understood. Yet, achieving better understanding of this so-called coupling between the nitrogen and carbon cycles is important for life on earth. Plants and soils exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year and so small changes in the rate of that exchange could affect how fast carbon dioxide in the air is rising. This project will integrate results from extensive cross-site, coordinated field experiments with modeling to improve our mechanistic understanding of the coupling of belowground carbon and nitrogen in grassland ecosystems. This is a key knowledge gap for Earth system models used to predict the biogeochemical consequences of human-caused global environmental changes and to refine predictions of carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change.  This project will also connect researchers with education and outreach programs of the Cedar Creek Long-Term Ecological Research project. These programs are aimed at training K-12 students and teachers and increasing participation and retention of women and members of other underrepresented groups in science, with a special focus on mentoring undergraduate Native Americans in research. Project investigators will also mentor graduate students and post-doctoral scholars. <br/><br/>This research will use a network of decade-long nutrient addition experiments in North American grasslands, the Nutrient Network, to study how enhanced nitrogen inputs influence soil microbial dynamics, soil carbon cycling, and the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Results will be used to enhance the Microbial ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model towards determining how nitrogen inputs affect: (1) biochemical stabilization of soil organic matter (SOM) by altering the quantity and quality of plant inputs to soils, and soil microbial community structure, stoichiometry, and functional potential; and (2) physicochemical stabilization of SOM by altering soil aggregate formation and SOM-mineral interactions.  Results of computer simulation models of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling will be made available to the scientific community at large through the Accelerated Climate Model for Energy program at the Department of Energy. All data generated from the proposed work will also be made publically available through the Nutrient Network research project and the Long-Term Ecological Research network."

Many older groups of fishes were going extinct and being replaced by modern groups. But where did the modern groups come from, and how and why did they replace the older groups? These questions, among others, are unanswered because the fossil record of fishes from this time period is extremely poor. This project analyzes newly discovered, complete fossilized skeletons of freshwater fish from a critical time period (72-66 million years ago). These fossils are extraordinarily well-preserved, providing a rare glimpse of complete skeletons. This project will fill a critical gap in understanding the origin and evolution of modern freshwater fish. In addition to the scientific merit of this project, there are several broader impacts. First, the fossils to be described are deposited in publicly accessible natural history collections, thereby ensuring that they are available in perpetuity to the scientific community. Second, student training programs developed around the preparation and analysis of the fossils provides valuable research and training for budding scientists. Third, results from this study will be published in scientific articles and presented at professional meetings and seminars for public audiences. And finally, by using the resources available at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the project will increase public understanding of science. All specimens will be prepared in a lab where active preparation and study of the specimens can be observed by the more than 1.2 million annual visitors to the Field Museum, including many K-12 student groups and teachers, and a temporary exhibit of this exquisitely preserved fossil fish fauna will add an important component to current exhibits at the Field Museum. <br/><br/>Although the modern freshwater fish fauna of North America has been intensively studied, its origin, biogeography, and evolutionary history are still poorly understood, due in part to a lack of whole-body fossils from Cretaceous freshwater deposits, particularly those containing articulated skeletons. This study uses exceptionally well-preserved fossil fish from a recently discovered lagerstatten in the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, to illuminate the transition between the early Mesozoic (consisting of extinct orders and families) and the modern freshwater fauna. Recently discovered blocks containing the articulated, complete skeletons of many freshwater fish have been acquired by the Field Museum for preparation and analysis. All fossils will be described and illustrated using a combination of detailed photographic documentation of all aspects of the anatomy of the species with matched line drawings clearly showing the interpretation of the morphology. These data will form the basis of original morphological descriptions, character conceptualization, and phylogenetic and comparative analyses of key fish lineages present in the blocks, including the Acipenseridae, Polyodontidae, Amiidae, Lepisosteidae, and possibly Teleostei.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This warming has triggered large changes in the number and size of wildfires, the melting of frozen soil, patterns of water flow, and outbreaks of insects and diseases. Thus, Alaskan landscapes are changing rapidly in complex ways, which is important because the changes directly affect the availability of natural resources and ecosystem services to Alaskan residents. More generally, changes to landscapes in the far North are of global significance because boreal forests cover vast areas and play a role in determining the Earth's climate. Understanding how and why boreal forests respond as they do to a warmer world is important for predicting both regional and global changes over the next century. This Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project, started in 1987, will continue to provide long-term data on how changing climate impacts Alaskan forests and the people who depend on them for a living.  This LTER research will test new ideas and gain fresh insights of the type possible only from studies that last decades.

The project addresses the dynamics of change through the integration of five components: 1) Studying direct effects of climate change on ecosystems and disturbance regimes by characterizing controls over the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems and disturbances, and the sensitivities of these controls to regional climate, and by studying the spatial and temporal synchrony of multiple disturbances to assess which landscapes are most vulnerable to change; 2) Understanding patterns, mechanisms, and consequences for scale-dependent climate-disturbance interactions involving current and legacy influences of fire, permafrost, and trophic dynamics as drivers of ecosystem and landscape change; 3) Linking landscape heterogeneity with regional and global climate feedbacks by studying and modeling how intermediate-scale patterns and processes influence regional scale ecosystem dynamics and climate feedbacks; 4) Studying how climate variability and change are affecting coupled social-ecological dynamics by characterizing variability in changes to ecosystem services across a select group of interior Alaskan communities, and collaborating with communities to find solutions that reduce vulnerability and improve adaptation to social-ecological change; 5) Integrating science and resource management with regional environmental change by coordinating research activities with agencies to fill management knowledge gaps, assessing outcomes of policy decisions, and communicating syntheses to policy makers in meaningful ways."

If evolution is predictable, then humanity will be better able to anticipate evolutionary changes in diseases, agricultural pests, or species we wish to preserve in the face of environmental change. This study will examine the degree to which evolution is predictable. Specifically, the researchers will test whether the repeated evolution of certain traits in many replicate populations is evidence of similar natural selection, as has been widely assumed but never tested in nature. The work has broad scope, integrating environmental, ecological, morphological, immunological, and genomic data, and so will provide a benchmark for future studies of evolution. Moreover, the study organism -- the threespine stickleback fish -- is abundant, diverse, and well-studied, making it an excellent tool for teaching biology to both K-12 science teachers and their students.<br/><br/>The study asks the following questions: (1) where we observe repeated evolution, is natural selection also very similar?,  (2) do immune traits evolve in a predictable manner?, (3) does parallel natural selection act on the same genomic regions?, (4) how thoroughly can we explain genetic responses to selection? To answer these questions, the researchers will place F2 hybrids between lake and stream fish into enclosures in natural habitats, to measure selection on many traits and genomic loci. By repeating these measures of selection in four independent lake-stream pairs, they can, for the first time, evaluate the relationship between parallel selection and parallel evolution in the wild."

This is especially true of large, high value fishes that are vulnerable to overfishing because of their biology. For example, one third of shark and ray species are known to have declined in recent history, but it is unknown whether most of the remaining two-thirds are also declining, or if they are stable. Likewise, population sizes of predatory fishes such as groupers and tuna have decreased substantially due to intense fishing, yet little is known about the extent of decline and risk of extinction for some of these species. This project uses the evolutionary history of well-studied related species to provide estimates of basic demographic properties of little-studied species of fisheries and conservation importance. This knowledge provides important information to guide management efforts, such as limits on catch and trade, until more direct research can be carried out. The researchers will also engage in educational outreach on mathematical biology for undergraduates and on marine biodiversity science for the general public. <br/><br/>Scientists often have some knowledge of individual traits such as reproductive behavior, lifespan, and metabolic rates of many related fish species, even in the absence of population-level information. Evolutionary theory can predict the co-evolution of these unique trait combinations of various groups. This theory can be used to infer demographic rates and project species' status, but previous efforts have not incorporated the unique details of each species' biology. This project will develop comprehensive theory linking the evolution of these traits to species status projections for tunas, groupers, and sharks and rays. Modern statistical methods will allow information from models of data-rich species, which have formal assessments, to be shared with poorly studied species in similar habitats, or with relatives. With this new understanding of population trajectories, the team will produce recommendations for use by organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as managers and scientists."

Their rise pushed several other plant lineages to extinction or severely reduced their diversity. Ferns are the only exception to this pattern. Rather than being marginalized or driven to extinction, ferns actually thrived and diversified in both the forest understory and the newly available canopy. Ferns and lycophytes are unique among land plants in having two independent stages of the life cycle (haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte), both of which had to adapt to the new environmental conditions created by the rise of flowering plants. Many tropical, epiphytic fern gametophytes evolved to produce more leaves than their terrestrial counterparts, which enable them to live longer and to reproduce without producing spores. These are highly beneficial traits in the competitive canopy environment that may actually have enabled ferns to diversify rapidly in these habitats. The increased independence of the gametophyte means that ferns can postpone the production of sporophytes if conditions are unfavorable. As a result, in several epiphytic species we observe a pattern of spatially separated generations, in which the gametophyte can grow in a much broader range of conditions than its sporophyte. Several of these fern species with long-lived gametophytes grow in Hawaii, where ferns remain understudied. This project will investigate the ecology of these ferns in Hawaii, particularly the environmental conditions that favor the evolution of independent gametophyte populations. Temperature, light levels, and precipitation will all be measured in order to understand the ecological dynamics that govern sporophyte and gametophyte production. One graduate student and several undergraduates from the University of Florida and University of Hawaii at Manoa will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods. Results from the study will be broadly disseminated via popular science articles.<br/><br/>This research will survey sporophyte and independent gametophyte floras at five stations in the Koolau and Waianae Mountain ranges of Hawaii at 200, 400, 800, and 1,000 m intervals.

Species range shift predictions are routinely based on the direct impacts of climate change alone. But this approach is widely acknowledged as overly simplistic, excluding consideration of other abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding the complex interplay between environmental change and local ecological processes is needed to improve predictions. Paired modern and historical datasets provide a means by which suites of interacting factors affecting past range responses can be modeled and validated over multiple ecological and spatial and temporal scales. This project integrates community ecology, biogeography and biogeochemistry to address the impact of a century of environmental change on small mammals in the Great Basin, a highly threatened bioregion in North America. This project underscores the value of museum collections as ecological archives and will develop a new interactive multi-media exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Utah to highlight new uses for old specimens in ecology and conservation. Finally, this project supports women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. <br/><br/>Using paired survey data (80+ yrs separation) in Great Basin mountains, this project will determine what factors have mediated range boundary changes of small mammals. Alternate hypotheses will be evaluated regarding how the direct and indirect effects of resource use, species interactions, landcover, and climate change at the local scale have shaped landscape-scale species range dynamics. This mechanistic understanding will be developed within and across time periods, and results synthesized to identify the traits and contexts that heighten a species' sensitivity to environmental change. Structural equation modeling will investigate direct and indirect pathways through which biotic and abiotic factors affect species occurrence and abundance at local sites and range dynamics at landscape scale. Species distribution models will be used to hindcast past species ranges in altered climates. Stable isotope analysis will be used to infer differences in diet and habitat use over time, between mountain ranges, and in the presence/absence of competitors. Mammal stable isotope analyses will be done with museum specimens. This project will facilitate the training of a post-doctoral researcher and students as well as a museum outreach exhibit. The methods and findings will be highly generalizable to other groups and systems and will generate robust and transferrable predictions of how species and communities are likely to respond to future climate and land-use scenarios. Consequently, project results will be directly relevant to conservation and management regarding the role of biotic interactions and resource requirements in mediating responses to environmental change."

A critical consequence of this loss is that the only remnants of many ecosystems are small fragments of once continuous habitat, and so the fate of biodiversity, globally, depends on the survival of species in fragments of habitat. Therefore, understanding the fate of species in habitat fragments is imperative. Experimental studies of extinction are extremely rare outside of the laboratory. Thus, long term and large scale habitat fragmentation experiments provide real world understanding of extinction that cannot be uncovered in any other way. The Wog Wog experiment in southeastern Australia is the longest running, large scale experiment in temperate forest, fragmented since 1987. The experiment has provided major insights about which kinds of species are at greatest risk of extinction when their habitat is fragmented. The site is composed of original native eucalypt forest fragments now set within managed commercial pine plantation. These commercial pines are scheduled to be harvested, creating an unprecedented opportunity to discover, in an experimental setting, how extinction risk changes when fragments are re-fragmented, something that occurs commonly in practice. The researchers will determine how re-fragmentation impacts the extinction risk of species on fragments through changes to the environment and the ecosystem function of fragments. <br/><br/>Many university students will only take one science class, and often that class is Introductory Biology. Dr. Davies co-teaches 1400 Introductory Biology students every year and so has a great opportunity to inspire and increase STEM participation. She will transform the teaching of her large undergraduate biology class by focusing learning around her research at Wog Wog by: 1) focusing on established learning goals, developing mini case studies around video shot by graduate students in the field, and 2) bringing an undergraduate into the field every year to collect habitat structure data through digital photos that will be analysed by the whole class, and used by the PI to model changes to the environment. Dr. Davies hypothesizes that having real-world, real-time biology embedded in class will increase engagement and learning gains."

These inhabitants were long invisible to scientists studying plants, but with the advancement of DNA-based assessment tools, researchers have discovered an increasing diversity of organisms that reside inside healthy plants. Endophytes include hundreds of microbial species (bacteria and fungi) that live in healthy wood inside standing trees. Some provide benefits to the host tree, but others, particularly fungi, may attack and/or weaken trees (pathogens) or may try to get a head start decomposing wood (saprotrophs). In addition, there are many microbes present as endophytes with functions that have yet to be determined. Determining these functions is a critical need for predicting the risk of tree hazards, and for modeling rates of decomposition and carbon released once a tree dies. Accurately predicting wood decay is difficult and presents a significant uncertainty in carbon cycle models. To improve predictive power, it is necessary to model a key transition that occurs when a tree dies a natural death, killing many endophytes but exposing a payoff to others that rise to dominate these subsequent microbial communities, particularly saprotrophs. This research makes use of a natural disturbance event, the great deal of tree damage created by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, to study how endophytes shape the fungal decomposition communities that develop post-disturbance. With this knowledge, it is possible not only to improve decomposition models but also better predict endophyte success, an asset for predicting tree hazard risks in future hurricanes. The project also offers opportunities for STEM training of several female team members, including Puerto Rican collaborators affected by Hurricane Maria. It will also lead to production of a public video describing the science, the scientists, and the role of endophytes in tree hazards and decomposition processes in nature.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to track the development of tree endophyte fungi post-hurricane in Puerto Rico's Guanica Forest scientific area, and to correlate this process with environmental variables and wood traits (e.g. nitrogen content). There are three specific objectives to reach this goal, 1) rapid-response sampling to assess fungal communities present at time zero, 2) tracking communities at two additional time points to assess persistence of endophytes, and 3) matching outcomes over one year to site climate data (temperature, rainfall) and to wood substrate physiochemistry. This study includes wood sections from 14 tree species, either cut and left in ground contact to decay along a transect or remaining standing as a stump section. A key hypothesis is that endophyte saprotrophs will have a greater influence on decomposition in standing sections rather than in ground contact, but that the overall rates of decomposition will be influenced by climate and wood physiochemical variables, particularly wood nitrogen and heartwood content. The study design allows coupling of community structure and function with host traits over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fertilizer plant waste carries microorganisms that grow well in high-N conditions; thus, the concurrent addition of N and unique microbes could enhance microbiological N removal activity within the river, and will advance understanding of the connections between microbial community composition and riverine nitrogen cycling. This is a significant frontier in ecosystem science with high potential to improve mechanistic understanding of future changes in ecosystem structure and function. To accomplish these goals, the research uses two approaches. First, the relationship between changes in river water quality and changes in river water microbial communities will be measured over time and compared to unaffected sections of the river. Second, in order to directly test whether different microbial populations have different effects on water quality, lab experiments will compare N removal in waters inoculated with microorganisms from either the river or fertilizer waste ponds. This project focuses on a uniquely well-defined release of water with distinct chemistry and microbial composition, which enables clear tracking of the effect of altered N input and microbial community composition on river water quality. This research will teach us whether knowing water microbial community composition helps predict water quality in a large river. This project supports direct engagement between research scientists and their local municipality and watershed organization to learn about controls on water quality. It also gives graduate and undergraduate students hands-on experience collecting, synthesizing and interpreting data on river chemistry and microbiology.<br/> <br/>To reach project goals, the researchers will deploy a suite of sensors (nitrate and dissolved oxygen) and automated water samplers, and collect grab samples to characterize downstream changes in river biogeochemistry and microbial community composition. Also, the researchers will filter live microbial cells from river and fertilizer waste water and use these cells to inoculate replicated lab incubation chambers that contain different N concentrations. Response variables measured in both field and lab activities include: water chemistry, nitrification and denitrification rate potentials, total bacterial and archaeal community composition, nitrification and denitrification functional gene abundance. This work offers a unique opportunity to better understand how large rivers transport and transform nutrients in the face of altered nutrient inputs and microbial loads, a key gap in our understanding of lotic nutrient cycling. Also, because nitrification and denitrification rates are limited by different environmental factors, the work will provide insight on biological versus geochemical controls over two key processes supporting total N removal from aquatic ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the last decade, great progress has been made in identifying the species of microbes present in many environments. In addition, many of the genes that control what these microbes do have been discovered. This research will uncover how microbes control critical ecosystem services. This project will develop a new modeling framework to combine information about microbial activities with environmental data from sensor networks. This approach will advance understanding of how microbes control cycles of elements and the flow of energy on Earth. This work will create valuable tools for managing natural ecosystems and industrial processes. The project will also support undergraduate research as part of the Semester in Environmental Science program at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.<br/><br/>In most natural microbial systems, details of microbial metabolic and regulatory networks will remain unknown in the foreseeable future and are too complex to be folded into models of climate, soil fertility for agriculture, or waste management. Rather, development of a scalable biogeochemical modeling approach is critical for detecting the principles by which complex soil systems operate under co-control by microbes and environmental factors. This project will develop a flexible framework for analyzing microbial biogeochemistry from the thermodynamic perspective of maximum entropy production (MEP). The work takes advantage of the high diversity of microbial communities to enable thermodynamically-based predictions about system-level biogeochemical response to global change. The planned thermodynamically-constrained metabolic modeling approach will address two key challenges associated with modeling microbial communities: (1) capturing community self-organization and expression of metabolic function, and (2) re-parameterizing reaction kinetics dynamically as microbial community composition shifts in response to local environmental conditions.  The distributed metabolic network modeling approach features a minimal set of optimal control variables that vary over time and space. These variables control stoichiometry and thermodynamics of a distributed metabolic network as well as reaction rates.  To leverage existing modeling and experimental work for model-measurement comparisons, the first phase of research will focus on a simplified network including methanogenesis and methanotrophy.  Ultimately, the goal is to integrate sensor-derived information with diverse, known microbial capabilities (constrained by thermodynamic principles), to predict shifting activities of microbial communities in soils using far fewer parameters than would be required with conventional modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These die-off events have altered forest and woodland ecosystems. This includes changes in water and energy fluxes and losses in ecosystem services in many areas. The ability to predict how forests will respond to drought is key for applying rapid land management actions to mitigate undesired outcomes. One goal of this research is to improve mortality predictions for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis) in response to drought. This will be achieved through a watering experiment and a regional survey during an emerging snow drought in the US Southwest. Multiple predictions of pi?on mortality in response to drought have already been developed. Another goal of this research is to use near-term ecological forecasting to test these different predictions. Throughout the drought, forecasts of the likelihood of tree mortality based on these different predictions will be done at intervals of 1 week to 1 year. This project will engage the public, land managers, and scientists through a website that is updated weekly with tree mortality forecasts. This project will develop and implement a teaching module to enhance undergraduate curricula and provide education training for a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>An emerging frontier of ecosystem science in the face of environmental change is to predict not just ecological responses to trends but to predict extreme ecological events to extreme climate events. Among the most important and extensive of such events is tree die-off in response to drought, warming and associated pests and pathogens. Although much research has focused simply on what exceeds thresholds for tree mortality, yielding numerous potential predictive relationships, none of these relationships have been tested with near-term ecological forecasting. Further, field experiments that have attempted to impose drought largely have been ineffective at improving predictions or testing near-term forecasts due to the challenges of effectively mimicking a severe drought or simultaneous mortality of treated and controls plots. There is thus a critical need for an experiment that takes advantage of a developing extreme drought to test multiple alternate hypotheses in a near-term ecological forecasting context. This project will rapidly implement experimental and monitoring measurements concurrent with the severe snow drought emerging across the southwestern US to test multiple predictions of tree mortality for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis), the most intensively studied tree species for drought-induced mortality.

These die-off events have altered forest and woodland ecosystems. This includes changes in water and energy fluxes and losses in ecosystem services in many areas. The ability to predict how forests will respond to drought is key for applying rapid land management actions to mitigate undesired outcomes. One goal of this research is to improve mortality predictions for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis) in response to drought. This will be achieved through a watering experiment and a regional survey during an emerging snow drought in the US Southwest. Multiple predictions of pi?on mortality in response to drought have already been developed. Another goal of this research is to use near-term ecological forecasting to test these different predictions. Throughout the drought, forecasts of the likelihood of tree mortality based on these different predictions will be done at intervals of 1 week to 1 year. This project will engage the public, land managers, and scientists through a website that is updated weekly with tree mortality forecasts. This project will develop and implement a teaching module to enhance undergraduate curricula and provide education training for a postdoctoral researcher.  <br/><br/>An emerging frontier of ecosystem science in the face of environmental change is to predict not just ecological responses to trends but to predict extreme ecological events to extreme climate events. Among the most important and extensive of such events is tree die-off in response to drought, warming and associated pests and pathogens. Although much research has focused simply on what exceeds thresholds for tree mortality, yielding numerous potential predictive relationships, none of these relationships have been tested with near-term ecological forecasting. Further, field experiments that have attempted to impose drought largely have been ineffective at improving predictions or testing near-term forecasts due to the challenges of effectively mimicking a severe drought or simultaneous mortality of treated and controls plots. There is thus a critical need for an experiment that takes advantage of a developing extreme drought to test multiple alternate hypotheses in a near-term ecological forecasting context. This project will rapidly implement experimental and monitoring measurements concurrent with the severe snow drought emerging across the southwestern US to test multiple predictions of tree mortality for pi?on pine (Pinus edulis), the most intensively studied tree species for drought-induced mortality. Near-term ecological forecasting will be updated at intervals of 1 week to 1 year throughout the drought, based on the frequency of available input data.

This research addresses two core questions. First, what factors contribute to maintenance and change in the ARM? While this macrosystem is a relatively homogeneous mixture of grass lawns, shrubs, trees and impervious surfaces, there is a critical need to determine how drivers of change such as shifts in human population and ethnicity, increasing desires for biodiversity and water conservation, and regulations governing water use and quality will interact with stabilizing factors such as social norms, property values, neighborhood and city covenants and laws, and commercial interests.

This hypothesis will be tested by evaluating the factors that motivate change and stability at multiple scales. Results will be used to produce quantitative, data-based scenarios of future land-use patterns in the ARM. Second, what are the ecological implications of alternative futures of this macrosystem for community assembly and ecosystem function at parcel (ecosystem), landscape (city), regional (Metropolitan Statistical Area), and continental scales?  The hypothesis to be tested is that management that promotes nutrient- and water-use efficient and wildlife-supporting plants as well as lower inputs of water and nutrients will give rise to greater regional biodiversity across trophic levels, higher nutrient retention, lower water use, and reduced runoff and losses of soil carbon and nitrogen from residential yards at the regional scale.

Since this discovery antibiotics have been a boon for human health as well as for agricultural livestock production. In fact, the latter utilizes 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States, a staggering 33 million pounds a year. Most of these antibiotics and antibiotic derivatives ultimately enter the environment, leading to the assertion that no environment on earth is free from the influence of agricultural antibiotics. Despite this, little research has examined the environmental influence agricultural antibiotics are likely to have, for example, on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they mediate. This research will determine the effect antibiotics have on soil food webs and ecosystem processes both now and in an uncertain future. While examining the environmental implications of antibiotics, this project will include training at the graduate student and postdoctoral levels, and develop an authentic, expeditionary style curriculum that can be integrated across multiple middle schools which enables students to actively participate in research. <br/><br/>Using a combined set of survey, field, and lab experiments this research will determine: 1) biogeographic patterns of the soil resistome (i.e. the collection and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes); 2) the implications of antibiotics for soil food webs and ecosystem processes; and 3) the interaction between antibiotic inputs and temperature changes. Soil microbial communities are central to the healthy functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, these communities are likely to be markedly affected by antibiotic inputs derived from exogenous sources. For instance, antibiotic inputs may alter microbial efficiency leading to lower ecosystem carbon and nutrient retention, affect soil food web structure and community interactions, and potentially influence the response of soil microbial communities to global environmental change. This research is designed to investigate the potentially important, but under-studied, role antibiotic inputs have on terrestrial ecosystems. Additionally, this research seeks to better understand the susceptibility of particular soil communities and ecosystem function to antibiotic perturbation. The results gained from this research will lead to a more complete understanding of the potential impact antibiotic inputs have on soil community structure and function, and the implication of these inputs in the future. In addition to training a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher, the educational component of this project will expose middle school students -- a student population that is at a critical juncture in deciding their lifetime career objectives, but often not actively engaged in science -- to multiple curricular modules that aim to increase their knowledge of soil, microbial, and ecosystem ecology. These young students will also be active participants in the project by collecting data and conducting research directly related to the scientific objectives of this project. Overall this project will elucidate the environmental implications of antibiotics while also providing a foundation in scientific discovery for middle school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project promotes the progress of science by expanding research on animal weaponry into an unexplored group of fishes called sculpins.  Sculpins have large and variable head spines.  It is assumed that they use them to fight and compete for mates or to defend themselves from being eaten by predators. The latter has been assumed, but never tested.  This project will be first study of its kind in an aquatic system, and it will help determine whether the evolution of spines follows the same rules and patterns discovered in terrestrial systems. The project will benefit society by offering numerous educational experiences, including research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, a new version of a previously successful training workshop, and a travelling class that uses 3D visualization of animal weapons to excite precollege students about biology. It will also open access to scientific data by making 3D reconstructions of the skeleton of nearly 1000 CT scanned fish specimens publicly and freely available. Because of its novel combination of disciplines and methods, the project has the potential to pioneer a scientific approach that may become a new community standard. <br/><br/>A team of experts in ichthyology, comparative phylogenetic analysis, macroevolution, biomechanics and 3D morphometrics will unite these disciplines to discover why the heads of sculpins bear impressively variable preopercular spines. Have these fishes evolved their weapons to escalate and enhance male-male competition? Or, do the spines defend their bearers from engulfment by gape-limited predators? To answer that question the project will link microCT scans of more than 150 species, synthetic phylogenies, and databases of functional trait diversity to reconstruct the history of spine evolution in these fishes. Further, it will shed light on the generality of rules governing the evolution of cranial appendages in these fishes follows those discovered in terrestrial systems."

These rapids, eddies and canyons are home to an extraordinary array of fishes, many of which are striking in appearance and exhibit numerous adaptations to life in turbulent, high-energy waters. In such extreme habitats, evolution sometimes produces independently derived yet remarkably similar traits. For example, many distantly related fishes in the lower Congo have independently lost body coloration, have reduced or absent eyes, and share similar elongate body shapes and modified sensory features. How and when did these unusual features evolve? These striking examples of convergence (when similar traits evolve independently) strongly suggest a shared signature of selection, likely in response to the extraordinary hydrology of the river itself. This research project will examine the phylogenetic and morphological basis of convergence in the lower Congo fish fauna to address fundamental questions about the mechanisms that promote adaptation and diversification in extreme environments. These analyses will provide new insights into how limbs are reduced or lost in diverse fish lineages that can then be applied more broadly to other vertebrates.  U.S. undergraduate students from a minority-serving, principally undergraduate institution will receive broad training in tropical field studies, molecular systematics, and African biodiversity more generally. Findings from the study will be incorporated within both graduate and undergraduate courses, and results will be disseminated more broadly by a Science Explorations video and project website.  Other data will be deposited in online, open-access repositories.<br/><br/>This study investigates a newly discovered system of complexin situphenotypic convergence among members of phylogenetically diverse fish lineages. Two major datasets will be generated and integrated: 1) a phylogenetic framework based on ultra-conserved elements to determine the topology and temporal framework of within-clade divergences; and 2) a detailed morphological characterization of within-group convergence utilizing a range of quantification and visualization techniques, including 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) reconstruction, histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and multivariate morphometric approaches. Using these datasets, the study will investigate how rapidly these phenotypes arose, morphological correspondence of convergence within and between clades, and whether multiple traits evolved in concert. By conducting in-depth, foundational phylogenetic, anatomical, and morphometric analyses of this unparalleled natural experiment, the study will potentially transform understanding of the variety of mechanisms by which convergent phenotypes have repeatedly evolved across deep phylogenetic time. This research will also generate a broadly useful resource for future comparative studies with similar convergent systems (e.g. Astyanax cavefishes) and will establish the foundation for determining the genomic basis of these phenotypes."

The goal of the North Temperate Lakes (NTL) Long-Term Ecological Research Program is to understand how and why lakes change over time and to determine the consequences of these changes for these and other basic services. The research focuses on two sets of lakes and their surrounding landscapes. One set lies in the rural, forested, and tourist-dominated Northern Highland Lake District in northern Wisconsin and the other lies in the agricultural and urban landscape around Madison, Wisconsin's capitol. Studies of these contrasting settings provide insights into how individual lakes and groups of lakes across landscapes and regions are affected by phenomena such as shifting climate conditions, large storm events, invasive species, harmful algal blooms, urbanization, and changes in environmental policies. The project implements a number of different approaches to collect data over long time periods and to analyze these long-term observations. Results improve understanding of ecological change in lake districts that is important to anyone concerned with the future of a particular region, its freshwater resources, and the welfare of its residents. Results are also integrated into multiple educational and training activities. The NTL program is committed to supporting diversity in science, and to outreach efforts that communicate scientific findings and expertise to broad audiences, informing individuals, non-governmental organizations, academics, and local, state and federal agencies. <br/><br/>The project will address the overarching question of how biophysical setting, climate, and land use and cover interact to shape lake dynamics and organization in the past, present and future.  Activities will be organized in thematic areas that involve (1) documenting, describing, and interpreting long term change in lakes and lake districts; (2) exploring how past and potential future climate conditions influence lake physical, chemical, and biological processes; (3) understanding how and why long-term changes vary spatially within and among lakes; and (4) examining how lakes and lake districts respond to sudden changes, extreme events, or interacting drivers. The work informs and is informed by concepts and models from landscape ecology, disturbance ecology, and multiple causation. Questions will be addressed across a range of scales and topics, including within-lake changes in thermal regime and fish habitat in response to climate, abundance-impact relationships for aquatic invasive species among lakes; watershed organic carbon and phosphorus dynamics, regional water clarity trends, and many others. Research approaches include generating and analyzing long-term observations, experiments, comparative studies of multiple lakes, and diverse modeling and statistical tools. The research group comprises an interdisciplinary team with expertise in biogeochemistry, climatology, paleolimnology, demography, ecology (landscape, ecosystem, community, population, and paleo- ecology), economics, education and outreach, hydrodynamics, hydrology, information management, and microbiology. The multi-scale, multi-faceted NTL research program is designed to detect patterns of long-term change, evaluate and advance concepts to understand causes and consequences of these changes, and build forward-looking models and hypotheses that will be tested using future long-term observations."

Species range shift predictions are routinely based on the direct impacts of climate change alone. But this approach is widely acknowledged as overly simplistic, excluding consideration of other abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding the complex interplay between environmental change and local ecological processes is needed to improve predictions. Paired modern and historical datasets provide a means by which suites of interacting factors affecting past range responses can be modeled and validated over multiple ecological and spatial and temporal scales. This project integrates community ecology, biogeography and biogeochemistry to address the impact of a century of environmental change on small mammals in the Great Basin, a highly threatened bioregion in North America. This project underscores the value of museum collections as ecological archives and will develop a new interactive multi-media exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Utah to highlight new uses for old specimens in ecology and conservation. Finally, this project supports women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. <br/><br/>Using paired survey data (80+ yrs separation) in Great Basin mountains, this project will determine what factors have mediated range boundary changes of small mammals. Alternate hypotheses will be evaluated regarding how the direct and indirect effects of resource use, species interactions, landcover, and climate change at the local scale have shaped landscape-scale species range dynamics. This mechanistic understanding will be developed within and across time periods, and results synthesized to identify the traits and contexts that heighten a species' sensitivity to environmental change. Structural equation modeling will investigate direct and indirect pathways through which biotic and abiotic factors affect species occurrence and abundance at local sites and range dynamics at landscape scale. Species distribution models will be used to hindcast past species ranges in altered climates. Stable isotope analysis will be used to infer differences in diet and habitat use over time, between mountain ranges, and in the presence/absence of competitors. Mammal stable isotope analyses will be done with museum specimens. This project will facilitate the training of a post-doctoral researcher and students as well as a museum outreach exhibit. The methods and findings will be highly generalizable to other groups and systems and will generate robust and transferrable predictions of how species and communities are likely to respond to future climate and land-use scenarios. Consequently, project results will be directly relevant to conservation and management regarding the role of biotic interactions and resource requirements in mediating responses to environmental change."

Terrestrial ecosystems are known to vary dramatically in their responses to drought, and understanding why there are such big differences is very important for predicting the impacts of drought in a region or across North America.  To effectively forecast how terrestrial ecosystems such as deserts, grasslands, and forests will respond to drought, ecologists must first study how each system responds to drought of a given severity, and then improve existing models by incorporating the factors that cause the large variation that has been seen in response to drought in past studies. Traditional site-based research by a single investigator working at a given site cannot provide this knowledge, as different methods are used in different studies. Coordinated experimental networks, with identical protocols and comparable measurements, are ideally suited for comparative studies at regional to global scales. This project will establish the Drought-Net Research Coordination Network to advance understanding of the determinants of terrestrial ecosystem responses to drought by bringing together an international group of scientists to conduct three complementary research coordination activities: 1) planning and coordinating new research using standardized measurements to leverage the value of existing drought experiments across the globe, 2) finalizing the design and facilitating the establishment of a new international network of coordinated drought experiments, and 3) training highly motivated graduate students to conduct synthetic and network-level research through Distributed Graduate Seminars focused on drought. Merging data from these activities will be an important activity conducted by Drought-Net participants in all career stages, particularly graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>Drought has social, human health, and economic impacts for people in the United States and around the world. Because climate change may increase the frequency or severity of drought, understanding the effects that droughts have on the sustainability of forests and grasslands is becoming an urgent issue. Drought-Net will focus on establishing international collaborations among researchers who study these challenges. The Distributed Graduate Seminars will train the next generation of global change scientists in collaborative synthetic and network-level research, with emphasis on increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups and geographic regions. Open calls for participation in network events and network-related products (datasets, newsletters, papers, reports, etc.) will be posted on the Drought-Net website, to encourage access by the broader scientific community and the general public. Finally, Drought-Net will partner with the ""Ask-A-Biologist"" program at Arizona State University to create articles and companion activities centered around drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. With its large Web footprint of 1.5 million visitors per year and links to science educators, broader impacts will be extended into the area of K-12 and life-long learners."

These inhabitants were long invisible to scientists studying plants, but with the advancement of DNA-based assessment tools, researchers have discovered an increasing diversity of organisms that reside inside healthy plants. Endophytes include hundreds of microbial species (bacteria and fungi) that live in healthy wood inside standing trees. Some provide benefits to the host tree, but others, particularly fungi, may attack and/or weaken trees (pathogens) or may try to get a head start decomposing wood (saprotrophs). In addition, there are many microbes present as endophytes with functions that have yet to be determined. Determining these functions is a critical need for predicting the risk of tree hazards, and for modeling rates of decomposition and carbon released once a tree dies. Accurately predicting wood decay is difficult and presents a significant uncertainty in carbon cycle models. To improve predictive power, it is necessary to model a key transition that occurs when a tree dies a natural death, killing many endophytes but exposing a payoff to others that rise to dominate these subsequent microbial communities, particularly saprotrophs. This research makes use of a natural disturbance event, the great deal of tree damage created by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, to study how endophytes shape the fungal decomposition communities that develop post-disturbance. With this knowledge, it is possible not only to improve decomposition models but also better predict endophyte success, an asset for predicting tree hazard risks in future hurricanes. The project also offers opportunities for STEM training of several female team members, including Puerto Rican collaborators affected by Hurricane Maria. It will also lead to production of a public video describing the science, the scientists, and the role of endophytes in tree hazards and decomposition processes in nature.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to track the development of tree endophyte fungi post-hurricane in Puerto Rico's Guanica Forest scientific area, and to correlate this process with environmental variables and wood traits (e.g. nitrogen content). There are three specific objectives to reach this goal, 1) rapid-response sampling to assess fungal communities present at time zero, 2) tracking communities at two additional time points to assess persistence of endophytes, and 3) matching outcomes over one year to site climate data (temperature, rainfall) and to wood substrate physiochemistry. This study includes wood sections from 14 tree species, either cut and left in ground contact to decay along a transect or remaining standing as a stump section. A key hypothesis is that endophyte saprotrophs will have a greater influence on decomposition in standing sections rather than in ground contact, but that the overall rates of decomposition will be influenced by climate and wood physiochemical variables, particularly wood nitrogen and heartwood content. The study design allows coupling of community structure and function with host traits over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evidence supports the scenario where cells of different microbial lineages (archea and bacteria) merged to form the first eukaryotic cell. Recently, genomes belonging to new lineages of life, collectively called ""Asgard"" microorganisms, have been discovered. Surprisingly, the addition of these organisms to the tree of life have revealed a close relationship to eukaryotes, suggesting they played important roles in the origin of eukaryotes. Characterization of these genomes has detected genes previously only seen in more complex cellular life. Because currently none of the Asgard microorganism can be grown in the laboratory, this project will harness high-throughput sequencing techniques for a targeted discovery of these microorganisms from deep-sea sediments. These data will result in a more comprehensive catalog of Asgard genomes, and will be used to infer their physiological capabilities and to understand the genetic composition of their ancestor. This research will provide new insights into the biodiversity and metabolisms of Asgard microbes in deep ocean floor hydrothermal communities, and will add fundamental insights into the origin of complex eukaryotic life. This project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students, and will include outreach to the general public via the South Texas Science and public lectures at sciene centers in Texas.  <br/><br/>Recently, genomes (Heimdallarchaeota, Thorarchaeota, Odinarchaeota, and Lokiarchaeota phyla) belonging to the novel archaeal superphylum ""Asgard"" have been obtained from several anoxic environments. Surprisingly, phylogenomic analyses revealed Asgard is closely related to eukaryotes, suggesting that these organisms are descendants of the ancestral archaeal host. These Asgard phyla contain a variety of genes that encode for eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs). ESPs are similar to eukaryotic proteins involved in a variety of processes including cytoskeletal formation, vesicular trafficking, protein translocation, and glycosylation, suggesting that archaea are the origin of some of the cellular complexity of eukaryotic cells. Because only few Asgard genomes are currently available, this project aims to do additional high-throughput sequencing and reconstruction of genomes from deep-sea sediments to obtain a more comprehensive genomic catalog of the Asgard superphylum. These additional genomes will be used to better resolve the phylogenetic relatedness of these archaea to eukaryotes. Researchers will also catalog the full repertoire of ESPs to better resolve their roles in the origin of cellular complexity. Finally, this project will resolve the physiological capabilities of these archaea and model the ancestral state of the Asgards. This will advance our understanding of the physiological capabilities of the last common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes. Determining the modern and ancestral physiological states of these archaea will transform our understanding of the origin of eukaryotes."

It represents a bottleneck in the vital flow of energy and limiting nutrients with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. Carrion constitutes a critical resource for a variety of communities and it strongly affects scavenger guilds, the maintenance of biodiversity, and fundamental ecological processes. This research will investigate the poorly understood role of predation in controlling carrion resources, shaping carcass distributions, and generating a shifting mosaic of biogeochemical and community activity. Two interrelated sets of questions will be addressed across four terrestrial ecosystems: 1) How do carrion-derived effects vary across multiple ecosystems and across a diversity of predator-prey communities? And 2) How does predation influence carrion distribution across space and time? Experiments and field studies will reveal above and belowground carrion effects across key biomes. This understanding will be coupled with spatial records of carcasses to examine predator control of carrion resources across multiple scales. Data from experiments, field studies and carcass records will be incorporated into spatial models to examine predator-carrion dynamics and predation controls over carrion resource flow compared to die-offs. The focal systems span a range of ecosystems and predator-prey diversity, and will yield both general patterns and identify distinct differences in predator control of carrion resources across biomes.  In examining predator control of carrion resources, this work addresses both the fundamental focus in ecology on  mechanisms of trophic control of community and ecosystem structure and explores a novel concept that can add to a comprehensive view of the ecological role of predators."

Small-scale fisheries, in particular, are incredibly important; they employ more than 90 percent of the world's approximately 35 million capture fishermen worldwide, and contribute over half of the world's marine and inland fish catch, nearly all of which is used for direct human consumption. Small-scale fisheries shape coastal cultures, economies, and ecosystems. Yet knowledge of small-scale fisheries is notoriously poor, in part because they often are marginalized within their own communities and nations. With the increasing emphasis on reconciling food security and other development aims with environmental conservation, integrated understanding of small-scale fisheries is more critical than ever. This research project will develop fundamental knowledge of human-environment interactions in coastal marine systems, and help inform the development and evaluation of innovative small-scale fisheries management strategies.  Specifically, this research will examine how environmental and economic variability and institutional diversity shape the resilience and adaptive capacity of the coupled natural and human systems associated with the small-scale fisheries.<br/><br/>This work will focus on the reciprocal interactions between the ecosystems and institutions associated with small-scale fisheries in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur (BCS). BCS is an ideal model system in which to investigate these human-ecosystem dynamics, given its variability of institutional, economic, and ecological contexts. For most fishermen in BCS, access to necessary capital inputs (boats, gear, etc.) is achieved either through membership in a fishing-cooperative or via a relationship with a patron. Both empirical evidence and theory suggest that fisheries dominated by cooperatives may contribute to improved ecosystem and human wellbeing outcomes, relative to those dominated by patron-client relationships. But the mechanisms underlying these differences and how they may contribute to resilience of human and natural systems to environmental and economic variability are not well understood, nor have they been well tested empirically. This work will address these gaps by integrating field and synthetic investigations at the scale of individual fishing communities throughout BCS. This work will generate new social and ecological data including information on fish abundances and distributions, indicators of ecological resilience and ecosystem health, information on fishermen activities and community characteristics, indicators of institutional resilience, and indicators of individual and community well-being. The project will also create targeted dynamic models of key human-environment interactions that will address core issues in coupled human-natural system science, ecology, economics, and common-pools resources studies."

This pattern is often explained in terms of temperature, climate, or geological conditions. Less frequently, the latitudinal gradient is described in terms of biotic interactions; interactions between different organisms. This research investigates a particular biotic interaction, the lichen symbiosis, along a large environmental gradient from North to South America. Lichens are symbioses (mutually beneficial, long-term, close physical associations) between fungi and algae/cyanobacteria. Though small and often overlooked, lichens can be found in almost every terrestrial environment, making them ideal for investigating biotic interactions across large environmental gradients. This research will focus on the role of symbiosis in driving patterns of diversity, and may improve predictions of how patterns of diversity change in the face of ongoing changes in climate. This research uniquely addresses both partners in the symbiosis, and will increase our knowledge of global biodiversity through the discovery and description of new species and traits. This project will extend the research and training of a doctoral student by supporting research that moves from descriptive pattern to mechanistic process. A workshop on symbioses will be made available to undergraduate students in Michigan, and educational materials for high school classrooms will be offered via the Data Nugget program, promoting the scientific process and potentially recruiting more students to science and technology at the college level. <br/><br/>The biotic interactions hypothesis proposes that in extra-tropical regions, abiotic selective pressures exert a stronger force, whereas in tropical regions, biotic selective pressures exert a stronger force. Furthermore, these biotic interactions lead to moving peaks of adaptation, and coevolutionary races, which further contributes to diversification in the tropics. This research investigates the dynamics of the lichen symbiosis along a latitudinal gradient by sequencing both the fungal and algal partners within five lichen-forming families of fungi found along the latitudinal gradient in order to map patterns of specificity among partners, and to test whether partner switches have resulted in diversification events or range shifts in the lichen symbiosis."

Although this phenomenon is clearly relevant for basic and applied biology, it is currently not well understood. This project addresses this issue by exploring patterns of biological diversity in the sap-sucking bug species of North America. Specifically, it tests the idea that both the high species diversity and the narrow diets of plant-eating insects are the result of co-evolutionary interactions with plants. These interactions are analogous to an arms race; plants evolve diverse defenses against plant-eating insects, which, in turn, evolve diverse (and specific) ways of overcoming those defenses. This idea has been central to explanations of plant-eating insect diversity for more than half a century. But until recently, researchers have lacked the resources to test it. This project will pull together those resources, and give us an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of the forces that generate biological diversity. This project will provide education and training opportunities for biology students and instructors at multiple career levels, and from multiple backgrounds.The goal is to train biodiversity scientists, and to improve access to biodiversity science for underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This project aims to identify ecological factors that drive host-use evolution and speciation in plant-eating insects. It uses Nearctic aphids as a model system and has three objectives: 1) Use DNA sequence data to estimate phylogenetic relationships among ~500 aphid species. 2) Use more than a quarter of a million specimen records and the primary research literature to characterize the niche of each Nearctic aphid species. 3) Use comparative statistical analyses to test hypotheses about the evolution of aphid species and niches. Corollary objectives are to improve aphid systematics and gain insights into the general evolutionary processes that beget biodiversity. This research may enable researchers to gain insights into economically important aspects of aphid biology, such as disease vector capacity and invasiveness.  In turn, these may lead to better strategies for excluding and controlling aphid populations, which could increase the efficiency and sustainability of U.S. agriculture."

Likewise, population sizes of predatory fishes such as groupers and tuna have decreased substantially due to intense fishing, yet little is known about the extent of decline and risk of extinction for some of these species. This project uses the evolutionary history of well-studied related species to provide estimates of basic demographic properties of little-studied species of fisheries and conservation importance. This knowledge provides important information to guide management efforts, such as limits on catch and trade, until more direct research can be carried out. The researchers will also engage in educational outreach on mathematical biology for undergraduates and on marine biodiversity science for the general public. <br/><br/>Scientists often have some knowledge of individual traits such as reproductive behavior, lifespan, and metabolic rates of many related fish species, even in the absence of population-level information.

This is determined by the rate at which dead wood is formed and the rate at which it breaks down, or decomposes. Dead wood is also a hotspot for other nutrients to accumulate and it is a home for many species of animals, plants and microbes.  Because trees contain a lot of carbon, our understanding of how the carbon cycle might be changing requires a better understanding of the wood decomposition process.  With that in mind, this project will decompose logs from five common US tree species across a gradient spanning northeastern to southeastern US temperate forests. Potential controls on wood decomposition rates will be manipulated experimentally, such as the density of dead wood and the types of wood-decomposing fungi growing on the logs.  Other factors, such as soil nutrient content, temperature and moisture will be monitored. The tree logs will be collected after a year of decay in the field and brought into the laboratory to assess their decomposition extent and associated wood-decaying fungi. The data will then be analyzed to determine wood decomposition rates under the different conditions.  Information from this project will be used to refine predictions of carbon-cycle changes and the effects of environmental change on forests. The results will also provide guidance to the forest industry on management of dead wood stocks in forest.The importance of natural wood decay will be communicated through a collaborative effort with the Peabody Museum of Natural History, by creating ""living"" dead wood exhibits for public display and use in educating visiting middle-school students. The project will also train both graduate and undergraduate students in research, and will work with high-school summer interns from groups of students that are underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>Understanding the processes governing the decomposition of dead wood is essential for forest management, especially to mitigate negative effects of declining dead wood stocks on forest productivity, biodiversity and carbon storage. Controls on decomposition of leaf litter are better resolved, with climate and litter quality considered predominant regulators of decomposition rates at global and regional scales. These factors also regulate decomposition of dead wood, but additional unidentified controls mean that wood decomposition rates at regional scales are hard to predict with reasonable certainty. The objective of this work is to identify important, additional controls, which can then be used to formulate and parameterize carbon cycle models, where wood decomposition is a critical uncertainty. In single site studies, the primary factor affecting wood decomposition rates appears to be fungal community structure. Indeed, the species, strain and interactions of wood-rot fungi are strong determinants of decay rates. In particular, those fungi that aggregate their hyphae into thick mycelial cords are considered dominant agents of decomposition. These hyphal-aggregating fungi are termed non-unit-restricted fungi because their mycelia proliferate and interconnect discrete pieces of wood. The connectivity confers a strong competitive advantage, allowing fungi to rapidly colonize dead wood by accessing a broad suite of nutrient sources. As such, the working hypothesis of our project is: The decomposition of downed dead wood proceeds rapidly when non-unit restricted wood-rot fungi can colonize efficiently. A primary control on colonization, and hence fungal-mediated decomposition rates, is the proximity and abundance of coarse woody material (CWM). The working hypothesis will be tested with observational transects and common-garden experiments across five sites spanning a regional climate gradient in eastern US temperate forests. Transect studies will assess the decomposition of logs of five tree species, across pronounced microclimate gradients, either next to or away from natural CWM. Four common gardens at each site will comprise zero, medium and high levels of CWM, crossed with replicates that use plastic edging to disrupt foraging by non-unit restricted fungi. Competing hypotheses to explain the observed patterns of decomposition will be evaluated using field and laboratory assays estimating abiotic factors and the functional abilities of the decomposer communities. The project will engage high school students through an internship program, where graduating students who have college offers to pursue STEM majors, and who are from backgrounds under-represented in higher education, will pursue a paid, summer research position. The goal is to help redress the low (10%) college matriculation rate of this group. The project will also involve training at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Lastly, public outreach to 6th graders will be developed in collaboration with the Peabody Museum of Natural History, to expand their educational toolkit for school-visit programs, and to promote public interest in fungi, CWM and decomposition."

The infected plant or animal is called a ""host"" and the infecting organism is called a ""pathogen"".  The interaction between hosts and pathogens is important to understand because it often determines one's health. Scientists are now becoming aware that the host-pathogen interaction is more complicated because one host can be infected by many pathogens, all of whom interact with each other as well as with the host.  Likewise, one type of pathogen can infect several types of hosts, and how one host responds can influence whether another host becomes infected.  Figuring out how all this plays out in Nature requires carefully designed experiments and mathematical models and this project provides both.  Developing a deeper understanding of hosts and pathogens is critical because humans are dramatically altering the biological world, introducing new types of hosts and pathogens in some areas and removing them from others. Understanding how such gains and losses of organisms influences the spread of disease is important to the fields of conservation science and public health. This research program will train undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in the fields of disease ecology and mathematical biology, and will engage the public through a variety of outreach activities. <br/><br/>Humans are impacting biodiversity patterns globally and these changes can influence the risk and prevalence of infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic multi-host multi-pathogen epidemiological theory that explains how between-host and between-pathogen competition jointly shape disease dynamics.  To determine how competition alters the amplification or dilution of diseases, mathematical models will be developed and tested using planktonic species and their associated pathogens via laboratory based mesocosm and field experiments. This work will both extend current theory on multi-host and multi-pathogen communities as well as unify theory developed independently for diseases with different transmission modes.  The theory-data pairing approach of this study is likely to generate important advances in epidemiological theory and disease ecology. This work will also yield insight into how future alterations to diversity will affect disease outbreaks in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goal is to understand how natural disturbances such as hurricanes impact plant biodiversity in tropical forests on the Island. Experiments and surveys before and after the hurricanes will be used to determine whether or not the hurricanes disrupted the process thought to be responsible for maintaining the incredible diversity of plant life there. Tropical rain forests are one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, and provide habitats for more than half of all plant and animal species, but we still do not fully understand how such immense diversity is maintained or how human and natural disturbances affect it. One well-known hypothesis predicts that species-specific natural enemies (disease-causing microbes) reduce the competitive ability of some trees, thereby allowing other trees to grow and survive, but detailed tests of this hypothesis are few. This project will test the hypothesis in various ways, by examining whether tree and soil microorganism distribution patterns are in sync with one another, and whether such interactions were altered by massive inputs and mixtures of leaf litter from recent hurricanes Irma and Maria.  The studies will take place through the auspices of the Luquillo Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site in El Yunque. The intellectual and technical capacity building for students and researchers in Puerto Rico and Oregon will directly benefit goals of improving the competitiveness of the United States in research, as well a broadening participation in science.<br/><br/>The Janzen-Connell hypothesis is one of the main hypotheses evoked to explain how tree diversity in tropical forests is maintained. To explicitly test the underlying assumption that trees have unique microbial signatures in the soils surrounding them, the DNA of fungi and bacteria will be sequenced from soils sampled at 0-10m within the bases of nine target trees before and after the hurricane in the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot, which has a gradient of human land use. To determine whether or not the strength of Janzen-Connell effects was altered, and how land use legacies interact with these processes, seedling transplant experiments will be conducted, and pathogens and mycorrhizal fungi will be isolated and used for further experiments. In combination with this team's extensive pre-hurricane data, the following hypotheses will be tested: H1: Sudden inputs of mixed leaf litter and debris from hurricane-force winds attenuate microbial signatures of canopy trees, which weakens Janzen-Connell effects due to diluted species-specific pathogen loads near canopy trees; H2: Mycorrhizal fungal colonization, richness, and diversity decrease following hurricane disturbance due to a lack of photosynthetic input from defoliated trees, making seedlings more vulnerable to generalized pathogen attack and nutrient limitation; H3: Recent human land use interacts with hurricane disturbance to further impede microbially-mediated coexistence processes.  Since human disturbance is pervasive in all tropical forests, and hurricane disturbance is increasing in intensity across a wide range of tropical areas from the Caribbean to the Asian tropics, results of this study will have generalizable implications for predicting tropical forest dynamics, and may provide insight into some of the unexplained variation observed in studies of forest recovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will help us understand the genetic, behavioral, and morphological changes that allowed new species to fully differentiate from one another. The research focuses on fruit flies, which have long served as a model organism for studies of genetics. The researchers will study three species of fruit flies that diverged from a common ancestor species only in the last 5,000-16,000 years.  By studying closely related species, it is possible to tease apart which genetic changes led to the original separation versus which changes happened afterwards. In particular, the project will identify what genetic differences are associated with differences in mating behavior and morphology that restrict or even prevent interbreeding between newly diverged species. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at two liberal arts colleges and train them in DNA sequencing and genetic analysis.  Further, the research findings will be used to train high school teachers and develop science educational workshops in upstate New York and western Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The researchers will test the hypothesis that chromosomal inversions have caused divergence and speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex by testing two key predictions: 1) Chromosomal inversions contain Quantitative Trait Loci for divergent male courtship song and female mating preferences that are responsible for sexual isolation between these taxa. 2) Chromosomal inversions show greater sequence divergence compared to genomic regions outside of the inversions. This study will directly test if chromosomal inversions harbor phenotypes that cause sexual isolation and thereby instigated reduction in gene flow between nascent species, thus facilitating the process of genomic divergence and speciation. Two datasets will be collected: inter-species crosses to genetically map behavioral speciation phenotypes and population genomic data covering the entire geographical range of each behavioral species."

Such interactions can influence the structure of ecological communities as well as the functioning of ecosystems.  For example, in ant-protection mutualisms, ants protect plants or herbivores in exchange for a nectar reward.  Ant mutualisms are hypothesized to have large effects on plant and herbivore species diversity and abundance. This project combines modeling and field work to explore the long-term consequences of a mutualism involving ant-protected herbivores. Understanding the feedbacks among plants, mutualistic herbivores and ants across multiple growing seasons will advance ecology by highlighting the potentially destabilizing effects of mutualisms on terrestrial ecosystems.  This project brings together two researchers at a primarily undergraduate institution with a strong record of undergraduate training and incorporation of underrepresented groups in science. The proposed work will employ honors undergraduate research as its primary vehicle for outreach and training, including integrative empirical and theoretical approaches. <br/><br/>By definition, the short-term effect of mutualism is to increase population densities. In herbivore-protection mutualisms, this increase in population density may lead to over-exploitation of host plants in the long-term with corresponding negative consequences for protected herbivores. Preliminary results show that herbivory by the ant-protected herbivore, Publilia concava, reduces the attractiveness of its perennial host-plant, tall goldenrod, to subsequent generations.  Using a two-way factorial design experiment (presence/absence of herbivores and presence/absence of ants) in two tall goldenrod field sites, this project will experimentally evaluate the consequences of the delayed herbivore effect on host-plants for host-plant selection and performance of Publilia concava. Repeated censuses of plants, herbivores, and ants over two years will document if herbivory mediates plant responses that influence herbivore performance and future host plant selection. These data will also be used to test a generalized spatial model of herbivore-protection mutualisms linking host choice behavior, induced plant resistance, and herbivore population dynamics.  Results from the proposal will increase understanding of the potentially destabilizing effects of mutualism and the effect of host-choice behavior by herbivores on herbivore-plant dynamics following delayed effects of herbivory."

Such chromosomal errors are the leading genetic cause of fetal loss, mental impairment, and developmental disability in humans. The number and location of recombination events varies within and among species for largely unknown reasons.

One important application of the comparative method in the study of biodiversity is the comparison of sister lineages, groups which are each other's closest relative, that have undergone very different evolutionary histories.  By comparing the fates of these lineages, scientists are able to understand why some are successful and others are not.  A prominent example is the sunflower family, the Asteraceae, and its less well-known sister family, the Calyceraceae. The Asteraceae has been one of the most successful plant families with over 20,000 species spread throughout the world, including many economically important plants, such as sunflowers, daises, lettuce, artichokes and dandelions. The evolution of the Calyceraceae on the other hand has resulted in only 56 species, all found in southern South America. Despite the large number of species, Asteraceae researchers are developing an understanding of the family?s evolutionary trajectory and traits, however little is known about the Calyceraceae. This research project will develop an understanding of what the common ancestor of these two families was like. This will allow a careful analysis of which changes allowed the Asteraceae to succeed in generating great diversity, including developing economically important traits, and which inhibited Calyceraceae diversification. This project will foster interactions among scientists, graduate, and undergraduate students in two countries, thus enhancing international collaboration and cultural awareness. <br/><br/>Field work will be undertaken in collaboration with researchers in Argentina to collect the 56 species of the Calyceraceae. This material will be used to generate a molecular phylogeny and a morphological trait matrix.  Comparative DNA sequencing of both chloroplast and nuclear genes will be undertaken to infer phylogenetic relationships in the family. Additionally a morphological trait matrix, of important flower and fruit characteristics, will be generated and analyzed in conjunction with the phylogeny to study the evolution of character states in the Calyceraceae.  This data on the Calyceraceae will complement the knowledge already available for the Asteraceae allowing for addressing powerful comparative biology questions.  What are the phylogenetic relationships among all species of Calyceraceae? What are the ancestral floral and fruit character traits states in Calyceraceae and how do these relate to those in the Asteraceae?  The final products of the research include bilingual taxonomic revision, including dichotomous and polyclave keys, which will be made available in both print and electronic versions. To increase participation by underrepresented groups, students will be recruited via Brigham Young University's Multicultural Student Center. Guest presentations and lab exercises covering state-core competencies will be developed with two area high school instructors. A rotating display will also be developed, using age-appropriate materials, for the BYU Life Science Museum, which is heavily visited by K-12 students."

Despite the many different eye types possessed by animals from jellyfish to humans, the genes affecting how light is transformed into the chemical signals of seeing are similar across eyes.  Interestingly, some of these genes necessary for light-sensing in eyes are also found in organs not used for vision. Therefore, it may be that the light-sensing machinery used in eyes came from a non-eye origin. This project looks at how genes can be turned on and off in a new place in the body or at different times during development to generate eyes. In doing so it will help us more generally to understand how organisms can evolve to repurpose their genes to create entirely new organs. The work will produce new genome sequences that can be used by commercial and governmental agencies in aquaculture development for economically important species, like scallops, oysters, and clams.  It will also improve 7-12th grade educators' understanding of evolution to help them achieve the Next Generation Science Standards goals. This will be done by training them to better teach molecular evolution, and creating and disseminating novel lesson plans for teaching molecular evolution to high school students. The research will also provide training opportunities in cutting edge fields of genomics and bioinformatics to postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate students. This will increase the skills of the next generation of workers in using DNA-based tools and analyses. <br/> <br/>Understanding the evolutionary origin of eyes is of great interest to biologists because eyes provide insight into how complex phenotypes can arise through redeployment and elaboration of genetic pathways. Yet, previous studies have not utilized closely related taxa that possess a diversity of eye types. This work will examine five separate origins of eyes in a group of closely related bivalves in the Pteriomorphia. Using a combination of tissue-specific transcriptomes and genome assembly, the researchers will identify genes involved in phototransduction across species spanning the taxonomic and ocular diversity of the Pteriomorphia and analyze these in a phylogenetic framework to understand how changes to either the location or timing of gene expression has played a role in the evolution of pteriomorphian eye type diversity. The work will address the following questions: 1) Are lineages with eyes associated with gene family expansions of the phototransduction pathway members? 2) What is the degree of similarity of the phototransduction genes between the different photoreceptive structures within and among species? and 3) Do eyes acquire their phototransduction pathways using the same evolutionary process or does each eye have a unique evolutionary trajectory to photoreception? This work is the first phylogenetic investigation of eye evolution in bivalves, and builds on the PIs' research, recently available genomic resources, and new data on phototransduction pathway evolution. The project will thus advance knowledge of how sensory systems evolve.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comparing forests in different parts of the earth will help us understand if the response is uniform or regionally specific.  This project compares forest responses in the temperate deciduous forest in the eastern United States and in eastern China. These two countries have opposite histories and trajectories of air pollution. When the Industrial Revolution began, air pollution in the form of acid deposition increased rapidly in the U.S. and was at high levels until the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 when the pollution dropped dramatically. Over the same time period, China has had low levels of air pollution until relatively recently as pollution levels have increased to historic highs. In a preliminary study using tree rings and carbon isotopes, an important isotopic signal was found in Eastern red cedars in the West Virginia that indicated these trees are now recovering from air pollution. This observation, however, is limited to a single species from a single stand of trees.  This project will determine how wide-spread and universal this response is by using additional tree species along a transect stretching across the southern, central, and northern Appalachian region. Similar transects in China will be used to compare the isotopic signatures and growth of trees from similar genera that are currently undergoing opposite patterns of change in acid deposition.  <br/><br/>If widespread, results from this study will have important implications for carbon storage and cycling in many northern hemisphere forests, especially those downwind from pollution sources.

Hawaii has the highest prevalence of this lung disease in the United States. While NTM are regarded as an environmentally acquired type of bacteria, there is much we don't understand about where they live in the environment, which of those places are most important for getting into people and causing disease, and how interactions with the host cause disease. This interdisciplinary project will study NTM found from a broad range of environments, such as household water sources, soils, feral pigs, and healthy humans, and compare these to strains from patients in Hawaii. This will be the first time soil and water characteristics, climatic factors, human genes and behaviors, bacterial genomics, and potential vertebrate reservoirs are studied together in a single model. The work will help us understand how bacteria that are sometimes free living and sometimes associated with people and animals use their environment, and provide needed information about environmentally acquired NTM lung disease, and how to reduce these types of infections. This research will involve a large-scale citizen science project. It will involve patients in research, establish outreach programs, and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows from Hawaii and other underrepresented Pacific Islands in the fields of microbiology, microbial genomics and ecology, and mathematical modeling.

Human susceptibility to NTM infections will be examined by sequencing the genomes of individuals with NTM lung disease, to investigate and identify human genetic factors influencing disease incidence, including the examination of immune genes, cilia function genes, and genes affecting body or organ morphology. Over 3,000 environmental samples from Hawaii will be examined, and whole genome sequencing of over 1,000 environmental and clinical NTM bacterial strains will be conducted to comprehensively characterize the genome evolution and population dynamics of clinically relevant NTM species on the Hawaiian islands. These data will be combined with environmental analysis of water and soil characteristics to identify variables contributing to NTM survival and colonization in the environment. Through modeling of where individuals acquire NTM infections the research will contribute to identifying specific environmental, climatological, animal reservoirs, host genetic anomalies and behaviors, and particular genetic subtypes that facilitate this acquisition, driving the high prevalence of NTM lung disease in Hawaii.

Lacking long term data, an alternative approach is to examine shorter-term change in species interactions in response to rapid climate shifts, and combine that information with a detailed understanding of long-term climatic trends. This project extends a detailed study of pollinator abundance and species diversity (primarily bumblebees) with plant flowering patterns in coastal, central California.  This region had been experiencing an increasingly severe drought, and average temperatures that have been increasing for decades.  The current warm, wet El Nino event presents a unique opportunity to assess the responses and resilience of this system of pollinators and plant species.  A diverse and abundant assemblage of pollinator species is critical to the maintenance of native plant species in this region.  This study will inform the management of nature reserves and will also provide important information on how pollinators, which are essential to US agriculture, respond to climate change. The project will help broaden participation in science through graduate student training, and through a workshop to engage land managers of relevant habitats.<br/><br/>The work addresses three specific, testable hypotheses: (1) plant flowering and pollinator activity will be temporally disconnected in the wet El Nino year; (2) bumblebees respond immediately to the resource boom provided by heavy, extended flowering in the El Nino, but solitary bee responses will be delayed a year; and (3) pollinator networks will be more specialized in the wet El Nino year than during the drought, because bees will select more preferred plant species when flowers are abundant.  The potential temporal mismatch is an important ecological problem in the context of changing climatic variability."

Individuals vary widely in how many mates they acquire, and as a result, how many offspring they produce. Understanding why such variation exists and how it is linked to traits of he organisms is essential for understanding variation between the sexes, populations, and species. Surprisingly, scientists are often unable to predict the conditions under which strong variation in mate acquisition will exist and which traits improve mate acquisition. This research will theoretically and empirically identify a range of understudied ecological factors that influence mate acquisition, thereby transforming our understanding of how animals successfully reproduce.

To accomplish these goals, the PI will use an integrative approach that employs empirical and theoretical tools to 1) assess the effects of resource availability, chance, life history, and more well studied factors on mating dynamics and 2) empirically explore the relationship between such factors and phenotypic traits that increase mating success in a range of fish species. Students will be involved in all aspects of the research and the PI will lead K-12 outreach activities.

However, modern crocodylians are more diverse than often appreciated and their skulls, in particular, can range from short and wide to incredibly long and slender. Prior research has shown that crocodylian skull shape is correlated with dietary and habitat specializations, but it remains unclear how these shapes come to be. The formation of crocodylian skull diversity is tied to development: the changes that occur in an individual as it grows from a fertilized egg to an adult. The process of development is controlled by genes, and changes to how genes are expressed can modify developmental pathways and adult anatomy. By combining data from fossils, crocodylian embryos, and modern developmental biology techniques, this project will reveal which changes in developmental pathways were key to the evolution of the crocodylian skull, and the evolutionary diversity of crocodylians. Insights from this research may also inform general connections between genomic, developmental and organismal complexity in vertebrates. To capitalize on the public interest in crocodiles and their relatives (dinosaurs and birds), this project will develop K-12 activities for students and teachers in conjunction with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). These activities explore key concepts in paleontology and developmental biology and will be tied to the Next Generation Science Standards. The HMNH provides a unique venue to reach a diverse urban audience from across the Boston Metropolitan area and visitors from around the world.<br/><br/> Unique morphological features distinguish major groups of animals like crocodylians, mammals, and birds. These features are important for the particular lifestyles and habits of these groups and have been critical for their survival over millions of years. The formation of this diversity is caused by the evolution of novel genes, novel functions for genes, or modification to the developmental pattern of gene expression. Integrating fossils, embryos, and developmental genetic techniques, this study will reveal developmental mechanisms involved in the evolution of crocodylian cranial diversity. This project will study the expression patterns of key genes involved in the development of the skull in extant crocodylians using in situ hybridization. Developmental stages from eight target species, which broadly sample the phylogeny and diversity of snout shapes in modern crocodylians, will be analyzed. The project aims to experimentally replicate ancestral and derived gene expression patterns and to use geometric morphometrics to quantify the relationship between expression patterns and skull shapes. These functional studies in alligator embryos will test the likelihood that particular changes in development were the cause of evolutionary changes in anatomy. This project integrates paleontology, anatomy, and developmental biology to link changes in anatomy to genetic inheritance through development. This integrative methodology will lead to a greater understanding of critical mechanisms underlying the evolution of anatomical diversity and novel features of organisms."

The grasses from which the prairie takes its name are close relatives of those that make up the vast grasslands of eastern Africa.   The grasses provide food for livestock and wild animals, and habitat for birds; they also pull carbon from the atmosphere and bury it deep in the ground where it supports beneficial microbes that make the rich soil on which American agriculture depends.  This project is a collaboration between research scientists at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri, undergraduates at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois, and colleagues in eastern Africa, and is aimed at unraveling the ways the grasses spread their pollen, how they provide their seeds with carbon, and how the seeds are dispersed across the landscape.  This information will tell us how the grasslands will respond in the face of current disturbance such as fire, urbanization, and conversion to farmland, and future disturbances caused by a changing climate.  <br/> <br/><br/>This project focuses on three major grass genera, Andropogon, Schizachyrium, and Hyparrhenia, plus a few smaller related genera, that together include some 250 species many of which are ecological dominants.  Researchers will first use DNA sequences to uncover the phylogenetic history of the group, and then use that history to trace how the seed-bearing portions of the plant have changed over evolutionary time and how they correlate with climate, fire, and moisture.  The seeds in these plants do not simply drop off the plant.  Instead they are released as part of a complex dispersal structure that includes pieces of floral stalks and leaf-like bracts. The dispersal structure varies between species in size, presence or absence of hairs, presence of male and female flowers, and presence or absence of awns (hygroscopic extensions of bracts).  The structure may be an adaptation for seed dispersal, for the control of germination in particular soil types, or for resistance to fire.  However, the same structures may also help with pollination.  In addition, many parts of the dispersal structure are green during development, and may provide photosynthate for the developing seed.  Thus the structure could be selected for functions at three different life history stages: pollination, grain filling, and dispersal.  This project will use both a historical phylogenetic approach and an experimental approach to test the current function of the dispersal structure.   The dispersal structure studied here is much like that of sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus, so the data will apply to those crops as well as to the major grassland species."

Many older groups of fishes were going extinct and being replaced by modern groups. But where did the modern groups come from, and how and why did they replace the older groups? These questions, among others, are unanswered because the fossil record of fishes from this time period is extremely poor. This project analyzes newly discovered, complete fossilized skeletons of freshwater fish from a critical time period (72-66 million years ago). These fossils are extraordinarily well-preserved, providing a rare glimpse of complete skeletons. This project will fill a critical gap in understanding the origin and evolution of modern freshwater fish. In addition to the scientific merit of this project, there are several broader impacts. First, the fossils to be described are deposited in publicly accessible natural history collections, thereby ensuring that they are available in perpetuity to the scientific community. Second, student training programs developed around the preparation and analysis of the fossils provides valuable research and training for budding scientists. Third, results from this study will be published in scientific articles and presented at professional meetings and seminars for public audiences. And finally, by using the resources available at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the project will increase public understanding of science. All specimens will be prepared in a lab where active preparation and study of the specimens can be observed by the more than 1.2 million annual visitors to the Field Museum, including many K-12 student groups and teachers, and a temporary exhibit of this exquisitely preserved fossil fish fauna will add an important component to current exhibits at the Field Museum. <br/><br/>Although the modern freshwater fish fauna of North America has been intensively studied, its origin, biogeography, and evolutionary history are still poorly understood, due in part to a lack of whole-body fossils from Cretaceous freshwater deposits, particularly those containing articulated skeletons. This study uses exceptionally well-preserved fossil fish from a recently discovered lagerstatten in the Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of North Dakota, to illuminate the transition between the early Mesozoic (consisting of extinct orders and families) and the modern freshwater fauna. Recently discovered blocks containing the articulated, complete skeletons of many freshwater fish have been acquired by the Field Museum for preparation and analysis. All fossils will be described and illustrated using a combination of detailed photographic documentation of all aspects of the anatomy of the species with matched line drawings clearly showing the interpretation of the morphology. These data will form the basis of original morphological descriptions, character conceptualization, and phylogenetic and comparative analyses of key fish lineages present in the blocks, including the Acipenseridae, Polyodontidae, Amiidae, Lepisosteidae, and possibly Teleostei.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet as agents of strong selection on plant populations, they are also valuable for understanding basic evolutionary processes, such as discovering the genes involved in adaptation. Furthermore, studying plant evolution in the context of drought may produce the critical knowledge needed to develop drought tolerant crops. Using a global map of historic drought frequency based on remote sensing data, populations were identified that experience very different drought frequencies. From data on genetic differences among those populations, 20 genes were identified that will be studied for their molecular and phenotypic effects. This work is expected to yield key insight into the evolution of gene function, and to confirm genes underlying drought tolerance traits. The results of studying these genes may be of great value to breeding programs working to improve drought tolerance in crop species. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.  <br/><br/>Historic drought frequency significantly predicts important drought tolerance traits, flowering time and water use efficiency, among natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. The project will investigate the effects of loss of function alleles on 20 genes involved in flowering time or water use efficiency. A reverse genetics approach based on T-DNA gene knockouts will be used to artificially induce mutations in these genes in a common genomic background. The project will quantify the effect sizes of these hypothesized genes on flowering time and water use efficiency.

While much research has focused on understanding species ranges at their expanding, leading-edges where they are becoming more abundant, less emphasis has been placed on understanding why populations would be declining at their lower latitude, trailing-edges. This project focuses on bird species found at their trailing-edges in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and examines how a variety of factors may contribute to their decline in numbers at this edge of their range. Specifically, this research will test the relative importance of: species tolerance to extreme temperatures and drought, competition with other species, mismatches between the availability of food sources and nesting times, and factors associated with having small population sizes and limited movement patterns. The results of this study will be important in efforts to conserve and manage species given changing environmental conditions and expected changes in the distributions of species. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate students in the development of different ecological modeling approaches, will develop a citizen sciences program, and will expose underserved high school STEM students to field ecology.  <br/> <br/>Theoretical work predicts that changing environmental conditions can interact with ecological processes to cause range shifts. Empirical studies have, however, failed to identify the relative contributions of species tolerances and mechanisms such as competition, phenological mismatches, density-dependence, and dispersal limitations in explaining these distributional shifts. This study uses experimental and observational data to determine the relative role physiological tolerances and other mechanisms play in explaining the population dynamics of several bird species found at their low-latitude range limits in the southern Appalachian Mountains. This study will overcome the limitations of species distribution models for understanding range shifts by developing novel spatio-temporal point process models that can be fitted to empirical data. This framework is unique in its ability to describe and predict ecological processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales while accounting for individual variation in demographic rates. This research will advance scientific understanding of range shifts, will produce a new framework for integrating theoretical and applied ecology, and will develop predictive models to inform the conservation of biodiversity."

If their evolved genetic differences are not great, the two species may mate and produce hybrid offspring. Between-species crossbreeding, once considered a rare and mostly inconsequential phenomenon, has now been documented in a wide variety of species pairs including brown/polar bears, dog/wolf, cow/bison, and even human/Neanderthal. Importantly, in each of these cases, at least some of the hybrid offspring were viable and fertile as evidenced by tracking genetic exchanges between these species pairs. Each of these past crossbreeding events can be considered a natural experiment across what were thought to be species barriers. This project will develop tools for detecting and analyzing genes that have moved across species. Application of the tool will focus on two species pairs for which past hybridization has been particularly important. Cows and bison were intentionally crossbred by ranchers in the early 1900s, such that most bison carry cow genes. Brown bears and polar bears had several episodes of past crossbreeding,and this continues to occur. Analysis of these species pairs will reveal which genes are refractory to movement across species and which are not. This information will be key to understanding the extent and consequences of future hybridization of any species pair of interest. Outreach to the public, students, and pre-service teachers will occur through a focus on the California Golden Bear and associated educational programs at the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/>The new flexible ancestry inference tool will be capable of localizing introgressed genomic regions even when only low-coverage DNA sequence data are available.

The application of this tool to two species pairs with known admixture histories will provide new insights into the processes of speciation and local adaptation, with the potential to inform management practices that seek to limit admixed ancestry in populations that are targeted for conservation.

The environmental cues or genes that initiate this male/female-determination differ across species, and they can even be variable within a species. It is not well understood how ecological factors contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in male/female-determination within species. To address this shortcoming, this research uses the house fly as a model system because this species has substantial variation in how the male/female decision is made. Notably, there are two common ways that male development can be initiated, and they differ in their geographical distributions. One male-determining variant predominates at northern latitudes, and the other is more common in the south. The researchers are investigating if the two different variants are both maintained because they are beneficial at different temperatures. In addition, female development can be initiated independently from the male-determining variants in house fly. The researchers are also investigating if the variants that initiate male development have deleterious effects in females. These antagonistic effects could further explain why variation in male/female-determination is maintained in house fly populations. Undergraduate students training to be high school teachers will contribute to this research. Those students will work with the researchers to provide continuing education training to current teachers. They will also lead middle and high school classrooms in exercises that use house flies to illustrate core concepts in genetics and evolution. These activities will impact students from under-served communities that are under-represented in the sciences.<br/><br/>To determine how natural selection can maintain variation in male/female-determination, the researchers are combining laboratory experiments, surveys of natural populations, and genomic techniques. Specifically, the research tests the hypothesis that male/female-specific genotype-by-environment interactions affect selection pressures acting on Y chromosomes to maintain variation in male/female-determination in house fly. The environment-dependent phenotypic effects of very young Y chromosomes will be assessed using laboratory experiments and high throughput gene expression profiling. Predictions about allele frequencies in laboratory populations and over seasons in the wild will be tested, and fitness effects will be modeled. The hypothesis that suppressed recombination maintains linkage between male-determining genes and other genetic variation with male/female-antagonistic or environment-specific effects will be evaluated using recombination mapping, genome sequencing, and population genetic data to test for X-Y differentiation. This research connects ecologically relevant selection pressures and male-female conflict with the evolution of an essential developmental pathway, joining population genetics and the evolution of development in a single framework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And following on that: What environmental factors determine where a particular species occurs?  Despite the seeming simplicity of these questions, they remain unanswered for the vast majority of species. This lack of knowledge is especially troubling given the implications for understanding how species will respond to climate change through either shifts in where they occur or through physiological adaptations.  This study will address these and other questions through a series of experimental and observational studies conducted in the Andean mountains of Peru, where many species are unusually vulnerable to small changes in temperature and rainfall.  More specifically, the project will measure altitudinal ranges and thermal tolerances of nearly two dozen cloud forest tree species. The investigators will also determine the extent to which small populations of each species are tightly adapted to particular elevations (""local adaptation"") and each species' ability to change its thermal tolerance (""plasticity""). Data will be incorporated into models designed to predict where species currently occur and where they might start to occur as climates change. <br/> <br/>This project is one of the first to systematically test several key assumptions critical to the assessment how climate change will impact where species are able to live. It will be the first-ever study to simultaneously measure the thermal tolerances of individuals, populations, and species of tropical trees. The results will greatly expand our understanding of the complex factors determining where species occur, and will strengthen our ability to predict species responses to future climate change.<br/><br/>The research will be integrated with an extensive set of educational, training, and outreach programs in collaboration with established domestic and international environmental education organizations. Outreach programs are designed to help increase the participation of US minorities and international students in the biological sciences, and to broaden public awareness of the potential impacts of climate change on tropical forests around the world."

The long-term stability of coastal wetlands is explained by interactions between sea level, plant growth, sediment supply, and wetland accretion, but coastal wetland stability is threatened by changes in environmental conditions. Sediment supply has been implicated as the ultimate control on potential vertical accretion rates in many tidal wetlands and, hence, their ability to keep pace with sea level. Human activities in watersheds have significantly altered the delivery of sediment from watersheds to the coast, and indeed there is evidence of past expansion of tidal wetlands in response to increased sediment supply. However, more recent land use change, reforestation, and dam construction have reduced sediment delivery from many watersheds to the coast. The goal of this project is to understand how past and current land use in watersheds that drain to the East Coast of the United States has altered sediment concentrations in rivers, to determine how changes in sediment supply influences sediment accumulation rates in coastal wetlands, and to project future wetland vulnerability along the East Coast under various scenarios of sea level rise and sediment supply. This information is critically needed, and will be of use to researchers, managers, and stakeholders. This collaborative project includes a strong commitment to integrate research and undergraduate education and increase diversity in the sciences. The lead institution on this project serves primarily undergraduate students, and undergraduate student summer interns and academic year thesis research students will be involved in all aspects of the project. <br/><br/>This project takes the novel approach of documenting temporally-variable wetland accretion rates over the past century to evaluate changing watershed-derived sediment supply in nine estuaries along the East Coast of the United States. Land use change over the same time period will be examined in these watersheds to determine the major drivers of changing sediment supply. The investigators will test the following hypotheses: H1. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) have decreased in many (but not all) rivers draining to the East Coast in recent decades due to increased population densities, shifts away from agricultural land-use, and dam construction in watersheds, H2. Recent declines in fluvial SSC are reflected in lower wetland mineral accretion rates in many coastal estuarine wetlands. Geographic patterns of recent accretion rates reflect regional patterns of sediment decline, with the greatest reductions in mid-Atlantic wetlands, H3. Sediment deposition and marsh accretion will be greater in the plots with higher SSC availability and with plant trapping of SSCs. Further, due to complex ecogeomorphic feedbacks between marsh elevation, sediment deposition, and plant production, plant productivity will respond to SSC availability, and H4. Coastal wetland vulnerability to current sea level rise follows a regional pattern that reflects both the rate of relative sea level rise (highest in mid-Atlantic) and SSC (lowest in Northeast and Southeast). However, changing SSC and mineral accretion rates (greatest declines in mid-Atlantic) will alter future regional patterns of vulnerability to sea level rise.  The researchers will use innovative experiments to manipulate suspended sediment concentrations in water flooding a marsh over several years in a sediment-poor marsh system to directly evaluate rates of sediment deposition, plant growth, and marsh elevation, yielding empirical evidence for the role of sediment availability on ecogeomorphic feedback processes in marshes. These data will be used to validate, parameterize, and expand an existing model (the Marsh Equilibrium Model). The model will then be used to hindcast marsh accretion rates and to forecast marsh stability under various future scenarios of sediment availability and rates of relative sea level rise. The land use change and fluvial sediment supply analyses will be coupled with measurements of temporally-variable marsh accretion rates and modeling to provide a comprehensive examination of estuarine wetland vulnerability to sea level rise.

It is profoundly important, therefore, to understand urban ecosystems. Cities are consumers of energy and resources and producers of waste. They are also social networks that create innovation, efficiency, and solutions. The Central Arizona-Phoenix LTER Program (CAP) empowers researchers from the environmental and social sciences to study cities as social-ecological systems. The scientific goals of the CAP research are: 1) to use long-term data to articulate and answer new questions about cities that require a long-term perspective; 2) to develop and use future scenarios to help answer research questions; 3) to apply and create new knowledge about urban ecosystems; and 4) to build broad partnerships to make cities more resilient and sustainable places to live. In addition, Ecology Explorers, CAP's premier education program, will connect teachers and pre-college students with CAP scientists. CAP is also involving Phoenix residents in scientific research by working with community partners and municipal agencies. Finally, CAP's rich database is a valuable and growing resource for scientists, students, teachers and decision makers.<br/><br/>Understanding urban ecosystems remains central to the CAP enterprise. The central question articulates the interconnectedness of human motivations, behaviors, actions, and outcomes with urban ecosystem structure and function: How do the ecosystem services provided by urban ecological infrastructure (UEI) affect human outcomes and behavior, and how do human actions affect patterns of urban ecosystem structure and function and, ultimately, urban sustainability and resilience? A new theoretical focus for CAP is on Urban Ecological Infrastructure (UEI) as a critical bridge between the system's biophysical and human/social domains. UEI is thus central in the conceptual framework that guides all CAP activities. CAP researchers explore new social-ecological frontiers of interdisciplinary urban ecology in residential landscapes, urban waterbodies, desert parks and preserves, the flora, fauna, and climate of a 'riparianized' desert city, and urban design and governance. CAP research is organized around eight interdisciplinary questions and researchers are organized into eight Interdisciplinary Research Teams to address these questions. CAP now includes research on broader societal impacts, with a theoretical focus on the nexus of ecology and design to enhance urban sustainability and resilience. This focus, combined with ongoing CAP scenarios work, is the translational link between social-ecological research outcomes and city institutions, ultimately making Phoenix, and cities in general, better places to live.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Working with partners in state and Federal agencies, the investigators will determine how the spread of disease is affected by management actions such as hunting and relocation of animals; how future disease outbreaks might spread through vulnerable populations; and how they might be controlled via vaccination, development of quarantine buffer zones, or other means. The project also includes outreach efforts to educate the public about conservation issues, and engage students in relevant studies in disease ecology. This project will involve students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>The study will evaluate how the interaction between landscape structure and management interventions affect disease spread in populations of wide-ranging apex predators (Puma concolor). Using an exceptional database and corresponding set of biological samples, and an experienced collaborative team, the research will trace the spread of two apathogenic (i.e. non-pathogenic), contact-dependent retroviral agents in geographically distinct puma populations under three different management regimes: (a) supplementation and recovery of the highly endangered Florida panther, (b) large-scale manipulative harvest experiments of a rural Colorado puma population, and (c) steady-state management of urban puma populations in the Colorado Front Range and Southern California. A landscape genomics approach will inform advanced network models to determine the relative importance of landscape structure and management actions on host connectivity, demography, and, ultimately, disease dynamics. These apathogenic transmission models will be tested with empirical data from a recent virulent outbreak of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) in Florida Panthers. The model will be used to predict disease spread of virulent agents using models based on apathogenic agents, and to inform management programs to control disease outbreaks. This integrated approach provides a basis for utilizing complex molecular and geospatial tools to advance models to predict and mitigate virulent disease outbreaks for wide-ranging species in complex landscapes."

This collaborative project includes a strong commitment to integrate research and undergraduate education and increase diversity in the sciences. The lead institution on this project serves primarily undergraduate students, and undergraduate student summer interns and academic year thesis research students will be involved in all aspects of the project. <br/><br/>This project takes the novel approach of documenting temporally-variable wetland accretion rates over the past century to evaluate changing watershed-derived sediment supply in nine estuaries along the East Coast of the United States. Land use change over the same time period will be examined in these watersheds to determine the major drivers of changing sediment supply. The investigators will test the following hypotheses: H1. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) have decreased in many (but not all) rivers draining to the East Coast in recent decades due to increased population densities, shifts away from agricultural land-use, and dam construction in watersheds, H2. Recent declines in fluvial SSC are reflected in lower wetland mineral accretion rates in many coastal estuarine wetlands. Geographic patterns of recent accretion rates reflect regional patterns of sediment decline, with the greatest reductions in mid-Atlantic wetlands, H3. Sediment deposition and marsh accretion will be greater in the plots with higher SSC availability and with plant trapping of SSCs. Further, due to complex ecogeomorphic feedbacks between marsh elevation, sediment deposition, and plant production, plant productivity will respond to SSC availability, and H4. Coastal wetland vulnerability to current sea level rise follows a regional pattern that reflects both the rate of relative sea level rise (highest in mid-Atlantic) and SSC (lowest in Northeast and Southeast). However, changing SSC and mineral accretion rates (greatest declines in mid-Atlantic) will alter future regional patterns of vulnerability to sea level rise.  The researchers will use innovative experiments to manipulate suspended sediment concentrations in water flooding a marsh over several years in a sediment-poor marsh system to directly evaluate rates of sediment deposition, plant growth, and marsh elevation, yielding empirical evidence for the role of sediment availability on ecogeomorphic feedback processes in marshes. These data will be used to validate, parameterize, and expand an existing model (the Marsh Equilibrium Model). The model will then be used to hindcast marsh accretion rates and to forecast marsh stability under various future scenarios of sediment availability and rates of relative sea level rise. The land use change and fluvial sediment supply analyses will be coupled with measurements of temporally-variable marsh accretion rates and modeling to provide a comprehensive examination of estuarine wetland vulnerability to sea level rise. This research will provide integrated assessment of estuarine marsh response to both sea level rise and sediment availability."

One important criterion for classifying two organisms as separate species is their inability to interbreed. However, little is known about the particular genes that prevent different species from forming viable offspring. The goal of this research is to identify the genes that cause hybrid sterility between two closely related species of the model plant Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a genus of wildflowers native to western North America. With innovative crossing designs and field experiments, this work will determine which genes maintain species, as well as characterize the molecular functions and evolutionary dynamics of these genes in nature. <br/><br/>This project represents a significant contribution toward understanding the molecular, genetic, and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie the origin of species. This research will generate valuable plant collections and genome sequence data that will add to the general utility of the Mimulus model system. In addition, this proposal details a plan for engaging a broad audience in evolutionary genetics research, including local high school teachers who will develop hands-on Mimulus lab activities for use in their own classrooms. The proposal also includes a plan to reform undergraduate biology education by integrating research into the learning experiences of a diverse student population. In collaboration with a team of education specialists, the principal investigator will develop a Mimulus undergraduate research project for use in the University of Georgia's large enrollment introductory biology course series with the long-term goal of improving student learning and retention in the sciences."

Damage to urban forests was widespread. Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A powerful way to address this question is through artificial selection experiments. This project will explore the evolution of complex traits by summarizing and synthesizing more than two decades of research involving replicate lines of mice that were bred for high levels of voluntary exercise. The project will result in two main products, a book and a web resource with a searchable data base of topics, available data, and available tissue samples. This combination of products will ensure this knowledge base is accessible to the general public, as well as to scientists. The book, web page, and data will be valuable resources for the research community by expanding scientific knowledge in the general areas of evolutionary genetics and organismal biology. Synthesis of this long-term research will also contribute to our general understanding of the biological control of levels of physical activity, and so may have important implications for human health and well-being, as well as animal welfare. Additional broader impacts include the training of graduate students, who will participate in the synthetic activities. Short videos targeting the public will also be created for an existing YouTube channel.<br/><br/>Data will be synthesized from research involving more than 80 generations of selective breeding in four replicate High Runner lines of mice, and four non-selected control lines. This long-term data set provides unique opportunities for integrative study of evolution across multiple levels of biological organization in ways that are not possible with simpler organisms, such as bacteria. These unique lines of mice constitute the best-characterized vertebrate selection experiment in history, but the overall body of knowledge has never been synthesized and presented in an accessible format. Examples of topics to be addressed in the synthetic activities include: adaptation, artificial selection, behavior evolves first hypothesis, coadaptation, constraints, costs, emergent properties, epistasis, genes of major effect, genetic architecture, genetic assimilation, genetic drift, genotype-phenotype map, hybrid vigor, inbreeding depression, life history evolution and aging, maintenance of genetic variation, multiple solutions, plasticity, pleiotropy, population differentiation, predictability of evolution, quantitative genetics, quantitative trait loci, trade-offs, unintentional selection, and variation at the individual level.

Such data have great power to reveal the boundaries separating species. However, with increased amounts of sequence data, the genetic differences that are detected are not just associated with species boundaries, but include genetic differences among populations within species. As a consequence, species boundaries are misidentified, which has profound implications across biology because species are the basic unit of reference for framing biological questions. This project data will develop analytical methods to avoid conflating the boundaries of species with the local population structure within them. It will use computer simulations to evaluate key data properties affecting the accuracy of species detection, as well as the performance of the new method, especially when different processes give rise to the formation of new species. These simulations will be informed by examples from nature, assuring that biological realities, not just theoretical ideals, are jointly considered. A diverse team of researchers with complementary skill sets will advance both the scientific goals and outreach activities, which range from developing educational instruments for the public and policy makers to the training of students involved in biodiversity research. <br/><br/>Current genetic-based species delimitation methods can potentially lead to mass overestimates of biodiversity by treating population and species divergence as statistically equivalent. The proposed research will address these limitations. Under the new modeling approach for species delimitation, for the first time speciation is modeled as an extended process, as opposed to being treated as an instantaneous event, and as such, this approach can be used to gain insights about the diversification process itself as well. Specifically, the new approach will couple the multispecies coalescent with different diversification models for Bayesian statistical inference to avoid conflating population and species distinctiveness. The approach will be disseminated in a free software package DELIMIT and developed with reference to existing empirical data, specifically, genomic datasets of Australian squamates. Many of these genera show extraordinarily deep phylogeographic structure across thousands of loci within currently recognized species, suggesting substantial underestimation of species diversity, whereas other genera represent recent adaptive radiations, such that the empirical systems span a range of speciation processes. This context will be used to assess how robust inferred species boundaries are to different diversification processes, but also validate inferences from DELIMIT regarding the speciation process itself by testing for a general correspondence with non-genetic information about the speciation process."

This question is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, but has been very difficult to answer. A major problem is that current analytical approaches, known as phylogenetic comparative methods, require that a single value be used to represent a trait for an entire species. As a result, valuable information on differences among individuals within a species can't be used. This limits the types of questions that these comparative methods can address. The main goal of this project is to develop new analytical software that accounts for trait variation within species, which will result in a much more powerful computational tool. The newly developed software will be tested using experimental data from salamanders and fish. This award will have multiple broader impacts. This new tool will let a whole new set of hypotheses be tested and will be widely used by scientists doing evolutionary ecology research. Undergraduate students will receive hands-on training in mathematical modeling and software development. Educational outreach activities include a research-education exchange between a regional undergraduate university and a large research university. National and international teaching workshops will help train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.<br/><br/>Analyses of phenotypic data tend to remain distinctly different enterprises between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. Consequently, we still do not know how microevolutionary trends from ecological selection associate to macroevolutionary trends across phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) measure the amount of phylogenetic signal in a set of data or account for the phylogenetic relatedness among observations when evaluating ecological variation, but currently work only with single values for species. Thus, large amounts of within-species data are disregarded when using PCMs, which limits their inferential capability. This project will develop an analytical solution to this problem, and provide a framework for extending PCMs to large data sets comprising microevolutionary data. The methods developed will allow scientists to evaluate the consistency of small-scale and large scale evolutionary relationships in a comparative framework. This project will incorporate both theoretical and empirical components.  Statistical research will evaluate the statistical power and inferential error rates of ""expanded-PCM"" to varied analytical designs, phenotypic variables, tree topologies, and data balance. These methods will be applied empirically to two vertebrate systems to study the phylogenetic relatedness of intra-species morphological variation, as it is associated with intra- and interspecific ecological variation. Several educational outreach activities will also be conducted, including: a research-in-education exchange between a primarily undergraduate university and large research university, and teaching workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world."

Based on these data, undocumented species will be identified, characterized and formally described. Two major hypotheses will be tested: whether arid-adapted species of S.W. Angola are descended from East African ancestors that migrated during periods of dry climate, and whether species restricted to the Angolan highlands are ancient descendants of formerly widespread ancestors. Researchers will also test how climate factors affect the degree to which malaria-causing parasites specialize on particular lizard species.

Public outreach efforts will include development of short video documentaries and English- and Portuguese-language guides to Angola's amphibians and reptiles.<br/><br/>Surveys of the Angolan herpetofauna will be informed by current knowledge gained from the less than 8,000 specimens that currently exist in museums worldwide. A total of six expeditions throughout Angola will be undertaken over a period of three years, with each focusing on a region identified as poorly sampled based on the provenance of extant museum specimens or as key sampling areas for addressing taxonomic problems. Specimens obtained in survey efforts will be subjected to collection and analysis of ecological, genetic, and morphological data. Molecular systematic analyses of the genetic data will identify cryptic species and targeted high-throughput sequencing will be used to test biogeographic hypotheses. Morphological data collection will include external morphological examination as well as high-resolution CT scanning to identify diagnostic internal anatomical features of species under study. Ecological niche modeling of species' ranges will be used to explore patterns of faunal turnover and identify conservation priorities. All biodiversity data generated in the course of the project, including point localities, DNA sequences, and CT scans, will be made available to the broader scientific community.

For this reason, terrestrial ecosystem models are used to anticipate the centennial scale projections of forest response to environmental change. Current terrestrial ecosystem model predictions vary widely and results have large statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, testing and calibration of these models relies on short term (sub-daily to decadal) data that fail to capture longer term trends and infrequent extreme events. The capacity of ecosystem models for scientific inference and long-term prediction would be greatly improved if uncertainties can be reduced through rigorous testing against observational data. PalEON is an interdisciplinary team of paleoecologists, statisticians, and modelers that have partnered to rigorously synthesize longer term paleoecological data and incorporate into ecosystem models to provide a deeper understanding of past dynamics and to use this knowledge to improve long-term forecasting capabilities.<br/><br/>Funds are provided to address four objectives and associated research questions: 1) Validation: How well do ecosystem models simulate decadal-to-centennial dynamics when confronted with past climate change, and what limits model accuracy? 2) Initialization: How sensitive are ecosystem models to initialization state and equilibrium assumptions? Do data-constrained simulations of centennial-scale dynamics improve 20thcentury simulations? 3) Inference: Was the terrestrial biosphere a carbon sink or source during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly? and 4) Improvement: How can parameters and processes responsible for data-model divergences be improved? The data synthesis will include wide range of ecosystems, encompasses past climate variations that were large enough to affect tree growth rates, disturbance regimes, and forest demography, and leverages available paleodata. The synthesis will include 1) fossil pollen and Public Land Survey data to reconstruct forest composition, 2) sedimentary charcoal, stand-age and firescar indicators of past disturbance regimes, 3) tree-ring records of tree growth rates, and 4) multiple paleoclimatic proxies and paleoclimatic simulations. Bayesian hierarchical statistical models will be used to reconstruct key ecological variables and their associated uncertainty estimates. A standardized model intercomparison involving 13 ecosystem modeling groups will be used to evaluate the robustness of the modeling approach.<br/><br/>Three areas will be emphasized for PalEON's broader impacts. Community Building: The PalEON research community has doubled over the past 10 months, with more than 60 participants now. It is anticipated to nearly another doubling over the next five years, and the funds will allow the ongoing community-building via annual large meetings and task-oriented workshops. Interdisciplinary Training and Mentoring: A new generation of researchers will be trained to naturally conceptualize large spatial and temporal scales and to approach ecological forecasting as an integrative activity spanning data collection to model prediction. Eight postdocs and seven graduate students will be involved in proposed PalEON research, with multiple opportunities for cross-training. Additionally, the PalEON Summer Short Course provides an intensive cross-training experience for young scientists in all areas encompassed by PalEON. The 2012 course will be followed by courses in 2014 and 2016.  Building Scientific Infrastructure: All PalEON datasets will be made publicly available upon publication, as will our new data-assimilation methods and model intercomparison protocols. Tools will be developed for optimal site selection (given the goal of reducing the integrated prediction uncertainty about past vegetation and climate over space and time) and will distribute a publicly available webtool version that will be linked directly to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database."

However, significant knowledge gaps remain in the evolutionary relationships, distributions of ecologically important traits, and distributions of species. The project will undertake concerted assembling efforts that will yield near species-level completeness of key evolutionary and ecological attributes thereby establishing a global model system for macroevolution, macroecology, comparative biology and global change research. The compiled trait and spatial data will provide a vital backbone for rigorous conservation monitoring and prioritization. The online analysis and visualization tools will extend successful, existing projects and will be built to be directly usable for other taxa and other Genealogy of Life (GoLife) projects. <br/><br/><br/>Massive parallel sequencing methods will be used to collect new multi-locus genetic information for ca. 4,000 species currently lacking such data. These data will be used to derive a dated posterior tree set that includes all tetrapod species and captures remaining uncertainty. The posterior tree set will be used to calculate evolutionary distinctness and a variety of tree metrics. Together with key collaborators the researchers will compile morphological, ecological and life history trait data for dozens of variables and additionally benefit from phylogenetic imputation to predict missing values. A new tool incorporated into the existing Map of Life infrastructure will link existing species distributional datasets to global environmental data layers and provide broad-scale niche characteristics for all vertebrates together with estimates of uncertainty. Further integration will link these products to online phylogeny visualization tools to allow map- and tree-based discovery and download. Finally, the project will demonstrate the utility of the integrated layers through example biogeographic, conservation and comparative analyses that will highlight the advance in inference and in predictive conservation use arising from near-complete and unbiased global data. The research will also provide online visualizations and tutorials, a museum exhibit developed around the products, a workshop based on VertLife infrastructure, and undergraduate and graduate summer internships."

One approach to addressing these questions is to study and compare the genetic makeup of closely related species. Some of life's most striking examples of diversity have evolved in a process known as adaptive radiation, when a wide variety of closely related species arise from a common ancestor during a relatively brief period of time. Adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in certain African lakes provide captivating examples of this process, where these fishes exhibit incredible diversity in color, shape, and reproductive and feeding behaviors. Recently developed technologies make it easier to obtain large amounts of genetic data from wild organisms, so that it is now possible to document thousands of times more of the genetic makeup of these species than ever before. This project will use such genomic data to study the history of species that have formed in two African cichlid fish adaptive radiations, thus improving our understanding of how and why species have evolved, and yielding greater insight into the origins of biodiversity. In addition to its scientific goals, this work will strengthen relationships with international partners in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo through a collaborative workshop on the use of genetic data in understanding and monitoring biodiversity. It will also involve the development of educational materials for teaching about evolution and biodiversity in middle school classrooms.  <br/><br/>Adaptive radiations are exemplary systems for studying evolutionary processes due to the diversity of forms that evolve on rapid timescales. However, the rapid nature of these diversification events means that reconstructing the history of species divergence can be intensely challenging. The recent attainability of genome-wide sequence data for non-model organisms has precipitated a fundamental shift in the data that can be used to address questions related to the history of rapidly diversifying species. Such genomic datasets present new opportunities for uniting population genetics approaches with phylogenetic approaches to understand the history of species and speciation in adaptive radiation. This research will expand knowledge of how genomic data can aid in reconstructing the history of rapid adaptive radiations by studying two model cichlid adaptive radiations, Lake Kivu's haplochromine cichlids and Lake Tanganyika's tropheine cichlids. It will use newly available genomic resources to investigate the evolutionary history of these groups and the evolutionary processes influencing patterns of genetic diversity."

In particular, the tropics (the area ~23.5 north and south of the equator) harbor many more species than the temperate zones, and many of these tropical species are significantly differentiated in their physiology, behavior, and body morphology.  Some of these differences have been proposed as evolutionary drivers of species numbers; for instance, species in which females can choose from many competing males may fragment into multiple species more easily as female preferences can quickly change.  Testing this and related hypotheses requires comprehensive databases of hard-to-quantify species characteristics, including social group sizes and breeding system.  This project will produce the first publicly available large-scale data set that includes a metric of the importance of female choice, male testis size.  These data will be compiled for a large sample of New World birds, and used to test for relationships among latitude, breeding system, social system, and the rate of speciation.  Understanding these relationships is fundamental to explaining broad-scale diversity patterns, which informs conservation planning and policy.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that temperate-tropical biogeographic transitions affect the evolution of mating and social systems in New World oscine passerine birds, and ultimately that these behavioral characteristics in turn may have affected diversification rates.  Specifically, this work will focus on compilation of a data set of combined testis mass for all New World oscines based on museum specimen data, uniformly analyzed in a fashion unbiased with regard to breeding latitude.  Due to the correlation of testis size with the degree of sperm competition, these data can be used as a proxy for breeding system, to test the hypothesis that tropical habitats select for genetic monogamy, favoring the evolution of sociality (in particular, cooperative breeding).  New World oscines are ideal for addressing these issues as they are diverse, have transitioned between the tropics and temperate zone many times, are well-represented in museum collections, and nearly all have been included in species-level phylogenies (with the exception of wrens, for which this project will generate the first phylogeny).  These data and analyses will form the basis for broader tests of the relationship among latitude, species traits, and diversification rates in New World birds."

Chili peppers, used in chili powder, salsa, and hot sauce, are a major crop worth approximately $30 billion worldwide, and one of the most important vegetable spices in the world. Chili peppers evolved in the New World (Mexico, Central and South America), and are a well-known ingredient in Latin American cuisine. However, they are now an important component of traditional dishes in most Asian and some African and Pacific Island countries. Despite this significance, the species and genetic diversity in wild chili peppers and their relatives has not been well studied. Surprisingly, many of the wild relatives grow in wet rainforests and do not have spicy fruits. Understanding this diversity and the relationships among peppers and their relatives will provide important information on domestication and the genes controlling useful traits for chili pepper breeding and research. This award will fund field work to visit populations of wild chili peppers and their relatives, investigate their genetic diversity, and build an evolutionary tree showing their relationships. Illustrated descriptions for all the species in this group will be provided online, along with tools to help in their identification. The team of investigators who will carry out this project, located in Utah, California, Argentina, and England, are all experts on this group of plants. Along with realizing the scientific goals of this study, they will convey the excitement and discovery of botanical research to a wide audience through blogs from the field, media releases, and K-12 outreach at a children's garden at UC Davis. <br/>This project will advance knowledge by providing complete, detailed taxonomic and phylogenetic information on the pepper genus (Capsicum) and its sister genus (Lycianthes). Both genera lack modern, species-level treatments and robust, well-sampled phylogenies. These data are fundamental to future systematic and crop improvement work on both genera and will stimulate the examination of other biological questions such as the evolution of chili pepper pungency and key innovations such as anther pores in the Solanaceae. This project will assemble systematic information on Capsicum and Lycianthes, delimiting species, discovering new taxa, and clarifying species ranges. This is especially important in many of the wild Capsicum taxa that are narrow endemics in critically endangered ecosystems. The taxonomic component of this project will be available on-line and use the data structures and website resources created in a previously NSF-funded initiative on the genus Solanum (Solanaceae Source). All data will be freely available for re-use. The taxonomic and nomenclatural information will also be shared with aggregator institutions such as Encyclopedia of Life. Molecular data will be acquired using next-generation sequencing techniques by combining the expertise of taxonomists with that of a specialist in pepper breeding and genomics. These data will be used to produce the most densely sampled phylogenies of Capsicum and Lycianthes to date. The genomic information and data generated during this project may have broad applicability in plant phylogenetics and the improvement of other solanaceous crops. This research will solve the complex and uncertain relationship between the two genera and provide the framework for the study of evolution and domestication in one of the world?s most important vegetable spices.

This paucity of botanical information about the region impedes critical research on the past, present, and future of Amazonian plant diversity. This project will compile inventories of the plants of two protected areas in the region that are critical for the study and management of biodiversity. The primary goal is to produce an interactive open-access, web-based conspectus guide to the plants of the two areas. Project data will be shared with the global research community and Brazilian governmental agencies so that the plant resources and natural ecosystems contained within the two areas might be more effectively studied, protected, and managed. Beyond its basic scientific value, the project will advance scientific collaboration between the US and Brazil by sponsoring inter-institutional research travel by project personnel and by providing training opportunities for American and Brazilian students.<br/><br/>This project will produce comprehensive inventories of the vascular plants of Tapajos National Forest and Amazonia National Park. These will be the first such inventories for any comparably sized areas in southeast Amazonia. The project will combine a synthesis of existing data with intensive collecting of herbarium specimens and tissue samples for DNA-based studies. General collecting and plot-based inventory approaches will be implemented to maximize species recovery. Identification of specimens will rely on traditional morphologically based approaches, as well as DNA barcoding. The two inventories will constitute critical datasets for comparison with previously documented Amazonian floras. Project data will be useful for testing hypotheses about the distribution of Amazonian plant diversity and will contribute toward efforts to model projected floristic change. It is highly probable that the research will extend the known limits of plant distributions and will result in the discovery of significant new taxonomic diversity. A web-based conspectus flora will be supported by state-of-the-art informatics technologies and will make project data and other resources broadly available for diverse areas of research that require the accurate identification of plant species.

Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, relatively new technologies such as remote sensing from satellites and aircraft, and observation networks are providing large quantities of environmental data, such as rainfall, vegetation productivity, structure, connectivity and more at landscape and macrosystem scales that were not previously possible. These advances in technology, along with increased connectivity of internet users, have allowed a broader involvement of the public in collecting animal or environmental data. The challenge in many cases has been to link the animal-observations information, being collected by citizens, local groups, as well as national and international agencies, to relevant large-scale environmental datasets. This project addresses these issues in a workshop with experts that have helped advance the new technologies associated with animal detections and environmental data at landscape and macrosystem scales.<br/><br/>The explicitly inter-disciplinary nature of the workshop will foster linkages and collaborations that aim to alleviate technical barriers for scaling the information from animal observations to environmental datasets at macrosystem scales. Such barriers currently limit researchers from broadening the scale and scope of their research. There will be a two-day workshop that focuses on how new technologies and capabilities that investigate the distribution and movement of animals can be linked to environmental states and environmental changes at the landscape and macrosystem scales. The workshop will bring together experts in the fields of remote sensing and animal detection with the goal of integrating the various technologies and lay the foundation for a review paper on the potential of combined techniques to answer important questions in ecology and conservation biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For this project, the investigators will integrate statistical models for describing how fossils are sampled over time and where species are found. These models for estimating species relationships will be developed in widely used software packages, making them broadly accessible to other researchers. These new methods will be tested using both simulated and real datasets. Specifically, two vertebrate groups with rich fossil records will be studied: penguins and crocodyliforms (crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and extinct relatives). This work will help to uncover how rates of speciation and extinction have changed over time for these species. The methods developed as part of this project will be taught in workshops for evolutionary biologists. Additionally, results from analyses of data from living and fossil penguins will be contributed to a public museum exhibit at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, CT. <br/><br/>In recent years, advances in phylogenetic inference methods have provided ways to integrate fossil and extant taxa. These approaches allow simultaneous estimation of the divergence times and phylogenetic relationships of extant and fossil species, thus making full use of morphological and temporal data, rather than just molecular sequence data from living species. Approaches combining fossil and extant taxa have opened the door for fully integrative phylogenetic methods that use more sources of biological data, including stratigraphy, sampling, and biogeography. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive statistical models and methods that accommodate this information. The investigators will develop new, Bayesian statistical models, extensions of stochastic birth-death processes, that will integrate information about the fossil record and biogeography for use in phylogenetic methods that consider both extant and fossil taxa. The new models will be implemented in the program RevBayes. The performance and adequacy of new and previously described models will be evaluated using simulated and empirical datasets.

This question is at the heart of evolutionary ecology, but has been very difficult to answer. A major problem is that current analytical approaches, known as phylogenetic comparative methods, require that a single value be used to represent a trait for an entire species. As a result, valuable information on differences among individuals within a species can't be used. This limits the types of questions that these comparative methods can address. The main goal of this project is to develop new analytical software that accounts for trait variation within species, which will result in a much more powerful computational tool. The newly developed software will be tested using experimental data from salamanders and fish. This award will have multiple broader impacts. This new tool will let a whole new set of hypotheses be tested and will be widely used by scientists doing evolutionary ecology research. Undergraduate students will receive hands-on training in mathematical modeling and software development. Educational outreach activities include a research-education exchange between a regional undergraduate university and a large research university. National and international teaching workshops will help train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world.<br/><br/>Analyses of phenotypic data tend to remain distinctly different enterprises between microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies. Consequently, we still do not know how microevolutionary trends from ecological selection associate to macroevolutionary trends across phylogenies. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) measure the amount of phylogenetic signal in a set of data or account for the phylogenetic relatedness among observations when evaluating ecological variation, but currently work only with single values for species. Thus, large amounts of within-species data are disregarded when using PCMs, which limits their inferential capability. This project will develop an analytical solution to this problem, and provide a framework for extending PCMs to large data sets comprising microevolutionary data. The methods developed will allow scientists to evaluate the consistency of small-scale and large scale evolutionary relationships in a comparative framework. This project will incorporate both theoretical and empirical components.  Statistical research will evaluate the statistical power and inferential error rates of ""expanded-PCM"" to varied analytical designs, phenotypic variables, tree topologies, and data balance. These methods will be applied empirically to two vertebrate systems to study the phylogenetic relatedness of intra-species morphological variation, as it is associated with intra- and interspecific ecological variation. Several educational outreach activities will also be conducted, including: a research-in-education exchange between a primarily undergraduate university and large research university, and teaching workshops in quantitative methods to train the next generation of students and scientists from around the world."

This is a challenge because of the complex network of connections among the living organisms and the non-living parts of ecosystems.  Mathematical models are essential tools to keep track of these ecological interactions and to predict how they will respond to environmental changes. However, models need to be linked to data from nature. Two major challenges in developing predictive models of environmental change are 1) collecting sufficient data on how interactions among a complete set of species and environmental factors change over time, and (2) rigorously testing model predictions with experiments. This study will combine a quarter-century long series of data on 100+ species and relevant environmental variables in the rocky shoreline of Tatoosh Island in Washington state, with a long-term field experiment that mimics the extinction of a key species, the California mussel. The long term data will be applied to several different modeling approaches and predictions from these models will subsequently be tested with the long-term field experiment. The research will identify the most promising modeling approaches for making ecological prediction, and make them available to ecosystem managers and policy makers interested in the consequences of environmental impacts such as species extinction and global change. The comprehensive data series also will be made available to other scientists to be used as a platform for additional studies.  This project will also engage undergraduate students in field research, data management, mathematical modeling, and in communicating with the public, managers, and policy makers. Furthermore, because the challenge of understanding networks of species interactions is shared with other scientific disciplines that deal with complex networks, project results will be of general value in other disciplines. <br/><br/>The researcher will conduct annual surveys of replicated permanent plots for plants and animals on the shoreline in two ways: 1) by documenting the species identities under 2,600 fixed points over a 5-year period and generating annual transition probabilities among species, and 2) by generating abundance estimates in permanent 60 x 60 cm census plots.  Fifteen experimental plots will be maintained by selectively removing individuals of Mytilus californianus when they appear, leaving all other species undisturbed.  Environmental data will be collected every 30 minutes using a submersible data logger and a land-based weather station. Water chemistry, including critical nutrients, will be monitored.  These data will be analyzed in several ways, including 1) parameterizing transition-based models (Markov chain models, spatially-explicit cellular automata) with environmental dependencies, 2) parameterizing multi-species population dynamic models from plot counts, 3) applying multi-spatial cross-convergent mapping and testing whether it accurately detects key species known to have strong causal effects from independent experiments, 4) applying neural network models and testing their predictions about the consequences of species extinction, and 5) testing whether there is a relationship between the variability of a species' abundance through time and its importance to the ecosystem as assessed by independent experiments. The community modeling projects enabled by the rich long term data sets have a strong potential to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying community dynamics and their response to environmental change."

Currently, one of the biggest challenges is analyzing the data in ways that reliably extract signals from noise.  Specifically, genome sequences from individuals in a population contain information that can be used to unravel the biological history of the population and to discover which genes are adaptive, deleterious, or just along for the ride.  However, extracting this information and using it to draw such conclusions is a far from trivial undertaking due to the massive scale of modern datasets and due to the many complex and interrelated factors that affect how populations change over time.  The proposed research will develop new computational methods for inference from population genomic data.  The development of these new methods aims to improve scientists' abilities to use population genomic data to answer a variety of questions, such as: What are the genetic changes associated with adaptation? How repeatable and predictable are the genetic changes associated with the diversification of an ancestral species into a variety of modern species (i.e., an ""adaptive radiation"")?  The new methods will be applied to two independent examples of adaptive radiations involving butterflies commonly found in North and Central America because a wealth of excellent data and technical resources already exist for these species.  Beyond making inferences about these particular groups of species, the proposed research will have broader impacts in two main ways.  First, the novel computational methods and software developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to genetic analysis in a variety of basic and applied scientific disciplines.  This open-source software will be freely disseminated.  Second, the results will form the basis for constructing educational museum exhibits on genomics and the tree of life.<br/><br/>Natural selection and speciation are the fundamental evolutionary processes responsible for life's fantastic diversity, yet the genes and specific genetic changes responsible for adaptive traits and the genetic mechanisms that cause speciation are largely unknown. Emerging molecular and analytical methods offer great promise to address these issues, but studies of speciation are generally limited by at least two factors. First, studies of a single example of divergence (e.g., in one hybrid zone) suffer from the ""n=1"" problem: without replication of divergence, the generalities from a single species pair are unclear.  Second, a priori quantitative predictions from multiple, contrasting hypotheses are rarely developed; indeed, there is often little consensus about the patterns expected under a given verbal hypothesis about evolutionary processes. The proposed research will address both issues by using existing empirical data and development of novel theoretical methods to investigate how the species boundary evolves over space and time using multiple species pairs in two independent examples of adaptive diversification among hybridizing lineages of mimetic butterflies: Heliconius and Limenitis. Specifically, researchers will: 1) collaborate to statistically characterize the empirical systems and 2) develop population genomic theory and test quantitative predictions about the accumulation of genomic divergence across the species boundary continuum. The results of this project will provide a uniquely comprehensive portrait of the evolving species boundary in a comparative framework, and will thereby provide a powerful examination of questions about the generalities of evolutionary processes and genomic patterns that characterize speciation at multiple points along the continuum of divergence. These questions include: How porous is the species boundary among hybridizing species? How does divergent selection shape genomic variation among hybridizing lineages? How predictable is the evolving genomic architecture of speciation? In addition to answering these questions, the work will yield broadly applicable computational methods for quantitatively testing hypotheses about the genomic signatures of multiple evolutionary processes acting alone or in concert."

Some of the most interesting diversity involves ecomorphs, which are different species that have evolved to have similar body forms and behaviors that adapt them to the same ecological niche. It is known that the same ecomorph often evolves independently many times, but little is known about what explains overall patterns of ecomorph evolution. For example, is evolutionary change between some ecomorphs more common than others, and what explains these differences? In this project, a new, integrative approach will be developed to explore these fundamental questions about evolution, using frogs as a model system. The approach combines reconstructing species ancestry, (i.e., their evolutionary relationships), with data on species ecology, body morphology, physiological performance (how well they jump, swim, and climb), and their geographic distribution. This study will provide the first exploration of how these different factors explain large-scale patterns of ecomorph evolution across this major group of organisms. To address these factors, the investigators will develop statistical tools that can be applied to any group of organisms. General questions about the methods used to reconstruct evolutionary trees with genetic data will also be addressed. This project will support training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in a diversity of disciplines and techniques. The training will also include a summer undergraduate research experience, with students recruited from historically underrepresented groups. Outreach talks and a video on the project's goals, results, and implications will be delivered to public audiences. <br/><br/>This project has two major objectives. First, a new large-scale phylogeny of anurans will be developed, using new phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements and existing supermatrices. Urgent and general questions about the methodology of phylogenomic analyses will also be addressed. Second, the investigators will estimate patterns of transitions in ecomorphs and test the factors that explain these patterns. Specifically, researchers will collect morphological data from museum specimens for ~2,500 species.  They will also collect new performance data for 65 targeted species from North America, Europe, Africa, and Madagascar, and add this to their existing performance data for 63 species from Asia, Australia, and North and South America.  Data will be obtained on microhabitats and analyzed in the context of the new phylogeny to estimate transition rates among microhabitat-associated ecomorphs. Several hypotheses will then be tested about why transition rates differ among ecomorphs, including hypotheses related to ecomorph morphology, functional performance, diversification rates, and biogeography. Data will come from the scientific literature, specimens from scientific collections, and fieldwork in North America, Europe, and Africa."

Damage to urban forests was widespread. Many trees were uprooted or lost leaves and limbs. As in previous storms, tree damage from Irma is unlikely to be felt equally across communities. Since urban forests provide many important services, understanding what causes differences in impacts between communities is critical to recovery. Patterns of damage may depend on proximity to buildings and which species were present. Management practices, as well as average household income and age of housing, are also likely to be important. Therefore, the goal of this project is to understand how local ecological, social and economic conditions relate to the severity of damage to urban forests from Hurricane Irma. Irma provides a unique and urgent opportunity to learn how urban forests are affected by hurricanes, allowing communities to better predict where tree loss may be high. This will lead to better preparation and effective recovery plans for future storm events. Presentations and workshops will provide information to urban planners and tree care professionals, helping improve urban forest design, tree risk assessment and storm management efforts. <br/><br/>This project will provide an opportunity to directly evaluate urban tree canopy responses to hurricanes, and differences in tree damage related to biophysical and social characteristics. This project will build on existing measurements, utilizing field inventory data obtained in the months prior to the storm in Tampa, Gainesville, and Orange County, Florida. Field plots will be re-visited to obtain post-storm data assessing tree failure. These data will be used in conjunction with remotely sensed data obtained before and after the storm, as well as census data to establish socioeconomic context. This combination of field measurements, census data, and remotely sensed data products will allow inference about relationships between socioeconomic and forest structural factors and tree failure. The findings and predictions will directly address larger-scale questions about how urban forest ecosystems are altered in the face of future disturbance scenarios. This project will also improve estimates of the overall consequences of hurricanes to urban forests, allowing policy makers to make better decisions to manage the ecosystem services of this important resource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Without an array of species inhabiting a range of environments, the cycles of water, nutrients and biomass on which life depends would be severely compromised. Despite this, understanding exactly how diversity influences specific environmental processes is challenging. Although there are theories describing the influence of plant species diversity on environmental processes, they?ve primarily been tested in grasslands and other systems dominated by small plants, where diversity can be manipulated through planting and weeding. Forests present a challenge because the size and lifespans of trees make it difficult to conduct manipulative diversity experiments and because natural diversity gradients also vary in climate, making results difficult to interpret. Overcoming this hurdle is critical given the importance of forests to many environmental processes and the degree to which forest diversity is declining. This award will examine whether theories of biological diversity and environmental processes that have been largely tested in small-statured ecosystems also apply to macro-scale processes over North American forests. By integrating data on carbon, water, and energy exchanges between forests and the atmosphere, remote sensing of forest diversity, and field measurements, will enable the development of forest diversity for the US and the relationship to land-atmosphere exchange of carbon and water. It will quantify the important role of forests in the Earth system and the degree to which forest diversity is declining. The award will involve undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of the project, and through additional activities that bring new methods of remote sensing to private citizens, teachers and students at multiple levels. This will be accomplished through workshops and through development of focused activities that can be adopted by teachers and used in the classroom. The undergraduates working on the project will participate in the University of New Hampshire?s Undergraduate Research Conference (URC), one of the largest undergraduate research events in the country.  <br/><br/>Understanding how diversity influences specific ecosystem and earth system functions within individual biomes is extremely difficult and is considered one of the grand challenges in ecology. Meeting this challenge is important given the number of species worldwide that have already gone extinct or have been threatened by habitat loss, pests and pathogens, harvesting, competition from non-native species, pollution, and climate change.  This award will examine the effects of tree diversity in forests across the U.S. on the uptake of CO2, the transfer of water from soils to the atmosphere, and on the stability of these processes in response to climate variability. The award will test the following specific hypotheses:<br/>(A) Biological diversity in North American forests has a positive effect on primary production and a negative effect on evapotranspiration, leading to increased water use efficiency. (B) Forests with high levels of diversity are less susceptible to extreme events and exhibit less temporal variability in carbon and water fluxes in response to climate fluctuations than low-diversity forests. These hypotheses will be addressed by bringing together several unique sources of data that have not previously been used to address this question. First, the research sites to be used are equipped with instrumented towers that make detailed measurements of CO2 and water vapor above the forest canopy, as well as a range of climate and ecological variables. Second, advanced remote sensing instruments will be used to measure tree canopy diversity in ways that field surveys alone cannot. These data will come from unmanned aerial systems as well as instruments that are part of the National Ecological Observatory. Through the unique nature of these data sets and advanced methods of data analysis, results will be used to quantify the specific signature of diversity on important processes at a broad geographic scale."

This largely land-based classification system has been very useful in conducting research and understanding the environmental, geological, and biological features of those regions. These factors influence how ecological systems within the biome are structured and how they function. The classification scheme provides a framework for site- specific research to be understood in a larger regional context and scale the results to the larger region. A weakness or missing part of this framework is streams and rivers. Most maps or lists of biomes of the world would suggest that flowing waters are so similar to one another that all streams can be lumped into a single category. They are generally lumped together regardless of the regional geology, watershed vegetation, or climatic factors. This research will develop a biome classification system for streams to better understand how streams function and provide an ability to predict how streams will change from human and environmental factors.<br/><br/>This continental scale project will address the deceptively simple question: is there such a thing as a stream biome? From an ecosystem perspective we now know that inland waters play critical roles in both global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. The physical diversity of lotic waters as well as their tendency is more temporally dynamic than terrestrial systems. Ultimately the phenology of stream ecosystem energetics will be a function of energy supply (light and fixed terrestrial carbon) and fixed carbon removal (via hydrologic disturbance). Watershed structure determines the route and rate at which water enters stream channels while watershed vegetation determines the magnitude and timing of fixed carbon inputs and the degree and temporal patterning of light availability. This research effort will increase the measurements of annual metabolism by nearly two orders of magnitude. At the present time there exist only two streams for which annual metabolic rates have been calculated using continuous dissolved oxygen measurements. By the conclusion of this project 55 years of high quality metabolism data will have been generated for a total of 35 streams, and the project PIs will have acquired (via leveraged funds and collaborations) metabolism data for at least 196 additional streams. Metabolism metrics from all of these streams will be used to build the first hierarchical classification of stream ecosystems based on their seasonal and annual patterns of primary productivity and ecosystem respiration. Stream biome delineation will facilitate estimation of stream metabolic rates at timescales of days to years for spatial scales from reaches to river networks. Simulation models, developed from first principles and refined with empirical data specific to each biome, will forecast changes in metabolic rates in response to likely climate and land use change scenarios. The data management plan has been designed in collaboration with informatics staff of the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics and USGS has agreed to host and help develop a public data repository, modeling, and data visualization platform specifically designed to collate long-term or high-resolution metabolism and dissolved oxygen datasets for streams. By building, refining and activating a community data platform this research program will change the way individual streams are studied and will facilitate and encourage near instantaneous cross-site synthesis. In addition to capacity building, this project will directly support seven graduate students and 7 postdoctoral associates over the funding period."

Barker, PI and Katrina M. Dlugosch, CoPI<br/> <br/>Plants are rooted in place and cannot escape harsh environmental conditions. Instead, many plant species can acclimate to varying environments by modifying their structure or growth habit. In some cases, the acclimation is visible, as in the example of plants that grow small leaves or flower earlier when the local environment becomes water stressed. In other cases, the response to environmental change is not visible because subtle biochemical or genetic modes of survival are activated. This so-called ""genomic plasticity"" allows plants such as invasive species to thrive in new or harsh niches compared with less responsive plants. Similarly, plants with highly duplicated genomes, termed polyploids, may acclimate better because they express more variation in diverse traits in response to environmental change. Understanding how adaptive plasticity occurs is critical to being able to predict plant responses to environmental change. This project uses the novel environmental and biodiversity data from NEON to investigate the genomic basis of plasticity. To study adaptive plasticity of plants in the NEON footprint, new sequencing technologies will be used to characterize all the genes expressed over several time periods in selected polyploids and invasive species. These results will be compared against the abundance and plant community structure of the species included in the NEON biodiversity data. The project will thus establish the foundation for an unprecedented view of how plant genomes, and their subsequent traits, change over time. The study both leverages and expands NEON's long-term data to determine how plasticity at the genome level may predict plant success. <br/><br/>Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is one of the primary means by which species respond to climatic variation, but how plasticity functions in plant genomes is not well understood. Plasticity is not easy to identify or study because homeostasis in key traits can be maintained by plasticity at underlying levels of organization. This research circumvents this problem by using genomic measures of plasticity to track response to environmental variation in plants across the NEON network. To measure and document plasticity, the project combines transcriptome profiles from RNA sequencing of selected plants at a NEON core site with NEON surveys of plant community composition. The specific activities are to (1) identify ploidy levels in species at the Harvard Forest NEON core site and select target polyploid, diploid and invasive species for the study; (2) conduct RNA sequencing of 30 target species and (3) correlate genome plasticity with species abundance. The project leverages NEON's long-term study sites and data, while extending the power of NEON's plant diversity data to the genomic level. Measurements of genomic plasticity will provide highly relevant and comparable metrics of plastic responses to the environment across taxa, space, and time. The data and analytical tools will be publicly available through NCBI and the iPlant Collaborative, and will benefit society by providing methods to predict how plants in uncertain environments will respond to change."

For this reason, terrestrial ecosystem models are used to anticipate the centennial scale projections of forest response to environmental change. Current terrestrial ecosystem model predictions vary widely and results have large statistical uncertainties.

Responses vary within and among species, with variation in the local and regional environment, and in response to external pressures such as insect infestations making extrapolation from individual plant to species-specific studies difficult. Plant leaf functional traits (e.g. leaf chemistry, plant pigments) have recently emerged as a potentially useful way to characterize and understand the variability in plant function (e.g. growth, stress, nutrient uptake), and plant responses to environmental change. Plant leaf traits or ""foliar traits"" have been shown to be strongly correlated with global variation in plant function and can be detected from remotely sensed imagery. Remote sensing offers the possibility to characterize and map the spatial variation in foliar functional traits to gain a better understanding of biological responses to global change. Remotely sensed and ground based measurements from the National Ecological Observatory will be used to develop a suite of foliar traits from 81 locations that encompass the range of ecosystems found in the United States. One component of the National Ecological Observatory infrastructure is its Aerial Observation Platform, which collects remote imagery annually over the locations using the latest generation imaging technologies. These imaging sensors have an unprecedented ability to map biological function, including plant chemistry and physiology, as well as the biomass and structure of plants. This award will result in the first comprehensive data set and methods for mapping plant biochemistry and physiology across the range of ecosystem types in the US and will enable characterization of how plant traits vary across space and time. The leaf traits, supporting data, maps and enabling equations and software will be made publically available via existing databases. Graduate students and post doctoral candidates will be engaged in the research.<br/><br/>One of the great promises of imaging spectroscopy ? also known as hyperspectral remote sensing ? is the ability to map the spatial variation in foliar functional traits, such as nitrogen concentration, pigments, leaf structure, photosynthetic capacity and secondary biochemistry, that drive terrestrial ecosystem processes. Such foliar trait characterization offers an organizing principle that can be used to understand the occurrence and evolutionary differentiation of function across different taxonomic or phylogenetic levels and to detect functional differences across ecosystems.  The National Ecological Observatory provides one of the first opportunities to characterize and compare these different ecosystem types, in terms of their biodiversity and ecosystem services such as maintaining air and water quality and sequestering and storing carbon. The imaging spectrometer on the National Ecological Observatory Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) will be used to regularly estimate trait variation across the major biomes of North America, providing high-resolution data suitable for scaling these traits continentally, as well as ecosystem modeling across domains. The award will enable hyperspectral mapping algorithms for a large number of plant foliar traits (such as nitrogen concentration, pigments, LMA, photosynthetic capacity and secondary metabolites) to be developed (or modified from existing algorithms), validated, applied and made publicly available. To accomplish this will entail fundamental research in remote sensing to understand how optical properties - detectable using imaging spectroscopy - permit mapping traits across biomes. Additionally the data will permit the evaluation of how trait retrieval algorithms differ across biomes and how they are affected by vegetation structure, physiognomy, or other ecosystem properties. Lidar data will be used to test and control for the influence of canopy vertical structure on trait mapping. The resulting maps of vegetation trait variation will be analyzed to determine the requisite geographic area that must be sampled to fully characterize trait variation across ecosystem types and, subsequently, compare to global variation. The ultimate objective is the synthesis, testing and validation of cross-biome trait retrieval models for hyperspectral imagery. By characterizing how multi-dimensional trait space is filled across landscapes and comparing the resulting trait maps with global data, this research will identify the extent to which hyperspectral imagery can be used to both extrapolate trait variation on Earth and fill geographical gaps in existing knowledge of biome- to continental- scale trait variation. Comprehensive trait information for the biomes represented in the Observatory is largely absent except for localized studies, and this work will enable better understanding and prediction of the response of global terrestrial ecosystems to disturbance, stress and change. This work will provide the scientific community with data products necessary to better understand local-, regional-, continental- and global-scale variation in ecosystem function, in part through linkage to a range of other data (e.g. flux tower estimates of GPP). The project will train students and postdoctoral scholars in cross-disciplinary research that merges ecology, remote sensing, and the quantitative analyses of dense data sets, creating a new generation of researchers that can address cross-cutting questions in global ecology."

Do data-constrained simulations of centennial-scale dynamics improve 20thcentury simulations? 3) Inference: Was the terrestrial biosphere a carbon sink or source during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly? and 4) Improvement: How can parameters and processes responsible for data-model divergences be improved? The data synthesis will include wide range of ecosystems, encompasses past climate variations that were large enough to affect tree growth rates, disturbance regimes, and forest demography, and leverages available paleodata. The synthesis will include 1) fossil pollen and Public Land Survey data to reconstruct forest composition, 2) sedimentary charcoal, stand-age and firescar indicators of past disturbance regimes, 3) tree-ring records of tree growth rates, and 4) multiple paleoclimatic proxies and paleoclimatic simulations. Bayesian hierarchical statistical models will be used to reconstruct key ecological variables and their associated uncertainty estimates. A standardized model intercomparison involving 13 ecosystem modeling groups will be used to evaluate the robustness of the modeling approach.<br/><br/>Three areas will be emphasized for PalEON's broader impacts. Community Building: The PalEON research community has doubled over the past 10 months, with more than 60 participants now. It is anticipated to nearly another doubling over the next five years, and the funds will allow the ongoing community-building via annual large meetings and task-oriented workshops. Interdisciplinary Training and Mentoring: A new generation of researchers will be trained to naturally conceptualize large spatial and temporal scales and to approach ecological forecasting as an integrative activity spanning data collection to model prediction. Eight postdocs and seven graduate students will be involved in proposed PalEON research, with multiple opportunities for cross-training. Additionally, the PalEON Summer Short Course provides an intensive cross-training experience for young scientists in all areas encompassed by PalEON. The 2012 course will be followed by courses in 2014 and 2016.  Building Scientific Infrastructure: All PalEON datasets will be made publicly available upon publication, as will our new data-assimilation methods and model intercomparison protocols. Tools will be developed for optimal site selection (given the goal of reducing the integrated prediction uncertainty about past vegetation and climate over space and time) and will distribute a publicly available webtool version that will be linked directly to the Neotoma Paleoecology Database."

Although methods for combining these data have made significant advances, these approaches still do not consider the completeness and sampling of the fossil record or the geographical distributions of living and fossil species. For this project, the investigators will integrate statistical models for describing how fossils are sampled over time and where species are found. These models for estimating species relationships will be developed in widely used software packages, making them broadly accessible to other researchers. These new methods will be tested using both simulated and real datasets. Specifically, two vertebrate groups with rich fossil records will be studied: penguins and crocodyliforms (crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and extinct relatives). This work will help to uncover how rates of speciation and extinction have changed over time for these species. The methods developed as part of this project will be taught in workshops for evolutionary biologists. Additionally, results from analyses of data from living and fossil penguins will be contributed to a public museum exhibit at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, CT. <br/><br/>In recent years, advances in phylogenetic inference methods have provided ways to integrate fossil and extant taxa. These approaches allow simultaneous estimation of the divergence times and phylogenetic relationships of extant and fossil species, thus making full use of morphological and temporal data, rather than just molecular sequence data from living species. Approaches combining fossil and extant taxa have opened the door for fully integrative phylogenetic methods that use more sources of biological data, including stratigraphy, sampling, and biogeography. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive statistical models and methods that accommodate this information. The investigators will develop new, Bayesian statistical models, extensions of stochastic birth-death processes, that will integrate information about the fossil record and biogeography for use in phylogenetic methods that consider both extant and fossil taxa. The new models will be implemented in the program RevBayes. The performance and adequacy of new and previously described models will be evaluated using simulated and empirical datasets. New methods will be used to investigate macroevolutionary patterns in two exemplar clades: Sphenisciformes (penguins) and Crocodyliformes, addressing key hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships, lineage diversification, and biogeography."

The methods to be developed in this research project will be announced in scientific journals, and will be provided in free, open-source software enabling researchers to apply the new methods to their own data.  This project will also facilitate interdisciplinary training of postdoctoral associates, graduate students and faculty in biology and statistics.

One reason for this may be the fact that marginal likelihoods and topology posterior probabilities are required for estimating Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, and accurate means of estimating these quantities have only recently been achieved. Correspondingly, primary objectives for this research are: (1) Evaluate the utility of KL-based information content measurement to answer a diversity of questions important to systematists, including: (a) How much information about tree topology is present in a data set? (b) Can topological information be separated from information about substitution model parameters? (c) How much information does one data subset have compared to a different data subset? (d) Do two data subsets contain conflicting phylogenetic information? (e) How much information is there about particular model parameters (e.g. a divergence time of interest)? (f) How much information is there for resolving particular clades? (2) Explore issues related to information content, such as: (a) a topological information content definition of saturation; (b) a KL-based method for estimating variable-tree marginal likelihoods for purposes of model selection; and (c) polytomy analyses. (3) Implement KL estimation of information content in existing Bayesian phylogenetics software to make it freely available to the systematics community. These objectives will be pursued using the variable tree IDR method to provide accurate estimates of all marginal likelihoods needed for KL estimation. The recently published conditional clade method allows accurate posterior probabilities of tree topologies to be estimated from sample conditional clade frequencies. Computer simulation experiments and analyses of relevant real world data sets will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of KL in measuring information content and in providing answers to the questions posed above."

Diversification can be a slow process or a rapid one, and the dynamics of why some groups become very diverse with hundreds of species, while others have just a few is an especially relevant field of study given a dynamically changing environment. Adaptive radiation theory predicts an increase in speciation rates resulting from adaptations in response to ecological opportunity, and that speciation rates are initially high, but decrease as ecological niches fill or extinction rates increase. Several iconic groups of animals have served as testing grounds for adaptive radiation theory, but few plant studies have focused on testing predictions of the theory. Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) is the largest plant genus native to North America, with nearly 300 species, and is an excellent example of a group that had undergone rapid diversification since the Pleistocene. Penstemon, diversified rapidly, with hundreds of species, during the Pleistocene when changing climatic conditions resulted in the melting of massive ice sheets covering much of the northern hemisphere. This research will study the effect of changing environment on organisms and how they adapt to climatic niches through speciation. The project will integrate systematics and bioinformatics training for graduate students and will result in open-source bioinformatics tools and web-based biodiversity data for the general public, scientists, and educators.<br/><br/>This project will generate next-generation sequencing data and develop novel species trees methods to test adaptive radiation theory in Penstemon. The project will generate next-generation targeted amplicon sequencing data from multiple loci, however handling the large volumes of data associated with collecting genomic data has been a technological challenge. To solve this issue the project will develop new methods of analyses to handle data sets with many taxa and large amounts of data and the project will develop a coalescent-based approach for estimating a species tree from multi-locus data. The species tree inferred will be used to examine rates of species diversification across the genus, specifically elucidating whether clades exhibit patterns consistent with those predicted by adaptive radiation theory.  Morphological characters, ecological habitats, seed germination requirements, incidence of hybridization, and geographical data will be analyzed to determine if there are key innovations and/or ecological opportunities that may explain differences in speciation rates across the genus. Additionally, new methods of analyses will be developed for detecting patterns of hybridization in a genus that has a rapid rate of diversification."

Evolution is an ongoing process but depends strongly on the past. While nearly everyone acknowledges this fact, it has been difficult to quantify the relative importance of historical and current selection pressures as explanations of patterns in nature. This research will look at the factors that have determined the amount of self-pollination versus outcrossing in the American bellflower (Campanulastrum americanum). The project will immerse undergraduate and graduate students in the collection of next-generation DNA sequence data to reconstruct historical events and studies of current selective environment in the study species. Analyses of data from these disparate sources into a single, unified framework will provide a clearer understanding of the processes shaping complex patterns in nature, and yields a predictive framework that can be applied in any biological system. Broad dissemination of this predictive approach is valuable because it will help predict the response of species to increasingly altered environments in the modern age.<br/><br/>Plant mating systems are evolutionarily labile, ranging from highly outcrossing to highly inbreeding. This wide variation provides an excellent system for understanding the ultimate drivers of evolutionary change. Variable mating system strategies across levels of the biological hierarchy are commonly explained as adaptations to the current selective environment. A significant fraction of this variation, however, may reflect historical evolution in response to colonization during range expansion. This idea will be tested using Campanulastrum americanum, a North American herb in which preliminary data indicate reduced inbreeding depression and greater autogamy in sites where phylogeographic data suggest recent colonization. Using populations a range of distances from glacial refugia, the researchers will gather data with coalescent analysis of RAD-seq polymorphism, greenhouse studies of fixed and segregating genetic load, field studies of pollen limitation and reproductive assurance, and population-genetic inferences of selfing rates. Analyses of these data will determine whether initially non-adaptive processes associated with range expansion provided a permissive environment for later evolution of the mating system. The research framework therefore provides a mechanism for discerning the ultimate drivers of organismal change across past and present time scales."

Some of the most interesting diversity involves ecomorphs, which are different species that have evolved to have similar body forms and behaviors that adapt them to the same ecological niche. It is known that the same ecomorph often evolves independently many times, but little is known about what explains overall patterns of ecomorph evolution. For example, is evolutionary change between some ecomorphs more common than others, and what explains these differences? In this project, a new, integrative approach will be developed to explore these fundamental questions about evolution, using frogs as a model system. The approach combines reconstructing species ancestry, (i.e., their evolutionary relationships), with data on species ecology, body morphology, physiological performance (how well they jump, swim, and climb), and their geographic distribution. This study will provide the first exploration of how these different factors explain large-scale patterns of ecomorph evolution across this major group of organisms. To address these factors, the investigators will develop statistical tools that can be applied to any group of organisms. General questions about the methods used to reconstruct evolutionary trees with genetic data will also be addressed. This project will support training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in a diversity of disciplines and techniques. The training will also include a summer undergraduate research experience, with students recruited from historically underrepresented groups.

Evolutionary trees permit predictions about the traits that organisms possess based on traits present in closely related species. This has important practical benefits in areas like medicine, conservation biology, and crop improvement. Although building small trees from DNA from just a few genes is straightforward, many obstacles remain to scaling up this effort to all life. One of the most serious is missing data. Under some conditions, even a few gene sequences missing for a handful of species can produce evolutionary trees that lack detailed resolution. This grant is a collaboration among biologists, mathematicians and computer scientists to understand the circumstances in which missing data cause problems, and to develop methods to overcome them.  The research will generate mathematically provable results and new software to help biologists build more reliable large evolutionary trees. These products will be tested with real world data sampled from flowering plants, one of the most diverse branches of the tree of life, with over 250,000 species. The high quality evolutionary trees generated because of this project will provide a societal need by providing clear evolutionary knowledge to inform conservation planning and prioritization. The research team will organize a workshop for graduate students around the country to train them in the use of these new tools, and will develop educational materials for high school students involving computer visualization of the tree of life.<br/><br/><br/>The construction of very large phylogenetic trees from sequence data mined from databases can be challenging because of the recently discovered problem of terraces--potentially vast regions in ""tree space"" in which all trees have precisely the same optimality score due to missing data. This research focuses first on developing a better conceptual understanding of four problematic impacts of terraces on large tree construction: (i) increased ambiguity, (ii) biased confidence assessments obtained from bootstrapping or Bayesian posterior probabilities, (iii) impediments to tree search algorithms, and (iv) downstream effects on comparative inferences that rely on trees. Next, the research will develop analytical methods and software implementations to overcome these problems. Finally, it will test these new methods by applying them to 27 large-scale phylogenies newly constructed within flowering plants, each with 1000+ species, examining trait evolution, as an exemplar of downstream comparative inference, in a subset of these."

Despite their ecological importance, information on their evolutionary relationships and taxonomy is broadly scattered and often difficult to interpret.  This project will compile systematics and taxonomic research on freshwater red algae over the past 25 years, in addition to recent distribution and habitat data, to produce a comprehensive synthesis of the group. The culmination of this two-year award will be a book that includes taxonomic keys, photographs and distribution maps that will be accessible to a wide audience. Along with the book, publically available web-based resources will be updated with distributional, environmental and genetic information so that the data will be widely available for reuse.  Two undergraduate students will be trained through individualized research projects that will provide them with valuable skills in algal identification, databasing, and image processing as well as molecular biology techniques and data analysis. <br/><br/><br/>Freshwater red algae are phylogenetically and morphologically diverse, ranging from single cells to complex multicellular tissue-like thalli.  In recent years, there has been an extensive amount of data generated on the systematics and phylogeny of these organisms resulting in significant taxonomic changes with the proposed new classes, orders, families, genera and species in peer-reviewed publications. A comprehensive book will provide up-to-date taxonomy, identification keys, and photographs of salient features as well as ecology and distribution data. With the clarification of the systematics, biogeographic trends can be assessed more succinctly for genera and species. Compiling physical and chemical data from habitats within a single location will facilitate understanding of taxon distributions, ecological niche space, and potential range changes in the past and into the future.

Why do some species rely heavily on cognitive solutions to life's challenges, whereas others do not? This research will take advantage of the considerable diversity of brain sizes and natural history among birds to investigate these fundamental questions. The researchers will generate a large dataset of within and between species variation in brain size to facilitate this comparative study in cognitive ecology. They will integrate these data with long-term datasets from other fields to investigate whether species with larger (and smaller) than expected brains have unique ecological roles. The project will also examine how different historical and natural history constraints can lead to fundamentally different pathways for brain size evolution. This approach is highly relevant to our own species, given that the conditions that drove the evolution of our exceptionally large brain are currently unclear. Broader impacts include engaging diverse citizens in accessible monthly presentations of this work at the farmer's market in Ferguson, MO. <br/><br/>To increase the depth and breadth of the current sample of avian brain size estimates, data collection efforts will target North American songbirds. This group exhibits considerable variation in relative brain size, ecology and natural history, as well as strong correlations between brain size, behavioral flexibility, and neuron numbers. The North American region offers a wide variety of environmental conditions, well-characterized ecological communities, and a wealth of high-quality time-series data on local population dynamics, ecology and phenology. The researchers will evaluate how brain size relates to the breadth, mean overlap, and position of abiotic ecological niches, measured as the volume that a species occupies in multi-dimensional climate space. To investigate the possibility of alternative pathways for brain size evolution, the researchers will evaluate the extent to which species with small relative brain sizes in variable habitats differ in diet, size and reproductive output from those with relatively large brains. Data sharing will be achieved by developing and hosting an online repository that will provide free and unrestricted access to all available avian brain size data (and their associated metadata). This web page will also provide a mechanism for obtaining and vetting new data from community contributors from around the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What is the genetic basis of plant tolerance to climate variation? Addressing these questions is critical for foresters and crop scientists seeking to select appropriate varieties for high yield in different climates and assuring the nation's food supply.  The answers are also important for predicting whether threatened plant populations can persist in the face of environmental change, or whether introduced species will become invasive in their new range.  Understanding mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is, moreover, a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  The genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (common name: thale cress) provides a unique opportunity to address this problem by synthesizing field measurements, genomic data, and geographic information, as outlined in this project. The results will be valuable to a wide range of scientists, from plant developmental biologists and population geneticists to plant ecologists and foresters.  The project will provide novel interdisciplinary research training for a graduate student, and all of the data will be publicly released to provide a community resource for further analysis and synthesis. <br/><br/>The research project will leverage data from field experiments with A. thaliana in which hundreds of genotypes originating in diverse climates across the native Eurasian range were grown together in common gardens in six sites across Eurasia and North America, along with known mutants in flowering time pathways.  These unique phenotypic data will be integrated with newly available genomic data to investigate the genetic basis and adaptive evolution of complex life history traits such as flowering and phenotypic plasticity (the range of trait values expressed by the same genotype across different environments). The project will have three objectives: 1) Elucidate the genomic basis of complex life history traits and their plasticity in different natural seasonal environments.  2) Estimate natural selection on life history traits to understand how phenotypic plasticity contributes to plant performance in different climates. 3) Combine quantitative genetic and population genomic data to test for a signature of past adaptive divergence and climate adaptation in plastic life history traits. These synthetic analyses will be published in several interrelated scientific papers.  Resulting insights will be further integrated with results of previous research in two major conceptual review papers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project combines 20 years of research in two areas: how genetic material is expressed to build organisms and how mutational changes in DNA sequence lead to changes in specific traits over time. The project combines data from experimental yeast populations measuring the effects of new mutations on gene expression with theory in evolutionary and quantitative genetics. The synthesis of this work will provide a more complete understanding of how differences in gene expression arise and persist over evolutionary time. This synthesis will be presented in a scholarly review paper expected to have a major influence on the field. It will also form the basis of a computational model that will enable new areas of interdisciplinary work. Finally, the importance of mutation as the origin of differences within and between species will be presented to the general public in an interactive museum exhibit developed in collaboration with the University of Michigan's Natural History Museum. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the general rules of life regarding how regulatory variation arises and persists, with potential insights into diverse problems in agriculture, medicine and other areas of societal interest. <br/><br/>Gene expression is controlled by both cis- and trans-regulatory sequences. Variation in both types contributes to expression differences seen within and between species. As for all traits, this variation in gene expression reflects both the introduction of phenotypic variation by mutation (the ""arrival of the fittest"") as well as filtering of this variation by natural selection (the ""survival of the fittest""). This project will take advantage of data produced by the laboratory's systematic study of properties of new regulatory mutations and comparisons with the properties of regulatory variants found in natural populations. These comparisons reveal both what can happen and what has happened in terms of regulatory evolution. More specifically, the relative frequency, effects, dominance, plasticity, gene-by-environment interactions, pleiotropy, and epistasis of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations affecting expression of a focal gene (the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH3 gene) have all been measured empirically. In addition, the fitness effects of changing TDH3 expression have also been determined in multiple environments, and cis- and trans-regulatory variation among strains of S. cerevisiae recently isolated from the wild have been characterized. Synthesizing these data and integrating them with evolutionary theory will result in a more complete picture of the evolutionary process than available for any other quantitative trait.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At least 20% of species have no scientific name and 65% of genera are invalid. This project has 5 main goals: (1) to combine morphological and DNA data to produce a comprehensive evolutionary hypothesis for the subtribe and define genera; (2) to revise the classification for 9 genera containing 159 species (35 to be named), and to name an additional 21+ species in other Euptychiina genera; (3) to train butterfly researchers at the University of Florida and at the University of Campinas, Brazil; (4) to test hypotheses about Euptychiina evolution; (5) and to develop collection and web-based electronic resources to facilitate future research.<br/><br/>The project will provide a reliable classification and understanding of species diversity in Euptychiina and use these to begin to investigate how these organisms diversified and what factors control their current distribution, helping to predict how changing land use and climate are likely to impact their diversity.The project will train 1 post-doctoral researcher, 3 graduate students and other university and high-school students, with special efforts to include minorities. Museum collections will be enhanced and an NSF-funded, web-based informatics platform for storage and rapid sharing of taxonomic data will be adapted for use by the team and for future butterfly researchers. The project website will provide biological data, images and publications, and data will also be available to online biodiversity initiatives such as GBIF, EoL and iDigBio where they will be freely accessible.

Disease impacts on crop yields and livestock put global food supplies at risk and newly emergent diseases that move from animals to humans can threaten human health. But because trade is also one of the main drivers of economic development, it is important that it not be disrupted unnecessarily by measures to protect against disease risk. Striking the right balance is currently difficult to achieve, however, because trade impacts are not systematically incorporated into national and international disease risk assessments. This award supports an interdisciplinary and international team who seek to solve that problem by developing new tools for evaluating the disease risks of world trade. The risk assessment tools produced by the project will provide animal, plant, and human health authorities at national and international levels with the capacity to make improved assessment of the disease risks associated with imports, and of the consequences of alternative trade responses. Improving disease risk management will enhance national security and economic well-being by reducing both disease dispersal and the losses caused by trade interdictions. The project also will strengthen collaborations between US and UK scientists and train graduate students and post-doctoral scientists in research.<br/><br/>The researchers will compile data from multiple secondary sources. Data on plant diseases, livestock and wildlife diseases, disease outbreaks, and global emerging diseases, will be provided by such sources as the National Plant Protection Organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom, the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the UK Food and Environment Research Agency. Public domain databases will provide time series data on trade, including trade volumes, trade values, sanitary and phtyosanitary conditions along trade pathways in exporting and importing countries, as well as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data to estimate national value at risk. These data will be used to parameterize econometric profit maximization risk models to assess the effects of trader decisions and trade networks on the transmission of disease. The models will consider the intervention in trade at three spatial scales (local, national, and global) on incidence of disease transport and effects of altered trade on economic development. The models will be incorporated into a virtual laboratory decision support system to help evaluate alternative incentive-based trade management practices and the effects of decisions on the risk of disease spread."

A strong, single hurricane can convert significant amounts of living forest carbon into dead biomass, and much of that carbon will return to the atmosphere through natural decomposition and soil carbon losses. This acts as a positive feedback to a warming climate. Severe storms also change species composition making the forest vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes. The majority of studies on impacts of hurricanes on ecosystems, however, have been conducted at the plot level and over a limited range of environmental conditions. As a result, our understanding of the factors that impact forest vulnerability to hurricanes and post-storm recovery at the landscape scale is extremely limited. This research will investigate the effects of Hurricane Maria on forested landscapes in Puerto Rico using a combination of a remotely sensed satellite products, data from field plots, and mathematical models. The proposed research will generate data and knowledge essential for the development of forest management practices that are resilient to climate variability and change. Data will be made publicly available and shared with government agencies. One technician, one graduate student, and ten field volunteers will be trained in ecological research. A RAPID response is required to prevent loss of data due to vegetation decomposition and to link remote sensing data to ground observations of damage. Re-growth after storms is swift; the remote sensing signal lasts approximately 1 year following a storm, until post-storm recovery generates new leaf biomass.<br/><br/>Hurricanes represent the dominant natural disturbance in temperate and tropical forests in coastal regions of the North Atlantic. Severe storms also favor recruitment of early successional tree species that are particularly vulnerable to subsequent hurricanes, acting as a positive feedback that exacerbates ecosystem vulnerability. The spatial distribution of wind damage across the landscape depends on storm meteorology, physical landscape heterogeneity, and the attributes of individual trees and aggregate stand structure. Disentangling the contribution of each of these factors to observed damage can be difficult because tree species differ in their vulnerability to storm damage and, at the same time, are distributed in a non-random fashion with respect to landscape factors. Understanding ecosystem vulnerability to severe storms over large spatial extents requires approaches that can tease apart the contributions of landscape and local factors. The proposed research will rely on recent advances in remote sensing tools including optical and hyperspectral images and Light Detection and Ranging to generate novel insights into the landscape and local factors that lead to spatial heterogeneity in storm impacts across broad spatial extents. Investigators will address the following questions: 1) how do landscape characteristics such as topography, slope, aspect, geology, and forest age and fragmentation influence wind damage and biomass loss after a severe hurricane; 2) what is the selective pressure of hurricane damage on forest composition; and (3) how does landscape heterogeneity influence biomass recovery?"

A prominent example is that of birds. Taking to the air enabled the dinosaurian ancestors of birds to exploit a range of ecological niches that now underlie the remarkable modern diversity of the group (approximately 10,000 living species). A significant part of this evolutionary success may have stemmed from the development of a relatively large brain, which has been considered necessary for coordinating the various, nuanced components of powered flight. This study complements the NSF BRAIN initiative by using a cross-disciplinary approach to understand the complex neurological evolution of birds and their dinosaurian relatives. To that end, an array of new techniques and new applications of existing technologies are employed to document the major changes in the brain associated with the origin of powered flight. This study also will establish a model of brain expansion complementing that already available for mammals. The outcome will be an unprecedented database of avian brain anatomy that includes not only imagery of morphological systems but also their relation to data generated through brain function. <br/><br/>The relationship between neuroanatomical, cognitive and behavioral evolution remains poorly understood, especially in deep time and across the vertebrate tree of life. This study addresses this relationship using a cross-disciplinary investigation of the evolutionary link between the large brain of living birds and the morphological changes that mark the transition from cursorial (running) dinosaur to flying bird. Initial steps use innovative imaging methods and novel staining techniques to generate the first data on what areas of the brain birds use while flying, and how this activity differs from that of other behaviors. These data will serve as a framework for a broad analysis of encephalization (increasing head size) within living birds and along the lineage where avian flight originated. Shared landmarks will be used to subdivide the endocranial cavity into functionally relevant partitions that allow testing for volumetric size changes between individual neural structures, including those most active during flight. This study also will use geometric morphometrics (anatomical comparisons) to assess covariation between neuroanatomical partitions and thus the presence of functionally and/or evolutionarily integrated regions of the brain. In short, the proposed study will generate data on how birds use their brain and apply those data to better understand the ancient relationship between brain evolution and the origin of the highly derived avian body plan."

Natural systems, like streams, can provide a buffer to lessen storm impacts and quicken recovery of natural processes that benefit humans.  This research aims to understand how streams along the Gulf Coast of Texas responded to flooding and strong winds after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in August 2017.  The enormous amount of rainfall and associated storm surges are likely to change the number and kinds of organisms that live in nearby streams.  Although the 'community' of microbes, plants and animals in streams is expected to change, it is also expected to recover over time to pre-storm conditions.  The time to recovery is thought to differ in predictable ways between streams and between kinds of organisms.  To test this idea, it is necessary to have data on stream flows, physical stream characteristics, and community composition before and after the storm.  Researchers supported by this award developed and implemented a stream monitoring program prior to Harvey's landfall in south Texas.  This award will allow the researchers to collect data immediately after the storm and over the expected recovery period.  They will explore if the recovery period depends on whether a stream occurs in a typically wet or typically dry area. Results of this project will help urban planners and natural resource managers understand responses of streams to hurricanes.  In addition, the research will directly support faculty to train a diverse group of local scientists and managers who can help their communities respond effectively to future hurricanes.  <br/><br/>This project addresses how climate regime mediates community response to disturbance. Specifically, it tests predictions about which biotic communities and associated ecosystem processes are most or least resilient to climate-related disturbances.  These predictions provide an important test of disturbance theory and are of great relevance to forecasting the ecological impacts of climate variation. A major disturbance event, Hurricane Harvey, affected a region with a sharp climate gradient from semi-arid to sub-humid. The research team, including faculty and students at a Hispanic-serving institution, will use a series of stream ecosystems along the climate gradient, with pre-storm community and ecosystem data, as a model system. In each stream, the research team will conduct high frequency repeated surveys of communities (e.g., microbial, invertebrates), ecosystem components (nutrients, benthic algae, organic matter, habitat), and collect continuous high-frequency data using automated loggers (DO, light, temperature, discharge, depth). These data will track temporal changes in community composition, basal resources, and ecosystem processes that collectively provide measurement of the immediate response and longer-term impacts of the disturbance. It is expected that community resistance to the disturbance will be higher in drier systems with greater stochasticity in abiotic conditions.  Likewise, it is expected that communities with higher annual precipitation and more riparian vegetation will experience a positive response driven by organic matter inputs and increased light and primary production. These general functional responses will vary in rate among trophic groups as a function of generation time."

The sunflower family contains more than 25,000 species, representing 10% of all flowering plants on Earth today. Species within the sunflower family are important agricultural crops including sunflower, lettuce, safflower, artichoke, and chicory.

This research will provide transformative information that may be applicable to other large, diverse lineages of organisms especially when strong discordance amongst gene tree and species tree methods is reported and where large-scale or whole genome duplications are found. The data will shed light on the influence of duplications on both lineage diversity and potential causes of discordance and provide a first step toward understanding evolutionary relationships in the face of large amounts of gene duplication."

This has led to the development of a new field in biology called population genomics. This field examines the processes of genetic evolution in natural populations of many living things at a remarkably fine scale, scanning across the genome - the entire collection of genetic information for each individual studied. Population genomics promises remarkable insights into population dynamics, adaptation, the genetics of important traits, and other areas of biology. However, researchers lack adequate tools for analyzing the rapidly growing amount of data, limiting the insights that they are able to draw. This project addresses this gap with an experimental approach to population genomics, using laboratory populations of yeast, and by developing sophisticated new analytical tools for population genomic data. The experimental approach provides a controlled setting for testing hypotheses about how evolution and adaptation affect variation across the genome, and it produces data to evaluate the performance of new analytical tools. These analytical tools will be disseminated to the scientific community, which will improve the ability of biologists to test and predict responses of populations to environmental change, gene flow, and evolution. Undergraduates, graduate students, and a post-doctoral scholar will be trained, and the research team will participate in outreach and training efforts to facilitate the use of these new tools in the population genomics community.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the scenario of populations under divergent selection with or without gene flow, using replicate laboratory populations of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Populations will be grown under various levels of selection, migration, and recombination, and subjected to high-throughput sequencing to assess the impact of these factors on genetic differentiation at two scales: (1) the chromosomal region around single loci under divergent selection, and (2) the entire genome, under polygenic adaptation and divergence. The project will also develop novel analytical tools, based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), to determine which statistics calculated from population genomic data are most informative about underlying evolutionary processes, and to infer evolutionary parameters under complex models of divergent selection. The experimental data from yeast will provide test cases for the novel ABC-based methods, when the important factors, such as migration and selection, are known and experimentally controlled."

A mass extinction event is currently underway that is many magnitudes greater than previous events recorded in the fossil record. Humanity is widely considered to be in a new period coined the Anthropocene Epoch on account of both extinction rates and the footprints our societies are recording on Earth?s surface. It is not surprising then that species numbers and biodiversity patterns are becoming increasingly relevant to human survival and a rising priority across the world. Biodiversity provides humanity with food, energy, and materials. The biodiversity of plant species can be measured on the ground using calculations such as the total number of species in an area, or the number of species weighted by the portion of area covered by each species. Global biodiversity trends can be collected from satellites but finer scale processes cannot be studied without an expanded network of ground and airborne observations of the same species over short-term intervals (every 1 to 5 years). Remotely sensed and ground based measurements from the National Ecological ObservatoryNetwork are well suited to complete this knowledge gap. This award will combine measurements collected simultaneously from the ground and the Network's Aerial Observation Platform, which has cutting edge optical imaging and three dimensional laser scanning systems onboard, to test the direct mapping of biodiversity variables. A method for measuring biodiversity will be demonstrated at eight Network sites located along a latitudinal gradient in eastern US temperate, broadleaf and mixed forest. Project activities will be conducted over two years at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution. Two workshops will be hosted that are designed to involve faculty and students across a network of Primarily Undergraduate Institutions through collaboration with Ecological Research as Education Network participants. Curriculum will be developed that focus on interdisciplinary training of students in field data analysis training, large dataset handling, macroecology theory and remote sensing. Value added remote sensing map products, educational material and the biodiversity processing framework generated from this project will be made available to National Ecological ObservatoryNetwork data users for testing other sites located in additional eco-climatic domains across the Continental US.<br/><br/>Documenting and understanding patterns of biodiversity is a central issue in macroecology. To date, continental to global scale plant diversity mapping has been based on occurrence data, biased by uneven sampling and narrowly focused only on species richness. Vegetation diversity or phytodiversity occurs along a range of temporal, biological, and spatial scales, from genes to species, ecosystems and global biodiversity. Patches or corridors of biodiversity across a local landscape can reflect areas where fine scale patterns of species diversity are mechanistically related to broad scale dynamics as represented by environmental variables. The first component of this project explores an emerging concept in imaging spectroscopy where spatial patterns of reflectance correlate with species diversity (the spectral variation hypothesis). The second component of this project addresses cross-scale interactions and will directly benefit macrosystems biology by enhancing theory on scaling challenges related to spatial heterogeneity and interactions between fine scale species diversity and broader environmental variables across macroscale gradients such as latitude and time since glaciation. The project investigates the following three questions: 1) what are the spatial and spectral detection limits for species diversity mapping with Network Aerial Observation Platform datasets and by extension, how limited is simple species diversity upscaling, 2) what coarser scale natural and human variables are driving species diversity patterns at the site level and where are local diversity hotspots predicted to occur, and 3) how do patterns of and controls on species diversity change along macroscale gradients and how is spatial heterogeneity expected to influence macrosystem mapping and modeling? The value added optical and structural diversity map products that are generated under this award will be useful to larger remote sensing and ecology communities and help provide a basis for new and synoptic exploration of relationships between functional and taxonomic diversity in the US. The optical diversity products can also be used to run simulations that evaluate the role of future satellite-based spectroscopy missions in mapping Essential Biodiversity Variables. Overall processing flows developed through this project will create new methods for identifying potential landscape and genetic diversity hotspots and results can be used to test global biodiversity theories related to latitudinal and elevational distributions."

This project will result in broadly accessible resources that lift barriers to future research on these insects, including: a phylogeny based on molecular and anatomical data, a revised higher-level classification, images of specimens, data for tens of thousands of specimens, species-level monographs for agriculturally-relevant groups, and robust tools that use molecular and anatomical data for identification of species. <br/><br/>The project will also test a novel approach for describing species. This new method increases the openness and accessibility of biodiversity data and allows one to do analyses of color, texture, shape, and other phenotypes in order to look for ecological patterns and to assist in diagnosing species. The approach is broadly applicable and stands to connect data from taxonomic treatments of any organism, a first for taxonomy. A workshop in contemporary morphology methods will facilitate training and dissemination of this new approach. Two graduate students will be trained as integrative systematists and experts of Ceraphronoidea, the first in over a decade."

In northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere, they dominate wetlands and form extensive peatlands that harbor a broad diversity of microbes, other plants, and animals.  Because of the build-up of peat (partially decomposed plant material), these peatlands have profound impacts on regional patterns of water movement, and the global cycling of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane.  It is estimated that almost one third of the earth's soil carbon is bound up in peatlands even though these habitats account for only about 10% of the land surface area. The goals of this research are to use peatmosses as a model to better understand the connections between DNA sequence variation, plant traits, and ecological function. This research provides a unique opportunity to connect gene composition and variation to the plant traits encoded by those genes, and investigate how these plant traits affect ecosystem function. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be trained in diverse genomic, evolutionary, computational, and ecological methods and analysis, including laboratory exchanges among the collaborating institutions.  Results will be disseminated broadly to the public via field courses and an illustrated publically accessible, online database about peatmosses. <br/><br/>This research integrates broad-level phylogenetics, common garden experiments of a widely-distributed Sphagnum species, and genus-wide comparative genomic studies to understand how adaptive processes occurring within species scale up to and explain diversification of the genus on a worldwide scale.

These data will then be used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among species and assess genus-wide genomic variation.  Analyses of these data will then test for correlations among phylogenetic patterns, distributional range, ecological breadth, and variation in ecologically important phenotypic traits. Plants of Sphagnum magellanicum, which occurs from arctic to tropical regions, will be collected across a latitudinal gradient and grown under experimental conditions to assess photosynthetic responses to environmental factors including day length and temperature, and population differentiation in physiological response.  Gene expression responses in experimental plants will be measured using RNA sequencing to better understand the genetic basis of local physiological adaptation. Whole genome DNA sequences of different S. magellanicum populations will be assembled to assess variation in gene content within a single species (Pan genome structure).  Comparing these population-level data with whole genome sequence data from species spanning the Sphagnum genus will identify how many of these genes are shared with other peatmoss species.  One specific prediction these data will be used to test is whether inducible physiological responses in tropical plants of a widespread species have become fixed and constitutive in tropical Sphagnum species."

However, scientists do not yet understand the rules that govern gut microbiome changes (such as how gut microbiomes change over time), or whether these rules are the same or different in different individuals. The goal of this project is to discover if gut microbiome dynamics are ""universal"" - that is, the same across hosts - or if these microbial changes are host-specific, such that each host's microbiome follows its own rules. Discovering whether each host's microbiome follows its own rules is relevant to human and animal health. If microbiome dynamics are universal, scientists can use these rules to design microbiome therapies that work the same way in different individuals. On the other hand, if these microbes are unique to each individual, then interventions to improve human or animal health must be designed separately for each individual. The work has benefits to broadening participation in STEM education through training in the investigators' labs and an educational outreach project with a public high school in Indiana.  In addition, the researchers will make all statistical methods and code available online for use by other microbiome researchers and microbial ecologists.<br/><br/>Scientists are currently unable to test if gut microbiome dynamics are universal because they lack both the data and the statistical methods to analyze the data. This project overcomes these problems in two ways. First, it will develop new statistical theory and methods to jointly model multiple, highly multidimensional data sets such as those for microbiomes. Second, it will leverage an exceptional, longitudinal microbiome dataset, consisting of over 20,000 16S rRNA gene sequencing profiles on gut microbiome composition, generated for more than 500 wild baboons over a 15-year span. To these microbial composition data, this project will add data on the longitudinal, functional genetic dynamics of the gut microbiome via metagenomic sequencing. The baboons have been the subject of continuous, individual-based studies of baboon behavior and ecology for 47 years. As a result, this project has information on all of the covariates necessary to understand gut microbial dynamics, including the baboons' diets, abiotic environments, social interactions, and composition of the microbial communities themselves. The results of this project will be directly applicable to applied research on mammalian gut microbiomes aimed at improving gut microbiome function to improve host health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshops will catalyze conversations and build collaborations that will strengthen and broaden the practice of monography. Invitations to participate in the workshops will be posted on the websites of professional societies with systematic biologist members, and participants will be selected with the goal of achieving breadth in expertise, career stage, gender and ethnic diversity.  Products resulting from the workshops will be broadly and freely disseminated via scientific publications and websites.<br/><br/>These workshops aim to realize the potential for taxonomic monographs to become central hubs that link and synthesize biodiversity information, with improved access to detailed phenotypic and geographic data, more dynamic, nuanced, and integrated taxonomies, and fully explicit, accessible, and testable hypotheses about organisms, their attributes, and their diversification. In addition to stimulating interactions among systematists who conduct monographic studies in diverse taxonomic groups and among systematists who work on questions that are or could be integrated into monographs, these workshops will engage the community of database scientists, computational biologist, software developers, and others to find novel solutions to the challenges of data access and integration.  The workshops will culminate in a synthesis and consolidation of the ideas developed in the preceding workshops, aimed at building prototypes of tools, workflows, and structures that can be tested and improved by the broader community of systematic biologists. The technological and conceptual developments that will be integrated into monography will make the data of monographs more accessible and impactful across fields, and the interdisciplinarity that will be fostered by engaging database scientists, computational scientists, and software developers will support long-term and innovative solutions that capitalize on the integrative and comprehensive perspectives of taxonomic monographs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some species have very specialized diets that consist of only one or a few items, while other species appear to eat a broad range of food items. Why some animals have highly specialized diets and how species adapt to new food items remain unanswered questions in the field of biology. This project will use frogs as a study system to understand how and why animals become specialized on different food resources. To do so, it will develop new applications of DNA sequencing to generate data on diet and new methods for analyzing complex datasets. The new methods will be broadly applicable to any system beyond just frogs and the resultant data can provide insight into other major biodiversity questions, such as why there are more species in the tropics compared to temperate areas. This project will develop international partnerships, provide research training to undergraduate students at the University of Michigan, generate large quantities of publicly accessible data for future scientific research, and produce basic natural history data that can be used to inform conservation strategies for endangered frog species.<br/><br/><br/>This research project will integrate methods from phylogenetic community ecology and macroevolution to answer questions about the evolution of diet and how trophic ecology correlates with diversification. It will utilize high-throughput sequencing to analyze stomach contents of frogs from sites across the New World. This work will generate a dataset of prey items identified to species level with information about the relative abundance of each in a frog's diet. The proposed research will use the mitochondrial genomes of the prey items to construct a phylogenetic tree of the prey to pair with a phylogeny of frogs that will be estimated with genomic data. With these two trees, measures of diet breadth and overlap that reflect the phylogenetic variability in the diet and the relative abundance of each prey type will be calculated and used to infer rates of species diversification and trophic evolution. These metrics and estimated rates will then be used to examine phylogenetic conservatism in frog diet, the effect of dietary specialization on speciation, and the correlation between rates of trophic evolution and diversification rates."

The genetic consequences of this dynamic population fragmentation has been studied in theory, but experimental studies have lagged behind because of the large quantity of long-term data that are required. The proposed research will close this gap using nearly three decades of data collected from hundreds of populations of a plant (white campion) and an associated disease (anther smut). With these data, we will be able to follow the genetics of local populations as they are born, exchange migrants, and possibly go extinct. These observations are important for understanding how genetics affects extinction and colonization success. More broadly, understanding the dynamics of interconnected populations is fundamental to predicting how disease outbreaks can occur from local patches, how invasive species spread, or how the genetics of species can be altered when they are rare or occur in fragmented habitats. <br/><br/>The major objective of the proposed research is to follow the process of extinction and colonization in interconnected populations and study how these processes create and destroy genetic diversity. This proposal builds on a now 28-year study of the numerical dynamics of Silene latifolia (white campion) and its pathogen Microbotryum violaceum (anther smut). This project uses a long-term population genetic approach to characterize numerous colonization and extinction events and to follow populations through time. Methods used will include long-term monitoring (eventually more than over 800 populations for >30 yrs) and continued genetic sampling (eventually >15yrs). High throughput genomic studies of Silene populations will provide unprecedented resolution of changes in genetic divergence, the parentage of newly established populations, gene flow during population expansion or contraction, the genetic consequences of seed banks and the importance of inbreeding and genetic rescue for population persistence. Also, broad demographic shifts have occurred during the course of this study, opening up the potential to explore the population genetics of non-equilibrium systems of both the host plant and the disease. The Silene/Microbotryum system has become a model for numerous labs, and this research will provide a publicly available long-term data set of demographic and genomic data, living collections, and DNA samples. This study will provide scientific training in timely important fields of ecology, genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology."

When it started, the Baltimore LTER project was highly unusual because most ecologists were working in more natural environments. This was one of the very first urban ecology sites. A long-term approach was needed for urban ecology because changes happen slowly and important events can be rare in urban ecosystems. The team of scientists made many ground-breaking discoveries about nature in cities. They figured out the basics of how an urban ecosystem works.  For example, they discovered how nutrients such as nitrogen flow through steams and are affected by lawns. They also studied plants, mosquitoes and birds. Results of these studies remain important for improving environmental quality in cities and for helping reduce the global impact of human activities. The latter is especially important because most humans live in cities.  LTER scientists have worked closely with teachers and students in Baltimore to share their findings and engage a new generation in ecological discoveries.  This proposal provides support for the final three years of the Baltimore LTER project. <br/><br/>Research at the Baltimore LTER site has focused on natural exogenous drivers, interacting with urban ecosystem structure to influence function. Exogenous drivers include climate, species introductions, and economy; urban ecosystem structure includes physical, biological, social, and built components; and response functions include watershed biogeochemistry, the composition of ecological communities, and human environmental decision making. This framework was used to address questions about sources and sinks of water and nutrients in urban watersheds, ecological communities and their capacity to change over time, and environmental perceptions and behaviors of households and organizations over the long term. During this final phase of the Baltimore LTER project, the following activities will take place: 1) processing and analysis of final samples, with limited new data collection; 2) ensuring data availability in perpetuity; 3) analyzing and synthesizing data; 4) preparing publications that use and present BES datasets; 5) developing a stable and static website that describes the 20 year history of the project and provides links to data, publications and other resources; and 6) decommissioning of long-term field sites in Baltimore.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The utility of genomic resources, however, is limited without knowledge of the complex developmental, physiological, morphological and behavioral traits that genes code for. Indeed, improving the ability to predict important traits (e.g., lifespan, disease) from knowledge of genotypes is one of the top priorities of modern biology. Much research uses the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to map phenotypes onto genotypes. This project will begin by characterizing a set of traits that capture core aspects of life history for ~250 related species of Drosophila. These analyses will be complemented by mapping genotype-phenotype relationships across the 30 species of Drosophila with fully-sequenced genomes.  All data will be made available through a public database. This resource will enable strategic decisions about future genome sequencing priorities. Furthermore, the database will assist the integrated study of diverse life history traits in the context of both resource ecology and phylogeny. <br/><br/>Using standardized protocols, all ~250 species of Drosophila and related genera (Samoaia, Scaptomyza, Zaprionus and Gitona) maintained by the Drosophila Species Stock Center will be phenotyped for a set of 18 morphological, behavioral, physiological and developmental traits, Collectively, these traits capture core aspects of sexual selection and life-history syndromes, in addition to providing characters relevant to ecological selection. These data form the basis for a valuable public database on Drosophila ""evolutionary phenomics,"" along with accompanying phylogenetic resources. The data will also be used for two kinds of state-of-the-art comparative analyses. First, Bayesian phylogenetic modeling, applied to data for all species, will be used to evaluate rates of diversification and co-evolutionary dynamics among character states and across the clade using a range of alternative trait diversification models. Second, two complementary analytical approaches will be applied to all Drosophila species with fully-sequenced genomes to explore genotype-phenotype relationships for all traits, with the goals of identifying candidate genes underlying trait diversification and setting the stage for studies of the molecular evolution and genomic architecture of Drosophila biodiversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A unique long-term experiment will advance general understanding of the resilience of natural communities to ecological perturbations of different sizes, the extent to which ecological transitions are reversible when environmental conditions are restored, and the predictability of ecological communities when perturbed.  The research team includes a high school teacher from Maine who has a long association with this project.

Primary data, panoramic photographs of the experimental plots, and educational activities will be available electronically, and the investigators will post a YouTube video on data archiving and management. <br/><br/>The researchers will test hypotheses that (1) switches between alternative community states of mussel beds and rockweed stands occur in response to infrequent, large-scale occurrences of ice scour during winter, (2) the community that becomes established in large clearings made by ice scour is not predictable, (3) the order of species arrival during re-establishment drives community development and (4) the alternative communities are stable. These hypotheses will be tested using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design consisting of experimental clearings of different sizes, uncleared controls that were created in 1996-97, and half of these controls that were cleared again in 2010-11. In addition to collecting data characterizing patterns of succession in these developing communities, the researchers will assay rates of predation on mussels, mortality rates of mussels in patches of different sizes, and recruitment of juveniles of four key species annually. Analyses of data will compare outcomes from the first run of the experiment (1997-2008) with those from the second run (2011-2021) to test if community development is predictable.

Much variation in body form and habit can be explained by adaptation to the habitats where these fishes live. But the effects of ecological habitat on processes leading to diversification over evolutionary time remain poorly explored. This project will focus on two groups of closely related species that harbor a huge diversity of benthic and pelagic forms (about 2000 species) to disentangle the effects of habitat transitions on rates of speciation and extinction. Understanding the factors that promote diversification in form and habit is important for the long-term conservation of marine biodiversity. Innovative image data analysis necessary to synthesize morphological variation among these fishes also will be applied to develop a fish species identification app for smartphones (FishSnap) that will be freely available to the public, expandable in the future to include all fishes.

The researchers will collect and compare a genome-scale DNA sequence data set of protein-coding genes to infer a phylogenetic tree for about 800 species of these two groups. This tree will be time-calibrated on the basis of carefully selected fossil data to provide a dated evolutionary framework for comparative studies.

Currently, such models assume the rate at which dead wood decomposes is primarily a function of the temperature, tree type and available moisture. Recent evidence suggests that wood-consuming decomposer organisms may be nearly as important in determining the rate of wood decay as these environmental factors. Bark beetle infestations in forests generate massive amounts of dead wood during outbreaks.  During bark beetle epidemics, termites create biological hotspots in and around the dead trees in which they feed.  This, in turn, influences the abundance and diversity of subsequent decomposer organisms.  Preliminary findings from a forest in in the Southeastern USA indicate that fungi carried to trees by bark beetles increase the rate at which termites consume wood containing these fungi. This EAGER project will use intense field studies to determine whether the interaction between bark beetles, fungi and termites is widespread in other forests in North and South America.  This discovery may help solve a critical need to understand why dead wood in forests often decomposes at more variable rates than expected based on temperature. The project will include training opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  As part of the project, a permanent termite display will be constructed at the Mississippi Entomological Museum, and project findings will be disseminated via a popular social media webpage.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to experimentally quantify the importance of this newly-discovered fungus-mediated interaction between bark beetles and subterranean termites on wood decomposition rates in a wide array of coniferous forests (tropical, subtropical, and arid) that contain ongoing bark beetle epidemics and three distinct levels of subterranean termite abundance and diversity. Three field sites will be established, each with an experiment that manipulates presence/absence of the fungus and subsequently quantifies differences in composition of the decomposer communities and rate of wood decay. Meteorological data (temperature, precipitation), termite and other woodboring insect abundance and diversity, fungal community data, wood and soil heterotrophic respiration data, and wood decomposition data we be collected at each site. In this way, this study will determine the relative importance of this biological interaction in mediating wood decomposition across a variety of climactic zones. Ecosystem processes such as decomposition are currently treated as a black box in models, with little focus on interactions among decomposers. The recently discovered link between two ecosystem engineers (bark beetles and termites) may be a significant driver of carbon fluxes in many forest ecosystems, and therefore may have significant impact on the future conceptual frameworks employed to quantify and model wood decomposition rates."

This project will be incorporated into a seminar series at LSU focused on increasing awareness of computational biology among undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Phylogenetic trees are now routinely inferred from enormous genome-scale data sets, revealing extensive variation in apparent phylogenetic signal across loci. However, no general tools currently exist to objectively and quantitatively assess how much of this variation is due to biological processes and how much is caused by methodological error. Distinguishing between true variation and error is the problem to be studied in this project, as resolving this issue is essential for robustly resolving the Tree of Life and for understanding genomic evolution.  The goal of this work is to give researchers the tools to identify and avoid situations where phylogenetic inferences are unreliable. These tools will be implemented in open-source software (RevBayes and R), and will be easily extensible to many types of phylogenetic inference beyond those in this project.  This research will implement suites of existing, alternative statistical approaches employing Bayesian posterior prediction to rigorously assess absolute fit of phylogenetic models to evolutionary data, and how this fit impacts the reliability of inference. Simulations comparing performance of alternative models will focus on three types of inferences: (i) estimation of individual gene trees, (ii) estimation of species trees from many genes, and (iii) comparative analysis of continuous traits. These approaches will be applied to exemplar empirical questions, including the placement of turtles among amniotes using several recently published genome-scale data sets. These data contain surprising and massive heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal regarding the placement of turtles, and thus form an excellent case study."

A key step toward understanding how natural systems function is answering two questions: 1) Why are some communities more sensitive to disturbance than others? and 2) Can the sensitivity of a community be predicted based on its location in a landscape? This study seeks to understand how communities develop and are maintained in rivers. Specifically, the project will explore how sensitivity of river communities is affected by environmental features that dictate how organisms move about the landscape. Examples of these environmental features include prevailing wind currents, connections between forest fragments, and the shape of a river and the small streams feeding the river (i.e. river network) in a watershed. This project uses stream invertebrates in river networks as a model system. The work involves three major tasks: 1) To analyze how the shape of a river network affect the level of variability of stream invertebrate communities using existing data. 2) To experimentally test how the structure of river networks affects the response of invertebrate communities to disturbances. This task will be accomplished using experimental streams, experimentally inducing a disturbance, and following the response. 3) To produce a computer model to explore scenarios considering different shapes of networks, different types of organisms and novel disturbances that cannot be explored using existing data or experiments. This work will directly inform scientists and managers about the responses of river systems to disturbance. The study will also create a tool for exploration of networks in new river systems. This study will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in ecology and mathematical modeling.<br/><br/>Linking community stability to spatial processes in variable environments is one of ecology?s remaining great challenges, with implications for the management and conservation of biodiversity. The researchers focus on controls over invertebrate community stability in riverine ecosystems because they have found that a site location in a dendritic stream network can influence both local biodiversity and temporal stability. Therefore, this project addresses the general question: How does location of a community within a dispersal network interact with species traits to affect aggregate and compositional community stability? The work will build on existing projects including the ecology of river networks, analysis of community temporal stability, river network modeling, and the interaction between models and field data. The project will employ several techniques to address the question, including a meta-analysis of archived long-term stream monitoring data, field experiments, and mechanistic modeling to achieve an understanding of processes behind observed compositional and aggregate stability while simultaneously providing a general theoretical underpinning that is transferable to other contexts and systems. Ultimately this work will be directed at three specific questions: (1)  Within a dispersal network, how does location affect the temporal stability of communities? (2)  How resilient are communities at different locations within a network? (3) How does local stability and structure of the dispersal network affect stability at the regional scale, i.e., across the entire dispersal network?"

For example, microbes in a human account for 100 times more genes than those of their host; similar results are emerging for virtually all free-living organisms.  Disease is the best studied host-microbe interaction, but microbes inside hosts also are responsible for critical functions such as disease resistance as well as nutrient uptake and defense against herbivores (plants), and digestion and reduced inflammatory responses (animals). Yet, in spite of the tremendous diversity and importance of microbes to free-living organisms, there is no predictive understanding of the factors controlling within-host microbial community composition or the spatial scales at which environmental changes affect host and microbial community interactions and functions. Even as human activities lead to increased nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and increased rates of species invasions and extinctions, impacting biological systems at scales ranging from individuals to continents, we know little of the effects of these changes on microbial communities within hosts. This award will provide the first systematic understanding of the responses of plant microbial communities to these pervasive environmental changes on a global scale and provide critically important information on the potential role of microbes in plant productivity, knowledge necessary for feeding a growing human population (9 billion by 2050). This award provides funds to use experiments of unprecedented scale to examine the environmental factors controlling a plant host's fungal, bacterial, and viral microbes at scales ranging from individual plants to regional and global bioclimatic and soil gradients. Using quantitative models to examine multi-scale empirical data, the project team's work will answer three questions. 1) What factors most strongly control microbial communities within hosts across global, continental, regional, and local scales?  2) How does the within-host microbial community affect host reproduction and susceptibility to disease-causing microbes? And 3) how do the symbiotic microbial communities within a host affect the growth, competitive ability, and successful transmission of microbes? The research will encompass replicated experiments in 30 grasslands spanning six continents, representing globally-relevant variation in soil nutrients.  Concurrent collection of data from locally common grass hosts as well as a planted crop host (barley) within experimental nutrient and herbivory treatments will be used to discern the effects of symbiotic microbes on plant host health and to distinguish these from other large-scale factors such as climate and the specific microbes found in each location. High-throughput sequencing will be used to determine variation in within-host microbial communities at scales ranging from meters to continents. Manipulative experiments and data modeling will clarify the effect of microbial communities on host reproduction, resistance to microbial disease, and the spread of microbes and disease. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Grassland communities cover 30% of Earth's ice-free surface, and occur across greatly varying climatic conditions. Grasslands are essential ecosystems that provide food and forage for domesticated and wild animal populations. In this research, grasslands provide an experimental system with which to understand the ecological processes driving microbial community composition and its effects on plant host growth and reproduction. Results of this work have great potential for refining medical and agricultural applications by illuminating the role of microbial communities in the health of their hosts, and the scales at which environment, space, and time most affect host-microbe interactions. Results may identify novel mechanisms of plant resistance to crop pathogens and will contribute significantly to existing microbial sequence databases linked to LTER and NEON sites and priorities. The research group will communicate this work to K-12 children, undergraduates, and the general public via collaborations with Cedar Creek LTER and the Bell Museum of Natural History. All microbial data and living culture collections will be made publicly available, further enhancing research infrastructure and providing a rich resource for further discovery. As always, the project PIs will prioritize involvement of underrepresented groups and disseminate results in peer-reviewed journals."

In a rapidly changing world, there is an urgent need to understand the importance of these processes in species formation and the impact of these processes on how scientists identify and name species. This research program will study genetic, venom protein, and anatomical data to test how natural selection shapes and maintains species, and it will use these results to test several approaches for appropriately identifying species in nature. The researchers will focus on a widespread and medically important group of rattlesnake species (Western Rattlesnakes and their close relatives) as a model system to study species formation. Many previous studies have disagreed about how many species should be recognized within this group of snakes, and different populations can produce diverse symptoms from snake bite due to differences in venom biochemistry. This study will resolve these issues by developing a new system for naming species, provide new insight into the process of species formation, develop new methods for identifying species, and refine the appropriate medical treatment of snakebite in North America. The proposed research includes methodological and theoretical scientific innovation, undergraduate and graduate student training, establishment of collaborative networks, and public outreach. Public outreach will be conducted at the Dallas and Denver Zoos, thereby reaching millions of public visitors per year.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this research program are to understand the interaction of admixture and selection in speciation, and to leverage an empirical system to test how these processes may influence coalescent-based species delimitation methods. This research program will focus on the Western Rattlesnake species group (Crotalus viridis species complex and its sister taxon, C. scutulatus; collectively Cvos hereafter) as a study system. This recently diverged species complex has offered major challenges for systematics, yet provides an ideal model system for studying speciation and species delimitation. This integrated study will combine genomic and phenotypic data to delimit species, inform species delimitation approaches, and provide new genome-scale insight into the process of speciation. This research program will also test hypotheses about the repeatability of patterns selection in the processes of speciation and resistance to gene flow and hybridization. The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) integrate genome-wide sampling and ecological niche modeling to infer population structure and test hypotheses of gene flow among lineages of Cvos; (2) analyze selection in contact zones between putative taxa by integrating niche modeling, genotypic, and phenotypic data to test hypotheses regarding divergence and selection in the speciation process; and (3) develop and test new approaches for delimiting species that more appropriately handle admixture and selection, and apply these methods to test taxonomic hypotheses for the Cvos complex. Successful completion of the project will provide important data to understanding the role of admixture and selection in speciation and vastly improve our analytical methods for delimiting species in the presence of interbreeding across organismal groups. Additionally, an added benefit of the project is the information that will be obtained regarding venom complexity and evolution, which could contribute to better treatment of envenomation from snake bites."

Sequencing will be done on 100 MA lines derived from the Columbia accession of Arabidopsis thaliana, which have been assessed for performance in six natural field environments. Additional sequencing will include 40 lines from each of 8 additional sets of MA lines, established from naturally-collected founder genotypes from France and Sweden, and 50 lines from natural North American selections that have been identified to contain a unique haplotype grouping and divergence pattern of mutations similar to that found in classical MA lines. These data will estimate with much greater accuracy the type and rates of spontaneous mutation at the sequence level and will allow the research team to decompose the spectrum of mutations and connect them to field performance. <br/><br/>The synthesis of these datasets will enable the determination of which types of mutations are more likely to be beneficial, deleterious or neutral, and whether the effects of certain types of identified mutations are consistent across environments.

Scientists have shown that this shared DNA resulted from interbreeding during periods where modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped in time and space. What scientists have not been able to do is determine are the specific times, places and social context of this interbreeding. The human genetic data does not allow us to differentiate brief events from prolonged interbreeding. However, the distinct populations of lice that live on different human populations should remain distinct unless those human populations have prolonged and intimate contact. Therefore, this research will use louse genes to determine when, where, and for what duration these humans were in close contact in the distant past.  The researchers will collect lice from populations in northern Africa, and the Middle East where human introgression with Neanderthals is thought to have first occurred. Genetic data from these lice will be collected and examined to explore patterns of human evolution.

This research investigates how certain complex dental characteristics evolved in the ancestors of modern mammals (therapsids), and thus informs our understanding of the selective forces driving mammalian evolution from their ""reptile-like"" ancestors. Mammal teeth are considered more complex and specialized than reptiles; however, these assumptions have not fully considered extinct species. As such, the evolution of complex dental traits is not entirely understood, which leaves our understanding of the ecology and evolution of ancient mammals incomplete. Histological data and analyses from this work will be made available to the scientific community, and the data will be useful for systematists interested in the evolution of vertebrates. Public outreach through displays and programs at natural history museums will also occur. <br/><br/>The dentition of mammals is unique among living vertebrates, and therapsid fossils have shed light on the evolution of mammalian innovations like a regionalized dentition (heterodonty), multiple tooth roots, and tooth-to-tooth occlusion. While it is relatively straightforward to assess these characters using gross morphology, the evolution of other significant features can only be examined through histological thin sections, and thus remain unknown for many fossil taxa. This research fills this void by using paleohistology and micro-computed tomorgraphy data to determine character states for important dental traits in therapsids. Preliminary data suggest that dental traits once thought exclusive to mammals evolved multiple times in their therapsid forebears. This project also tests for correlative evolution between dental and life history traits along the mammal line as well as in reptilian taxa that have independently evolved these complex traits. The work will provide insight into the selective pressures on the acquisition of mammal innovations."

These data have been used to analyze the genetic basis of species traits in thousands of diverse studies, with a particular focus on understanding traits that are adapted to the local environment. Current statistical methods for analyzing these data, known as genome scans, are limited because they are only designed to detect obvious patterns. However, mathematical models predict that more subtle, yet predictable, patterns will evolve for many traits that are common in nature. However, the genetic basis of these traits may not be detectable by widely used genome-scan methods. There are promising new approaches, however, that may be able to detect these more subtle patterns. This research project aims to ""test the tests:"" to evaluate genome scan methods in a common framework against simulated data. Results will provide new insights into how to implement tests and summarize results so researchers can more effectively study the genetic basis of species traits. Since genome scans have been widely applied in medicine, agriculture, and animal breeding, a better application of these tests can lead to measureable improvements in human lives. To engage persons at different levels of understanding in our research, we will develop a training and outreach program in Genomics, Evolution, Mathematical Modeling and Analysis (GEMMA).<br/><br/>The project will develop a robust framework, grounded in quantitative genetic theory, to guide the creation of a novel set of simulated datasets spanning monogenic to highly polygenic architectures. In phase 1 of the project, researchers will ask how adding realism affects the evolution of genetic architecture and the extent to which populations are adapted to their local environment. Then, they will examine the extent to which the results from univariate and multivariate genome-scan approaches (differentiation outlier tests, association tests, and haplotype-based tests) agree and are accurate. More likely than not, no one method will be ideal for all architectures. Therefore, in phase 2 of the project, researchers will develop approaches for integrating signals from multiple tests to detect outliers in multivariate space, thereby leveraging the unique strengths of different methods. Because this study examines evolutionary processes with a particular focus on the design, implementation, and interpretation of genome scans for polygenic traits, results will allow more accurate characterization of the genetic variation responsible for locally adapted traits."

The Amoebozoa is composed primarily of organisms that have single, amoeboid cells as part of their life cycles. Such cells are dynamic, changing shape as they move with transient extensions of the cell called pseudopodia. These cells are also used for engulfing prey. Amoebae are often thought to be simple because of their apparent lack of obvious characteristics. Consequently many biologists have the impression that these simple looking organisms are 'primitive' and assume that they are very similar to the first eukaryotes. Preliminary data suggest that there is more complexity and diversity in Amoebozoa than is generally acknowledged. This project is designed to find the relationships among amoebozoans and to develop ideas on how these various amoebae originated from an ancestor whose characteristics were reduced. Given that Amoebozoa is the closest lineage to our own, their ancestry and evolution is important to better understand how all eukaryotes evolved.<br/><br/>This research challenges the idea that amoebae are primitively simple. It uses synthetic studies that employ a whole life cycle approach using gene expression profiling and morphological data to address the patterns of broad scale evolution in this highly diverse major eukaryotic lineage. Although amoebozoans occur in nearly every environment, surprisingly little is known about their evolution. This is complicated by the fact that Amoebozoa is under represented in genomic-level databases, and although some recent progress has been made, much more is needed. This project will first develop a robust phylogenetic tree of Amoebozoa under a phylogenomic framework using RNAseq data from taxa broadly sampled across the breadth of the amoebozoan diversity. Additionally, for taxa that display complex life cycles researchers will examine gene expression profiles of various life stages using single cell RNA sequencing techniques. These data will identify commonalties among higher-level amoebozoan groups and by mapping character trait evolution on the tree of Amoebozoa, it will uncover the macroevolutionary trajectories of Amoebozoa. Moreover, this project will examine gene transfer events, gene innovations, gene family expansions and gene losses in Amoebozoa. This represents a unique opportunity to examine the evolution trajectory in which many of the taxa observed today evolved from complex ancestors to more 'simple' terminal taxa. The project will train undergraduate and graduate student training from underrepresented groups in genomics, phylogenetics and Amoebozoa biology."

Box 980568","RICHMOND","VA","232980568","8048286772","BIO","1181","","$0.00","Forests of the United States are primary sources of food, fiber and energy.  They play a fundamental role in the earth's climate system by sequestering in plant biomass carbon that might otherwise form the molecular backbone of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Forests' capacity to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide and build biomass may change substantially with age and disturbance.  Scientists have long theorized a decline in growth and carbon uptake as forests age. New observations, however, suggest that low levels of disturbance, such as those originating from insect pests, fungal pathogens, and extreme weather, in aging forests may, counter-intuitively, sustain or even increase forest carbon sequestration and growth. The mechanisms underlying these higher-than-expected rates of forest carbon sequestration are unknown. This study seeks to identify the mechanisms underpinning forest growth resilience to disturbance, and their thresholds. The researchers will also evaluate if, how, and why different computer simulations, critical to predicting future forest carbon storage and growth and yield, fail to replicate this resilience. Furthermore, they will determine whether evergreen forests in the western United States and deciduous forests in the East, with different prevailing disturbance regimes and climates, follow unique age-forest growth trajectories. The benefits of this project to society, forest and land managers, grade school educators, university students, and forest scientists are far-reaching. By combining biologically-informed field and simulation experiments with a synthesis of North American forests, this study will significantly advance our ecological thinking about forest disturbance, while producing results immediately relevant and accessible to ecosystem and earth system simulations, and to forest managers working to maximize carbon storage, growth, and timber production in increasingly disturbed forest landscapes. The project will produce openly available instructional materials for grade school teachers, train several graduate and undergraduate students, provide open and transparent sources of data and computer code to scientists and land managers, and form a student training partnership between a United States Department of Energy laboratory and an academic institution.<br/><br/>The future terrestrial carbon sink is uncertain as forests of the United States upper Midwest and east broadly advance from early to middle forest succession. With this transition, early successional canopy dominants are senescing and giving way to more biologically and structurally complex forests that are increasingly subject to moderate severity disturbance. Recent studies suggest that net primary production may be sustained in such forests at higher-than-expected rates, but the limits of and mechanisms behind such functional resilience cannot be predicted from present knowledge, which is derived almost entirely from studies of severe, stand-replacing disturbance dynamics in recently disturbed forests. Ecosystem and global models, developed from the same intellectual foundations, also have trouble reproducing the effects of moderate disturbances. The three core research objectives of this work are to: 1) identify mechanisms supporting net primary production resilience to disturbance, and their thresholds; understand if, how, and why different forest models fail to replicate this NPP resilience; and 3) elucidate whether temperate deciduous and coniferous forests, with different disturbance regimes and climates, follow unique age-production trajectories. The project uses a 3-pronged approach of field experiments, model testing, and large-scale data synthesis to transform understanding of how resilient the carbon cycle will be to a range of moderate disturbance intensities in aging forests, elucidating the underlying mechanisms that determine the threshold between net primary production resilience and decline. The field component uses a fully replicated gradient of disturbance severity, from 0 to 85 % defoliation, to systematically determine how and why the carbon cycle shifts in response to rising disturbance levels. The PIs will employ a suite of carbon and nitrogen cycling measurements, focusing on canopy structure, leaf physiology, and canopy nitrogen reallocation, to identify the mechanisms that cause rapid net primary production resilience or decline following disturbance. The modeling component of the project uses data assimilation experiments, running two very different ecophysiological models within an open source, NSF-supported ecoinformatics toolbox, to identify the processes most responsible for the models' hypothesized failure to simulate net primary production resilience to disturbance, and iteratively inform the next field season's sampling priorities. Finally, a data synthesis component uses newly available observations to characterize disturbance effects on age-net ecosystem production trajectories for North American's temperate forests."

The species composition of ecosystems and habitats varies significantly by region and habitat type, and the effects of evolutionary processes can be obscured by contemporary ecological interactions unless confounding factors are carefully considered. The proposed research will address this problem by providing critical context for identifying the roles of ecological and historical processes in community assembly. This effort will bring a unique and unprecedented dataset to bear on central questions in community ecology while contributing to the understanding of sensitive biomes facing increased pressure from climate change and invasive species. The historical perspective introduced by the proposed framework will significantly improve the understanding of plant diversity and patterns of community structure at both local and continental scales, and serve as a model for future studies of community structure.<br/><br/>The proposed research will combine phylogenetic data with NEON data on species occurrence, abundance, and traits to test the relative roles of ecological and historical processes in governing plant community assembly. This includes evaluation of aspects of how established communities either accommodate or resist non-native species. Three specific questions will be addressed, focusing on woody perennials (e.g. trees, shrubs, cactuses, lianas): (1) How have historical processes shaped patterns of community structure? (2) How have species functional traits shaped patterns of community structure? (3) Are communities of closely related species more susceptible to non-native species invasion? Analyses will be conducted using a broad array of ecological and evolutionary comparative and analytical computational methods. For phylogenetic analyses, the PIs will obtain sequence data for all woody perennials recorded within each NEON-sampled plot by first mining the GenBank database for publically available sequences, and will fill in any missing data by generating new sequences using tissue samples obtained from herbarium samples."

Today in the Brazilian Amazon, construction of more than 30 large hydroelectric dams, and approximately 170 smaller dams on tributaries of the Amazon River are underway as a result of long-term governmental plans geared toward increased energy security, economic growth, improved living standards and industrialization. Despite the long history of hydropower development in Brazil, the synergistic, cumulative and long-term effects of dams on rivers, forests, and social systems are still undervalued in planning and decision-making. Uncertainty about the social-ecological effects of dam construction is due in large part to the existing piecemeal approach to analyzing the impacts of dams.  This uncertainty highlights an urgent need for coordinated research. The Amazon Dams Network will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders, including fishermen, indigenous peoples, farmers, scientists, students, and decision-makers to address this need.  Working together, the network will integrate and coordinate research on how dam construction and operations affect people, their livelihoods, and the environment.  Sharing of knowledge, data and technology will occur through workshops, case-study modules, a bilingual website, maps, and published data and papers.  <br/><br/>The goal of the Amazon Dams Network is to advance inter- and trans-disciplinary research coordination, focusing on the transformation of social-ecological systems by hydroelectric dam construction in the Amazon and United States. The geographical focus initially includes the Tocantins, Madeira and Xingu River watersheds in the Amazon and the Colorado River watershed in the US. Network activities will focus on four critical integrative themes: a) governance and social actors (an overarching and cross-cutting theme that mediates interactions and outcomes in dammed systems); b) watershed hydrology and geomorphology; c) fish and fisheries; and d) land-use/land-cover change.  Focal intersections among these themes to be addressed by the network include feedbacks between hydrologic change and forest ecosystems; human geographic dislocations and land-use change; monitoring and mitigation approaches for Brazilian dams; and the relevance of local knowledge (fishermen, indigenous peoples, riparian communities) for the study and management of systems transformed by infrastructure development. The network will enable data discovery and synthesis, sharing of knowledge, and inter- and transdisciplinary and social learning among participants and the public through a series of activities held at research sites in Brazil and the US, the creation of web-based learning and case studies modules, and the archiving of publically available data."

Ubiquitous, diverse, and exclusively predatory, spiders are one the most diverse and fascinating animal groups and the dominant arthropod predators in most terrestrial ecosystems. Orb-weavers are remarkable not only because of the high number of species described so far, but also because of the extraordinary architectural diversity of their foraging webs, ranging from highly geometric snare designs, often regarded as a pinnacle of animal engineering, to sheet and irregular cob webs. Understanding web evolution and diversification requires an empirically robust hypothesis about the underlying genealogical patterns?the spider tree of life. Traditional anatomical and genetic methods have not yet produced a compelling answer to this problem, and thus our understanding of the evolution of this group is far from satisfactory. The researchers of this project will use new methods to gather genetic data to answer this long-standing question. The results of this research will be of interest to many biologists working on any comparative aspects of orb-weavers because it will provide the genomic resources and the fundamental comparative basis for studies on a broad diversity of topics (silk biology, sexual selection, venom evolution, etc.). This project will serve as a training platform for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers.

The scale and pace of changes in land ownership and access has increased rapidly in lower-income tropical countries. The project will assess outcomes of land transactions in Ethiopia - a country that has witnessed thousands of transactions and has substantial external investment, including from the United States - to identify when land transactions generate positive versus negative outcomes. This research will focus in particular on agricultural, ecological, and food and energy security outcomes. The project will generate new data that will be available for public use by other scholars and researchers, train scientists in the United States and build greater research capacity among international collaborators, and produce findings that will hold practical interest for decision makers in government agencies, NGOs, and donor organizations. Generalizable propositions about the impacts of land tenure changes on farm level processes, producer incentives, and labor practices will be of interest to US investors in other regions. <br/><br/>The project will focus in particular on quantifying the nature and extent of socioeconomic, land cover/change and ecological impacts, and modeling the causal sequences and feedback loops of land transactions. The research will advance the conceptual understanding of how tenure and institutional changes on land drive human-nature interactions and impacts in coupled agro-ecological systems. The project will aggregate and leverage existing socioeconomic datasets, and collect original social and ecological data from eight transaction sites. The research will contribute in three major ways towards an improved understanding of the effects of land transactions and the social and ecological effects of land tenure changes. It will: (1) Develop new theoretical insights into the livelihood, land use, and ecological effects of land tenure changes and displacement through integration, quantitative analyses, and agent based modeling based on multi-level social, economic, ecological, and biophysical data; (2) Enhance existing methods to understand and detect changes in land cover using remote sensing data for both agricultural and forest landscapes, particularly for the drier eastern African region; and (3) Improve statistical analysis and computer simulations-based predictions, in particular by developing better spatial analysis techniques. Overall, the project will show how varying patterns of livelihood and land cover changes result from land transition pathways associated with land transactions."

Both of these two closely related bird species live in the highlands of Papua New Guinea; one species occurs at lower elevations, the other occurs at higher elevations. Scientists have long known that tropical mountain ranges, like these in Papua New Guinea, have many more species of plants and animals than expected based on their small total area. However, a fundamental unanswered question is whether random or adaptive evolutionary processes are more important in generating this increased biological diversity. This study will use mathematical models and DNA sequence data collected from field and museum specimens to test alternate explanations for the evolutionary divergence of these two species. Identifying the processes responsible for the evolution of new species is important for understanding the history of life on Earth and for predicting how environmental complexity and change leads to new biological diversity. Results of this work are expected to provide important insights for conservation management of montane bird species. In addition, the project includes creation of public museum displays and other educational outreach activities. <br/><br/>Sister species with differing elevational ranges present a powerful system for understanding the interplay between evolutionary processes and geographic and environmental complexity. This project will explore patterns and drivers of whole genomic differentiation in Syma genus forest kingfishers (Aves: Halcyonidae), a young species pair with parapatric lowland and highland distributions in Papua New Guinea. The researchers will generate single nucleotide polymorphism data and whole genome DNA sequences from samples collected in the field and from natural history museum collections. Using these data they will describe phylogeographic patterns and infer demographic history in both species, estimate phylogenetic relationships and conduct species delimitation, and assess the relative contribution of neutral and adaptive evolutionary processes. In combination, these analyses will provide a test of a hypothesis of ecological speciation in Syma due to disruptive natural selection across an elevational gradient. The research will additionally reveal important clues regarding the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for disproportionate species richness in tropical montane systems."

With the large existing collections at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the availability of most types (original specimens used to describe and name species) in New Zealand museums, this research aims to tackle this fauna and study the evolutionary processes that shaped it at different time-scales and at an unprecedented level. A rigorous estimate of the Opiliones species diversity in New Zealand will be provided by using a combination of next-generation sequence data and cutting edge morphological techniques, serving as an example applicable to other regions of the world. The research will use transcriptomic data from 200 individuals to generate phylogenies of three southern Hemisphere lineages that will allow testing of biogeographic hypotheses related to paleo-endemism and ancient Gondwanan breakup events. Selected genera will then be used to test biogeographic hypotheses related to post-Gondwanan geological history, including Oligocene marine transgressions, Southern Alps orogeny and Last Glacial Maximum refugia, using a RAD-sequencing NGS approach. Finally the research aims to produce taxonomic monographs treating all the species of New Zealand Opiliones while developing new standards for linking biodiversity data, including images, videos, and genomic data, to specimen records through the centralized database MCZbase, publicly available online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many species in nature have multiple color morphs that occur together within a single population. However, the frequencies at which particular morphs occur can vary widely among different populations. A fundamental unanswered question in evolutionary ecology is whether natural selection or dispersal is primarily driving these differences. This study will collect and analyze genomic data from 32 Eastern Red-backed Salamander populations that range from having only a single color morph present to having both morphs present at various frequencies. Different morphs of this species also differ in other aspects of their biology, such as physiology and aggression, and a major goal is to assess the relative importance of local adaptation versus dispersal among populations in maintaining morph frequencies. Results will further our basic understanding of the relationship between color variation and the evolution of diversity. In addition, the project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students, who will be trained in cutting-edge genetic techniques. Outreach includes public seminars at two local nature preserves and educational displays at the local library for school children.<br/><br/>This project will use genomic data to determine whether geographic distance, environmental variables, morph frequency, or a combination of these factors best explain patterns of genetic variation in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus. Genetic data will be collected using double digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD). These data will be used to quantify levels of gene flow in P. cinereus from 480 individuals from 32 populations across northern Ohio that vary in morph frequency, from monomorphic to various degrees of polymorphic. A variety of statistical analyses, such as STRUCTURE, BAYESCAN, and redundancy analysis, will be used to determine if genetic variation in P. cinereus is more closely linked with phenotype frequency or geographic distance. Overall, this study will provide critical information on the relative contributions of morph frequency and geographic distance for explaining patterns of genetic variation in P. cinereus, and will improve our understanding of the factors involved in the evolution and maintenance of color polymorphisms."

Palms are an interesting group of plants from both an evolutionary and environmental perspective. They have a long evolutionary history stretching back at least 90 million years, evidenced by a rich and widespread fossil record, and are useful indicators of past environmental conditions due to the narrow climatic range within which most can survive. By using the fossil record to inform the evolutionary history of palms, this research seeks to understand their geographical range, and how they have responded to changing environments throughout their history. This research will test current hypotheses on palm evolution, and generate publicly available databases of living and fossil palm diversity. One graduate student will be trained in diverse systematics methods, and datasets generated by this research will also be used to train undergraduates from underrepresented groups. Materials from the research will also be used to develop interactive exhibits for teaching about plant structure, diversity, and evolution to the public.<br/><br/>This project investigates the historical biogeography of the palm family by incorporating empirical data from the geologic record into phylogenetic and model-based biogeographic analyses. It will test current hypotheses of a Laurasian origin of the crown node of Arecaceae and of the biogeographic origins of the major subfamilies. This work will also investigate the role of shifting continental geography in the radiation of palms, and how climatic changes correlate with shifts in dispersal and extinction rates over the last 100 million years. A comprehensive database of the palm fossil record will be compiled and the data incorporated into a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model to infer historical ranges of taxa, and a dispersal-extinction-sampling model to compute dispersal and extinction rates over time, which can be correlated with climate data. Fossil fruits with sufficient characters for inclusion in a phylogenetic analysis will be studied using X-ray micro-computed tomography, and will be used to generate a time-calibrated phylogeny for use in the DEC analysis. Outcomes include a comprehensive fossil record database for palms, 3D morphological data on living palms, a tribe-level chronogram for the family, and new insights into the historical biogeography of this important group of plants."

However, no general tools currently exist to objectively and quantitatively assess how much of this variation is due to biological processes and how much is caused by methodological error. Distinguishing between true variation and error is the problem to be studied in this project, as resolving this issue is essential for robustly resolving the Tree of Life and for understanding genomic evolution.  The goal of this work is to give researchers the tools to identify and avoid situations where phylogenetic inferences are unreliable. These tools will be implemented in open-source software (RevBayes and R), and will be easily extensible to many types of phylogenetic inference beyond those in this project.  This research will implement suites of existing, alternative statistical approaches employing Bayesian posterior prediction to rigorously assess absolute fit of phylogenetic models to evolutionary data, and how this fit impacts the reliability of inference. Simulations comparing performance of alternative models will focus on three types of inferences: (i) estimation of individual gene trees, (ii) estimation of species trees from many genes, and (iii) comparative analysis of continuous traits. These approaches will be applied to exemplar empirical questions, including the placement of turtles among amniotes using several recently published genome-scale data sets. These data contain surprising and massive heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal regarding the placement of turtles, and thus form an excellent case study."

Despite the antiquity, notoriety, global distribution, ecological, and medical importance of these ""living fossils"", scorpion classification is contentious and the scorpion tree of life ambiguously resolved, hindering the testing of important hypotheses concerning scorpion evolution, and exploration of the pharmacological potential of scorpion venom. By integrating genomic and morphological data from living and fossil scorpions, this project will provide the most comprehensive analysis of the scorpion tree of life and the evolutionary position of scorpions, to date.

A matrix of morphological observations will be completed for all species in the genomic dataset and representatives of extinct lineages of scorpions and their chelicerate relatives. Additionally, the phylogeny and morphology will be used to present a predictive classification of scorpions above the level of genus and investigate questions concerning the evolution and diversification of scorpions and their venoms. The project will include extensive fieldwork and collaboration with international colleagues and will represent the most comprehensive evolutionary study of any chelicerate group.

If climate is the predominant force structuring communities, climate warming should predictably result in the loss of cold-adapted species at the expense of warm-adapted species in local communities. Alternatively, if regional climate doesn't strongly structure local communities, then species composition may not change much with climate change. However, an apparent lack of change in the species composition of local communities experiencing climate warming can also arise from a limited ability of species to shift their geographic ranges, e.g., slow rate of dispersal. Unfortunately, these two possibilities have very different implications; the first suggests communities may be somewhat resilient to climate change, while the latter implies community sensitivity, especially as climate change accelerates. This research will test the importance of community resilience vs. sensitivity to recent and future climate change, by examining unique historic data sets of plant species composition collected across regional climatic gradients in two Pacific Northwest National Parks.    The project will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of climate change and communicate this information to National Park Service and other resource managers in the Pacific Northwest.

Anolis lizards (anoles) on the Greater Antillean islands in the Caribbean have undergone repeated adaptive evolution, resulting in the formation of different species on different islands that have evolved similar traits for occupying similar parts of the forest habitat.  This is a remarkable case of convergent evolution, in which separate species independently evolve similar traits, and ecological divergence, in which species diversify in response to the environment.  Thus, anoles present opportunities to answer several important questions, including what are the factors that produce diversity in the important ecological traits of a species?  What is the genetic basis for these traits, and are the same genes involved in the repeated evolution of particular traits in different species?  When do the processes generating variation lead to speciation, in which one species diversifies into multiple, distinct species?   This project will examine how spatial variation in the environment leads to variation in adaptive physical traits and variation across the genome both within and between species.  The researchers will use advanced methods in genetic, morphology, and spatial statistics to analyze individual animals from a dozen species of anoles collected across different environments.  By examining multiple species and many individual from each species, the researchers will be able to identify the factors that generate different levels of biodiversity during different stages of adaptive evolution.  This project will also result in the training of two postdoctoral researchers and numerous graduate and undergraduate students, including students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.  The researchers also plan to integrate the results of the project into classroom learning modules on the ecology and evolution of adaptive radiations for K-12 students.<br/><br/>Adaptive radiations, like the replicated diversification of Anolis lizards on the Greater Antilles into ecomorph classes through the evolution of novel traits, present excellent systems in which to study ecological divergence and parallel evolution. The overarching goal of the proposed research will be to examine how spatial environmental variation generates adaptive phenotypic diversity (Functional dimension), population genomic diversity (Genetic dimension), and ecomorphological species diversity (Phylogenetic dimension) in replicated adaptive radiations of Anolis lizards. Specifically, this project will test whether patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation depend upon the spatial structure of the environment or the ecology of the species; whether parallel phenotypic divergence involves parallel genetic divergence; whether environmental variation generates heterogeneous genomic divergence both within and between species; and whether the same regions of the genome are repeatedly involved in generating ecomorphological diversity. These questions will be answered by assembling ultra-high resolution environmental, morphological, and genetic datasets for 12 Anolis species from the Greater Antilles using cutting-edge data collection methods. This project will use terrestrial-LiDAR scans of structural habitats and geospatial analysis of bioclimatic layers in a GIS (Geographical Information System) to generate the environmental data, exon capture and whole exome sequencing to produce the genetic data, and micro-CT scanning to generate 3D reconstructions of field-collected specimens for the morphological data. Innovative analytical approaches will then be used to integrate these diverse datasets to understand the processes underlying diversification across different stages of adaptive radiation."

These birds migrate between breeding sites in Europe and Asia and overwintering sites in Africa. Individual birds will be tested for exposure to avian influenza virus and Newcastle Disease virus, the presence of salmonella bacteria, lice and ticks, and their general state-of-health will be assessed. Many of the animals will be fitted with GPS tags that record the movement and locations of individuals as they migrate, breed, and overwinter over a period of many months to several years. In addition, this study will provide new methods and tools for describing and predicting disease transmission by migrating birds. These tools will be useful both for human and livestock health, as well as for the conservation and management of wildlife. They will be made available to the ecological disease research community and for educational purposes at high school and colleges.<br/><br/>The scientific aim of the study is to advance knowledge of how migration impacts the evolutionary ecology of hosts and pathogens within migratory host populations and also to understand this within a community of multiple species residing in an area ephemerally used by migratory populations. This will be achieved by comparing the serological, immunological and physiological state of resident and migratory subpopulations within Israel with individuals opportunistically sampled in breeding and overwinter grounds, at sites revealed by movement information obtained from GPS and data-logging tags. These individual-health data, high resolution movement data as well as pathogen genomic data, will be analyzed to assess relationships in timing, intensity and spread of diseases within and beyond Israel. Agent-based computational models will be constructed using the Nova modeling platform and used to assess relationships among correlated variables.  In addition, these models will be use to predict responses of disease systems to both land-use practices and global climate change."

The research will focus on rodents due to their high diversity, strong fossil record, well-resolved phylogenies for living and fossil groups, and vital roles in ecosystems as prey species and indicators of environmental change. It will use data from western North America because it contains landscapes of contrasting high and low topographic complexity in the intermontane west and the Great Plains, respectively. The research goals include: reconstructing aspects of landscape history suitable for biogeographic analyses, testing models of origination and extinction of species, and testing for selectivity of ecological traits during changes over time and space in lineages and faunas. Analyses will demonstrate that the integration of neontological, paleontological, and geohistorical data can achieve greater insights than studying modern or historical data alone. Understanding geographic changes in rodent diversity over deep time is also relevant for conservation efforts in montane regions, which provide climatic refugia during periods of global warming."

Most efforts to predict ecological responses to environmental changes only try to predict the future geographical ranges of species, not the actual number of individuals across the range, even though numbers are likely to be a far more important measure of ecological functioning. Among the problems with forecasting either range shifts or changes in numbers is the variability in the environment from year to year, such that short-term responses of species may be very different than long-term trends, necessitating the long-term studies to be carried out in this project. In addition, populations of widespread species often show adaptation to the local environment, so that the range of climatic conditions tolerated by a species as a whole may not reflect the suitable conditions for individuals in any one population. Ignoring local adaptation may lead to inaccurate predictions of both geographical ranges and numbers of individuals. Finally, the scientists leading this project will develop training materials and teach workshops to high school teachers in order to improve students' understanding of the ecological responses to changes in climate and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project is designed to address these and other problems in predicting ecological responses to future environmental conditions, using a long-term data set combined with new experiments. The study focuses on two wide-spread plants that occur in western North America from northernmost Alaska to central New Mexico. Seventeen years of data on the species at sites across this latitudinal range have shown how environmental change can influence survival, growth and reproduction of these plants. In the current project, plants will be transplanted between multiple sites to test for local adaptation to environmental change in the field (evidence from growth chamber experiments suggests the potential for such adaptation). Using these data and those from past and ongoing surveys of natural populations, new models will be developed to predict plant numbers in response to local environmental conditions for populations across the continent. These predictions will then be tested against current distributions and population sizes. After this validation, the local models will be tied to global models to improve predictions of ecological responses to future environmental conditions. The goals of the project are both to better predict how these particular species will respond to changes in their environment and to develop and test methods for making such predictions that can be used for many other species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The drought will dramatically alter which species are present in the ecosystems of the Rockies and their relative abundances. The drought thus presents an unusual opportunity to study how pollination networks (the connections between interacting pollinator and plant species) are affected by disturbances. This is important given that extreme environmental events are expected to become increasingly common and that pollination is critically important for the maintenance of both wild plant populations and the productivity and security of many agricultural crops. Specifically, this project is focused on 1) how species in ecosystems can form new connections to other species after disturbances; 2) how new connections can be predicted even following major disturbance; and 3) the implications of new patterns of plant-pollinator relationships for understanding ecosystem-level responses to disturbance. This work will contribute to better understanding of how networks (including other ecological networks, and other network types such as economic, engineered, and social networks) respond to disturbances, particularly in terms of the formation of new connections.<br/><br/>This project will use existing plant-pollinator network field data from non-drought years (2016 and 2017) to build and test mechanism-focused models of network structure, based on plant and pollinator abundances, competition between pollinators for flowers, and data on plant and pollinator physical traits (such as body size). Model predictions will be compared with field data from the severe drought year (2018) in which it is anticipated that there will be a strong reduction in which species are present (for example, many long-lived plant species may not bloom when drought-stressed) as well as substantial changes in relative abundances of flowers and pollinators. In particular, the project will also assess how well this new network model performs relative to existing alternative models (none of which currently perform well in predicting interactions). The researchers will then use models to assess generally how substantial capacity for re-wiring will affect system-level responses to perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the exact relationship between anaerobic fungi and other fungal groups, as well as the timing and sequence of events that lead to their sequestration into the herbivorous gut remain unclear. Further, it is not exactly known how the retention of anaerobic fungi in the herbivorous gut has affected their genomes and evolution. This project will tackle these questions by sequencing the genomes of a large, diverse collection of anaerobic fungi, and analyzing the data produced using a wide range of computational procedures.

This research will utilize the data generated to conduct an extensive phylogenomic analysis, aiming to resolve their evolutionary history within the fungal tree of life, correlate the timing of AGF diversification events to the evolution of their herbivorous hosts, resolve the diversification pattern of anaerobic fungal genera, and investigate the impact of the unique habitat and evolutionary trajectory on their genomic architecture. The proposed efforts will lead to significant advances in the understanding of the history of this peculiar group of fungi and factors driving their evolution.

In part, this may be because pathogens are usually studied in isolation. An alternative approach is to consider emerging pathogens as members of an ecological community of interacting microbes. The community ecology of viruses co-occurring in hosts -- the virome -- has yet to be explored as an ecological community even though viruses are known to be important emerging disease agents. The research supported by this award will address this deficiency by focusing on the viromes living inside two widespread species that live in close association with humans: the white footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).  Blacklegged ticks feed abundantly on white-footed mice, and the two species freely exchange microbes during the lengthy blood meals.  By exploring how the viromes of these two species are assembled and how they interact and flow between mice and ticks, the proposed research will reveal how viromes shape transmission of existing and potential pathogens. The research will be carried out in the northeast corridor of the United States, an area known to be an excellent location for studying virus emergence and the role played by white-footed mice and blacklegged ticks in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens (those transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans).  White-footed mice and blacklegged ticks serve as reservoir host and vector, respectively, of many emerging diseases of humans, including Lyme disease. Pilot studies have revealed that these same two species also harbor a community of previously undescribed viruses that may emerge as zoonotic diseases in the future. <br/><br/>The researchers take an explicitly ecological approach to understanding viromes of reservoir and vector hosts. The researchers will: (1) characterize the viromes of both mouse and tick; (2) determine patterns of virome assembly throughout the lifetimes of both mouse and tick; (3) determine how virus communities affect the transmission of several important vector borne zoonotic pathogens; (4) identify whether viromes affect differences between individual mice and ticks in their abilities to transmit known and new pathogens; and (5) determine whether viromes and transmission probabilities change along with changing abundance of mice and between suburban/urban and more rural habitats. Data generated by each of these specific aims will be modeled using statistical (machine learning) algorithms, which accommodate diverse data types and apply a model-free analytical approach. By using complex and high-dimensional empirical data describing hosts, vectors, viromes, and their shared natural environments, these algorithms can achieve superior pattern detection  (such as virome composition) and improved ability to make useful predictions (such as what combinations of traits of vector viromes and mammal hosts best predict virus transmission)."

Therefore, investors hedge their bets by investing in multiple stocks simultaneously or dividing investments between stocks and bonds. This reduces the chance of complete loss due to a stock crash but also reduces potential gains when a stock dramatically rises. Similarly, organisms may have evolved bet hedging strategies that allow them to cope with dynamic environments. To date the evidence supporting the existence of biological bet-hedging strategies stems primarily from theoretical work. To robustly assess evidence for bet hedging in nature, this study takes advantage of a fascinating reproductive strategy, termed offspring polymorphism, in which organisms produce multiple different kinds of offspring simultaneously. This strategy can be observed across many life forms including animals (e.g. frogs) and bacteria but is especially common in plants. Investigators will test the hypothesis that seed-polymorphism plants produce one seed or offspring type that is good at surviving in dry years and one that is good at surviving in wet years. This research will help scientists gain a better understanding of how organisms cope with change. This will increase predictive power about organisms' responses to environmental change and increasing desertification. Outreach to the public will occur, and undergraduate students will be trained as part of this work.<br/><br/>Through the combination of an innovative field experiment and stochastic population models parameterized with long-term field and experimental data, the researchers will rigorously evaluate seed polymorphism as a bet hedging strategy in Pectocarya heterocarpa, a winter, desert annual species. P. heterocarpa is particularly suitable as it produces three visually distinct and spatially separated seed types which are easy to distinguish and count. These morphs will be sown in a natural field setting under various rain reducing shelters to examine how seeds differ in their germination timing, growth, and fitness under different rainfall regimes. The ecologists will combine this data with multi-decadal temporal and spatial demographic data on P. heterocarpa. They will then parameterize density-dependent and independent models to rigorously evaluate offspring polymorphism as a bet hedging strategy. Specifically, the density-independent model will allow researchers to find optimal seed ratios under different environmental regimes while the density-dependent models allow for an adaptive dynamics approach to find evolutionary stable seed polymorphism strategies."

The adaptation of microbes is important to understand, because microbes are: a) the primary drivers of global biogeochemical cycles, b) the means of production for many applications in biotechnology, and c) the causes of most infectious diseases. Microbes are frequently moved around by the action of animals, plants, wind and water, and may be deposited in unfavorable habitats. As a consequence, microbes adapt to new environments through to a combination of fast mutation rates and acquisition of new genes directly from their environment. There is a pressing need to better understand these processes by which microbes generate and maintain adaptive genetic variation, because such information is needed to forecast the responses of microbial species to rapid changes in land management or climate. This project studies how adaptive genetic variation permits a common bacteria important in biotechnology and the food supply, Escherichia coli, to survive after deposition in unfavorable habitats. Data on this process can tell us about how adaptive variation in populations contributes to the formation of new species. <br/><br/>This project is designed to use the process of passive dispersal to diverse habitats as a natural experiment in order to differentiate between three models of ecological divergence in microbial populations. Studies of the landscape level structure in microbial populations will be complemented with genome-wide association studies. These experiments will link genomic polymorphisms to variation in phenotype, gene expression regulation, and source environment characteristics.  These analyses will be coupled with laboratory challenges to quantify the adaptive value of genomic polymorphisms. Machine learning analytical techniques will be used to determine which of three models of ecological divergence best explains the data. An education program will teach undergraduate students about the ecological processes contributing to microevolution and speciation in microbes. The program will combine an agent-based model and data from experiments to teach students to interpret genomic adaptations in light of ecological processes acting on microbes in natural environments."

Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.<br/><br/>The researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases."

In the face of climate change and other environmental challenges, society can no longer rely solely on past experience to understand and manage the living world. This award asks the question, ?What would it take to forecast ecological processes the same way we forecast the weather?? This project will development an operational ecological forecasting capability similar to weather forecasting that uses an iterative cycle between making forecasts, performing analyses, and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for building a forecast capacity, and also a crucial part of any decision making under high uncertainty. In addition to making ecology more relevant to management, near-term forecasts routinely compare specific, quantitative predictions to new data, which is one of the strongest tests of any scientific theory. This project will generate near-term forecasts that leverage ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network and spanning a wide range of themes: leaf phenology, land carbon and energy fluxes, tick-borne disease incidence, small-mammal populations, aquatic productivity, and soil microbial diversity and function. This broad, comparative approach will be used to address cross-cutting questions about the nature of predictability in ecology and develop an overarching body of forecasting theory and methods.<br/><br/> The Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI) will advance ecological knowledge at three levels: (1) overarching across-theme hypotheses about the predictability of ecological systems; (2) pressing within-theme questions about what drives process and predictability; and (3) advancing the tools and techniques that will enable an iterative approach to quantitative hypothesis testing. The overarching hypotheses of this project are that: (1) ecological predictability is more driven by processes error than initial condition error; (2) there are consistent patterns in the sources of uncertainty across themes; (3) across themes, spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated; and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated with limits of predictability. Overall, the answers to these questions address to what extent there are general patterns to ecological predictability, which would advance both our basic understanding of ecological processes and constrain the practical problem of making forecasts.<br/><br/>The expected outcomes of NEFI are to: (1) Disseminate data products and predictions that benefit society; (2) Develop new tools and cyberinfrastructure that enhances research and education; and (3) to promote teaching, training, and learning. Specific NEFI forecasts, such as tick-borne disease risk, aquatic blooms, carbon sequestration, and leaf phenology, are of direct relevance to society. Forecasts will be made available via open cyberinfrastructure that disseminates forecasts to the public and allows other ecologists to contribute new forecasts. To produce these forecasts, NEFI will develop an open-source statistical package, ecoforecastR, which will advance the tools and techniques beyond what is currently used by the community. Finally, in addition to the graduate students directly mentored through the project, NEFI will run an annual summer course on ecological forecasting that will train the next generation of ecologists."

For this reason, mosquitoes have an enormous impact on humanity, as illustrated by the recent episodes of local Zika virus transmission in Florida and Texas, and the epidemic in Latin America. Preventing and mitigating the effects of mosquito-borne pathogens requires a detailed understanding of the interactions between mosquitoes and hosts. Globally, there are around 3,500 mosquito species, each with distinct preferences for certain hosts. Some take blood from any available vertebrate, but most prefer only certain animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, even fish). By understanding these relationships, researchers can assess how a pathogen moves through an ecosystem, and predict the risk of human infection. To investigate mosquito-host interactions, researchers use a method called blood meal analysis. Mosquito blood meals contain the DNA of their hosts, which is used to determine the host animal's identity. While these data provide insight on pathogen transmission, they can also improve understanding of vertebrate host communities. Results from this research will be disseminated via social media platforms and published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A graduates student will be trained and involved in all aspects of this work.<br/> <br/><br/>The taxonomic composition of host DNA within a sample of mosquito blood meals reflects the vertebrate host community. Data generated through mosquito blood meal analysis are traditionally collected, analyzed, and interpreted under an epidemiological context. Following the emergence of methods for molecular species detection and environmental DNA analysis, host DNA derived from the blood meals of hematophagous invertebrates has been recognized as a source of molecular data that is informative to vertebrate conservation. This research integrates epidemiological methods of mosquito blood meal analysis and vertebrate diversity assessment, with the aim of generating datasets that are simultaneously valuable to both conservation and the characterization of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission networks. Current blood meal analysis approaches rely largely on polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing of the DNA barcoding regions of host genes. Because host DNA derived from the mosquito gut is inherently degraded by digestion, next generation sequencing approaches are likely to enhance the ability of making successful identifications. This research will identify the hosts of mosquitoes collected at two sites in Florida, Everglades National Park and the University of Florida campus, through next generation sequencing. Mosquito blood meals will be used to characterize the host communities of both sites, detect the presence of Burmese pythons and other invasive vertebrates in the Everglades, and enhance the understanding of relationships between mosquito species and host communities."

Inland waters, which include streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs, are also dynamic ecosystems where these substances are consumed and transformed. Among the major compounds in aquatic environments are organic molecules dissolved in the water, and they include a complex solution of individual molecules that can affect water color, drinking water quality, light availability, dissolved oxygen levels, and ecosystem function.  Nevertheless, the understanding of how these organic molecules are processed remains limited, and this is especially true for larger systems like major rivers or entire drainage networks. This issue is addressed in this graduate student research project as the  student seeks to discover how much of the organic molecules are removed by biological and non-biological processes in three streams in New England. <br/><br/>This study builds upon existing research, applies a novel field method that characterizes the removal of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a scalable manner, and hypothesizes that biological uptake of dissolved organic matter is a relatively minor component of the total removal. This hypothesis is postulated upon the preliminary data from a method where oxygen reduction due to heterotrophy accounted for only small portion of dissolved organic matter removal in streams. The novel field method involves pulse injection of filtered maple leaf leachate into three different streams in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont where streams are constantly monitored with multi-probe sondes to detect changes in conductivity, DOM concentration, and oxygen level as the pulse of organic matter travels downstream. The solute transport data and grab samples acquired during the experiments are then used to calculate the total DOM removal, oxygen uptake due to heterotrophy, and organic matter quality change due to heterotrophy. In addition to the primary hypothesis, the preliminary data also hints at a novel priming mechanism where in-stream utilization of organic matter pulse in streams leads to boosted bioavailability by unlocking previous unavailable labile organic matter. The second hypothesis, aptly named ""self-priming,"" aims to verify the presence and mechanism of this novel concept."

How organisms buffer themselves against this variability, and exploit it, are major challenges for ecology. This project will combine new statistical and mathematical theory with long-term data sets on semi-arid plant communities to address two challenges in understanding how variable environments affect populations. The first goal will be to identify which environmental variables most strongly affect plant demographic rates such as survival, growth, and fecundity. This work will draw upon long-term studies on natural communities that provide observations on thousands of individual plants over multiple decades, along with numerous environmental variables that are measured at high spatial and temporal resolution. With so many potential explanatory variables, standard statistical methods for variable selection are unstable and unreliable. This project will combine data mining methods from machine learning techniques with traditional statistical theory to identify important environmental drivers, and build more reliable demographic models. Ecological questions that will be addressed include whether demographic rates respond primarily to resource availability (e.g., soil moisture) versus non-resource variables such as temperature; how environment and competition interact; and how strongly past conditions affect current performance. The empirical data sets will be used to answer these questions and look for generalities across multiple communities. A second goal is to understand the individual mechanisms that underlie effects of environmental variation. For example, if a plant population's growth is most affected by rainfall, is it because many plants die immediately, or because of long-term effects such as decreased life expectancy and smaller size throughout life? To address such questions, statistical methods from discrete-state random process theory will be extended to continuous states (e.g., individual plant size) and varying environments, and applied to the fitted plant demographic models. <br/><br/>An expected transformative outcome from this project will be new methods for demographic modeling and analysis, and much of its broader significance will be the applications of those tools in ecology, conservation biology and invasive species management.  Statistical products from this work will be disseminated freely as R code modules that users can adapt to their own study systems. The project will also support the research training and mentoring of a doctoral student in statistics, and a postdoctoral student in quantitative ecology."

Snowshoe hares exhibit classic 10-year population cycles across their northern range in Canada and Alaska, but in the southern part of their range (the northern continental U.S.) the cycles are thought to dampen or disappear, possibly due to habitat fragmentation and climate change. This project extends a long-term study of snowshoe hares across the western US and Canada to determine whether cycles are dampened in the lower 48 states, the role that climate change and habitat fragmentation play in cycle dampening, and the role that animal movement plays in synchronizing population dynamics across large spatial scales. The resulting data will both improve our understanding of a fundamental natural phenomenon and test hypotheses about the effects of human-caused changes on wildlife population dynamics.<br/><br/>Results from this project continue to garner widespread interest among policymakers, forest managers, and the general public, as they have direct implications for recovery of the threatened Canada lynx, a specialist predator on hares.

The investigators will continue research on 6 oak-forest plots to collect long-term data on acorn production; the population dynamics of mice, chipmunks, squirrels, and larval, nymphal, and adult blacklegged ticks; infection prevalence of ticks with Lyme disease bacteria; and  tick responses to specific climatic variables. Five additional years of data encompassing a more extensive range of host abundances, tick burdens, resources, and climatic conditions will generate the empirical base for constructing robust models of all tick life stages, questing and attached, to address biotic and abiotic drivers of tick population dynamics. Models will also be extended to distinguish the effects of climatic variables from those of host abundances and host resources on Lyme disease risk. The importance of contingencies in acorn-mouse-tick interactions will be explored. Although most years of high mouse abundance are followed by high nymph abundance, a recent mouse peak was not followed by a nymph peak. More robust and predictive models of the mast-mouse-tick system require the exploration of specific contingencies, which are likely to be episodic. Long-term trends in acorn production will be analyzed to decompose temporal variation in the magnitude and timing of masting events by individual species into patterns due to  individual variation in seed production versus changes in overall abundance and population size structure. Analyses of the seasonal timing of host-seeking by larvae and nymphs will be integrated with estimates of host population size to explain variation in nymphal infection prevalence and to improve predictions for this critical variable."

Most efforts to predict ecological responses to environmental changes only try to predict the future geographical ranges of species, not the actual number of individuals across the range, even though numbers are likely to be a far more important measure of ecological functioning. Among the problems with forecasting either range shifts or changes in numbers is the variability in the environment from year to year, such that short-term responses of species may be very different than long-term trends, necessitating the long-term studies to be carried out in this project. In addition, populations of widespread species often show adaptation to the local environment, so that the range of climatic conditions tolerated by a species as a whole may not reflect the suitable conditions for individuals in any one population. Ignoring local adaptation may lead to inaccurate predictions of both geographical ranges and numbers of individuals. Finally, the scientists leading this project will develop training materials and teach workshops to high school teachers in order to improve students' understanding of the ecological responses to changes in climate and other environmental conditions.<br/><br/>This project is designed to address these and other problems in predicting ecological responses to future environmental conditions, using a long-term data set combined with new experiments. The study focuses on two wide-spread plants that occur in western North America from northernmost Alaska to central New Mexico. Seventeen years of data on the species at sites across this latitudinal range have shown how environmental change can influence survival, growth and reproduction of these plants. In the current project, plants will be transplanted between multiple sites to test for local adaptation to environmental change in the field (evidence from growth chamber experiments suggests the potential for such adaptation). Using these data and those from past and ongoing surveys of natural populations, new models will be developed to predict plant numbers in response to local environmental conditions for populations across the continent. These predictions will then be tested against current distributions and population sizes. After this validation, the local models will be tied to global models to improve predictions of ecological responses to future environmental conditions. The goals of the project are both to better predict how these particular species will respond to changes in their environment and to develop and test methods for making such predictions that can be used for many other species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, not all species change their seasonal flowering time in response to the same climate factors.  Consequently, as climate changes, some species may flower too early, resulting in exposure to winter frosts, while others may flower too late or fail to shift their flowering enough to reproduce successfully. This project will improve our understanding of how the timing of flowering by individual species and groups of plant species shift in response to future climatic conditions.  This research is essential for forecasting the future availability of floral resources for pollinators and other animals that feed on nectar and pollen, as well as for assessing plant risk of exposure to frost damage, herbivore activity, and other seasonal stresses (e.g., summer drought). To date, however, no comprehensive, continental study of the direction and magnitude of changes in flowering time in response to changes in climate has been conducted.  This project will create a single, large database and make all data available online to the public.  In addition, this project will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Preliminary evidence suggests that the magnitude of phenological responsiveness (or sensitivity) to climate changes may be conserved among closely related and functionally similar taxa.  Consequently, it may be possible to predict the phenology of species that have not been studied through examination of closely related taxa that are well-documented.  Hundreds of thousands of electronic records archived in educational and research institutions throughout the United States provide standardized information about plant specimens collected by botanists across the U.S. over the past 200 years, including the date and location where each specimen was collected and whether it was flowering on the date of collection. This research integrates these disparate records into a single database, and leverages them to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across >1000 well-sampled species.  In turn, this information will be used to forecast shifts in seasonal flowering under projected climate scenarios. Digital herbarium records and recorded in situ observations will be used to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across an unprecedented diversity of angiosperms (>1000 species, each represented by >100 specimens; >400 genera; 80 families).

Adaptive radiations are the most dramatic and well-known examples of evolution.  They are also often thought to be one of the most important causes of the diversity of life on Earth, but they have only been well documented in a small number of cases. This project will reveal how important natural selection may have been in the adaptive radiation of mammals. It will help develop new methods to study the degree of influence of natural selection in evolutionary history. Understanding how predictable natural selection has been would allow a much better understanding of many features of a species, from its biochemistry to its morphology. Teasing apart the relative roles of adaptation and inherited traits will improve the efficiency of any research that compares different species, such as biomedical studies, using mice, rats, or other species, to understand human health. This project will also help train the next generation of scientists, from high school to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. Three-dimensional images of hundreds of species will be posted online and made available to other researchers to use in their studies. These images will provide a valuable source of data for scientists and will be a valuable educational tool for teachers and students.<br/><br/>This project will test whether one of the most important diversification events in mammals, the taxon Oryzomyalia, a group of over 350 rodent species that descended from a single colonization of South America 7-10 million years ago, was an adaptive radiation. Next-generation DNA sequencing will resolve the very rapid diversification early after colonization. New DNA sequence data will be added to existing data to yield a largely complete phylogeny of at least 330 species. Diverse aspects of their phenotype, including teeth, skull,limbs, vertebrae, fur, and climatic tolerances, will be measured for 265 species. Model-based methods will test for an early rapid phenotypic divergence with subsequent slow-down. Divergence patterns will be explored in finer detail, testing for radiations within subgroups.

This project exploits an unrivalled legacy of information beginning in 1987 to evaluate the form in which reefs will persist, and the extent to which they will be able to resist further onslaughts of environmental challenges. This long-term project continues a 27-year study of Caribbean coral reefs.

The data will also reveal the structure and function of reefs in a future with more human disturbances, when corals may no longer dominate tropical reefs. <br/><br/>The broad societal impacts of this project include advancing understanding of an ecosystem that has long been held emblematic of the beauty, diversity, and delicacy of the biological world. Proposed research will expose new generations of undergraduate and graduate students to natural history and the quantitative assessment of the ways in which our planet is changing. This training will lead to a more profound understanding of contemporary ecology at the same time that it promotes excellence in STEM careers and supports technology infrastructure in the United States. Partnerships will be established between universities and high schools to bring university faculty and students in contact with k-12 educators and their students, allow teachers to carry out research in inspiring coral reef locations, and motivate children to pursue STEM careers.

This study will investigate midges in Lake Mvatn, Iceland, and why their abundance fluctuates over 4 orders of magnitude in irregular cycles lasting 4-7 years. Adult midges that emerge from the lake die on shore. During high-midge years, the weight of midges that are deposited in the surrounding heathland is equivalent to 10 humpback whales, providing food for predators and scavengers, nutrients for plants, and the basis for local agriculture. By synthesizing results from field samples and experiments over several population cycles, this project promises new insights into fundamental scientific questions about the causes and consequences of population outbreaks. The project will engage graduate and undergraduate students who will work at Mvatn each summer, providing them exposure to extreme biology as well as to educational diversity, as they work in both the lake and on the shoreline under the tutelage of an interdisciplinary group of scientists. The public will learn more about midge outbreaks through an ongoing 'Smidge of Midge' blog.<br/><br/>Ecosystems that show huge changes through time can reveal the ecological forces that stabilize or destabilize natural dynamics. This project involves both long-term data collection in aquatic and terrestrial systems and targeted experiments to test specific hypotheses. The aquatic data collection will build and expand on an existing database that dates back to the 1970s. The project has added weekly monitoring of many additional variables, including midge larvae density, benthic primary production, and pelagic nutrients. The collection of terrestrial data has continued with the monitoring of midge infall and arthropod communities along transects around the lake that were established in 2008. A suite of targeted experiments will address a wide range of research questions such as (i) the role that midges play as ecosystem engineers, changing benthic conditions to favor large-bodied epibenthic cladocerans over small-bodied infaunal species, (ii) the mutualistic effect that midge larvae have on algal growth, and (iii) the importance of midge adults for the flowering of carnivorous plants. These experimental projects are led by graduate students as part of their PhD theses, and by undergraduate interns as independent projects. This combination of aquatic and terrestrial experiments together with regular sampling will test hypotheses about how the lake and shoreline ecosystems are linked together. The research will examine whether the instability of the lake ecosystem could drive instability of the surrounding ecosystem on land."

The drought will dramatically alter which species are present in the ecosystems of the Rockies and their relative abundances. The drought thus presents an unusual opportunity to study how pollination networks (the connections between interacting pollinator and plant species) are affected by disturbances. This is important given that extreme environmental events are expected to become increasingly common and that pollination is critically important for the maintenance of both wild plant populations and the productivity and security of many agricultural crops. Specifically, this project is focused on 1) how species in ecosystems can form new connections to other species after disturbances; 2) how new connections can be predicted even following major disturbance; and 3) the implications of new patterns of plant-pollinator relationships for understanding ecosystem-level responses to disturbance. This work will contribute to better understanding of how networks (including other ecological networks, and other network types such as economic, engineered, and social networks) respond to disturbances, particularly in terms of the formation of new connections.<br/><br/>This project will use existing plant-pollinator network field data from non-drought years (2016 and 2017) to build and test mechanism-focused models of network structure, based on plant and pollinator abundances, competition between pollinators for flowers, and data on plant and pollinator physical traits (such as body size). Model predictions will be compared with field data from the severe drought year (2018) in which it is anticipated that there will be a strong reduction in which species are present (for example, many long-lived plant species may not bloom when drought-stressed) as well as substantial changes in relative abundances of flowers and pollinators. In particular, the project will also assess how well this new network model performs relative to existing alternative models (none of which currently perform well in predicting interactions). The researchers will then use models to assess generally how substantial capacity for re-wiring will affect system-level responses to perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, high variability is an apt descriptor of the hydrologic regimes for streams in this region. In this project, researchers are using new statistical techniques that describe hydrological regimes, coupled with long-term measurements of stream structure and processes, to understand how shifts in climate and river discharge regimes on many time scales will influence the ecosystem. The research will focus on factors that explain why the abundance and distribution of wetland plants and the degree of nitrogen limitation vary dramatically among years. Also, the variation among years in patterns of change after spring floods - in primary production, nutrient retention, and community composition (of invertebrates and plants)- will be related to within- and among-year variation in hydrology, to determine the impact of regimes on these successional patterns. Finally, an interdisciplinary team of collaborators will reevaluate stream ecosystem models and test new models using long-term data from this and other desert streams. <br/><br/>This research will advance synthesis of long-term data from desert streams and advance understanding in ways that can contribute to the general theory of stability of multiple ecosystem states.

Arctic vegetation greening may not necessarily result in increases in carbon sequestration in Arctic tundra due to complex and uncertain soil processes. Arctic tundra tends to have a thicker organic soil horizon (peat) than most other zonal biomes; research shows that peatlands comprise a sustained carbon sink. If shallow peatlands are widespread throughout the Arctic, the overall net carbon storage capacity of tundra might be underestimated globally. However, the factors controlling the formation, distribution, and dynamics of these peat patches across the Arctic are not well understood. The overall goal of the project is to understand organic soil (peat) accumulation processes in the tundra biome and to assess the role of peat in regional and pan-Arctic carbon budgets at decadal and centennial timescales. The project will examine potential peat migration/expansion frontiers in a warming Arctic and their significance in the regional and pan-Arctic carbon cycle. The project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs from diverse socio-economic and cultural backgrounds in both data analysis and modeling. The public education and outreach program includes STEM activities involving middle and high school students and a symposium on Arctic environments. The understanding of environmental conditions and processes that control the formation and northward migrations of the green peat frontier will inform Arctic stakeholders in their use of natural resources.<br/><br/>This multidisciplinary research team of researchers will integrate (1) new data collection from multiple tundra sites along the northernmost peat-forming frontiers of the North American Arctic, together with (2) laboratory incubation experiments, (3) a synthesis of existing data from the tundra and boreal biomes, and (4) ecosystem-scale process model simulations. The overarching question is: will the warming Arctic transform into a peat-rich landscape, as the boreal zone is now, or are there essential conditions lacking in a warming Arctic that will prevent this? To address this broad question, the research focuses on two key elements of the Arctic peat-forming ecosystems: peat patches, and the role of Sphagnum in the formation, persistence, and rapid rates of carbon sequestration of these potentially incipient peatlands. Using observational, experimental, and modeling results, along with synthesis products from a coordinated international research network, the research team will test hypotheses on (1) the ages, carbon accumulation rates, and continental pattern of these rapidly forming and migrating peat patches; (2) the various responses of production and decomposition processes to temperature and moisture change; and (3) the role of Sphagnum in modifying microclimate and shifting balance between their productivity and decomposability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their diversity is staggering, with more than 500,000 species thought to exist. These minute wasps (mostly 1-2 mm in size) are numerically abundant and common in almost every habitat. The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control. The evolutionary events leading to this enormous diversity in morphology, biology and rates of diversification are poorly understood, leading to an artificial system of taxonomic classification. In this research project, researchers will use a diverse array of molecular, morphological and bioinformatics approaches to develop a solid understanding of the hierarchy of relationships across the entire group. These relationships will then be used to reclassify major groups to reflect common ancestry, to provide a framework for a web-accessible portal to manage and deliver information on their diverse biology, and to explore the evolutionary changes that have driven and shaped this enormous radiation of terrestrial insects.<br/><br/>The objectives of the research project are to 1) generate a robust molecular phylogeny of the Chalcidoidea using new data from transcriptomes and targeted DNA enrichment for over 400 species, 2) generate morphological data for over 200 fossils from Eocene and Cretaceous amber and combine these with a comprehensive morphological data set for extant taxa, 3) develop a revised classification of Chalcidoidea in book form through a series of workshops and worldwide collaborations, and 4) make available information on the taxonomy, biology and distribution of over 31,000 available names and information in over 40,000 references. The project will train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student and several undergraduates. To involve the wider scientific community, a worldwide group of biocontrol researchers and taxonomists will develop a new classification for Chalcidoidea.

Features such as changes in life history, may be one explanation for the big differences among these rates. In insects, changes in diet, sociality, and mode of parasitism have been investigated for their impact on species formation.  However, very few groups of insects include species that have all of these life history traits, making it difficult to compare their individual impacts. The ants, wasps and bees (Aculeata) represent one such group; their numerous species exhibit a diversity of life histories.  The researchers will use new methods of genome sequencing to uncover the evolutionary relationships among the 65,000 described species of ants, wasps and bees. This research will provide important insights into differences in rates of speciation for a large group of organisms with sophisticated social systems (including ants, hornets, yellow jackets, honey bees and bumblebees) and the economically important group of pollinating insects (bees). This project will contribute significantly to the development of scientific expertise and improved infrastructure in the United States. It will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in sophisticated methods of DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, computer programming, and phylogenetic analysis. Protocols and data will be made publically available. The project will develop a traveling public exhibit on the biodiversity, evolutionary history, and importance of our most important agricultural pollinators (bees).<br/><br/>The research team will take advantage of new technological innovations in DNA sequencing to generate massive data sets for resolving the relationships of the Aculeata. Using highly conserved regions of the genome (ultraconserved elements) they will enrich genomic libraries for genes of interest. These enriched libraries will then be subjected to sequencing using the latest sequencing technologies. Using bioinformatics tools, the data sets will be assembled, aligned, and analyzed to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among aculeate taxa and determine where and when shifts in diversification took place."

The region has experienced a series of severely dry years in the past two decades, most recently in 2012. However in an El Nino year, such as 2016, winter precipitation can be several times greater than average. Drought years increase mortality in forest and woodland trees, and the trees that survive drought require a period of several years before regaining normal growth capacity. Although high winter precipitation generally promotes better growth, it may be the case that a tree's ability to take advantage of a good year depends on its drought history. This is because the anatomical and physiological changes in trees that survive seem to reduce a tree?s ability to transport water and support high rates of photosynthesis and new growth.  This project will use a set of study sites in the Four-Corners region of the southwest that span a wide range of increased winter precipitation from the current El Nio.  Because previous studies at these same sites have documented the growth impacts of recent droughts, this project can now test whether trees that suffered larger drought impacts are less able to respond positively to the increased water provided by the El Nio.  The study species include aspen, pion pine, and juniper, species that differ in drought tolerance and ability to use shallow versus deeper soil moisture. The results from this project will strengthen understanding of how precipitation variability, which is expected to increase with continued climate warming, affects productivity of southwestern ecosystems.  This study will provide research experience for multiple undergraduate students including individuals from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The current El Nio has produced a rare gradient in winter (Oct 2015-Feb 2016) precipitation across the Four-Corners region, spanning 25% to over 400% of the long-term mean. Four years prior, the 2011-2012 drought significantly and negatively impacted tree populations, soil moisture availability, and ecosystem carbon sequestration. Recent work has demonstrated that it takes 3-5 years for tree growth, ecosystem carbon fluxes, and net ecosystem productivity to recover from past, severe droughts.  What is unknown is whether these prolonged impacts of past droughts affect how trees and ecosystems respond to extreme increase in precipitation created by an El Nio. Thus, this project seeks to determine the extent to which past climatic conditions, especially droughts, govern tree physiological and growth responses during wet periods.  To accomplish this, the project will sample multiple U.S. Forest Service forest inventory (FIA) sites representative of the climate variability in the Four-Corners region and for which complementary tree- and plot-level data are available. These sites support three focal, foundational tree species (aspen, pion, juniper) that differ in their drought tolerance strategies. The study will employ a unique combination of repeated physiological measurements, dendrochronology approaches, and statistical modeling that will enable new insight into climate legacies, their impact on tree physiological processes, and subsequent implications for tree growth during potentially ?favorable? conditions. This study will generate a unique and extensive dataset over a relatively short time period, which can be used to test the nave assumption that high precipitation significantly stimulates tree growth. It is expected to demonstrate that tree growth responses to rare wet years are controlled by past climatic influences. Field campaigns and laboratory studies will involve multiple undergraduates, an early career research associate, and will seek to involve individuals from under-represented groups. Findings from the study will be disseminated via the scientific literature and popular media; tree-ring data will be contributed to the freely accessible International Tree-Ring Data Bank."

They constitute the majority of all living organisms, yet little is known about their diversity, behavior and genomics. This project focuses on amoeboid organisms belonging to the supergroup Amoebozoa. They exist in diverse natural habitats including marine, freshwater, and soil environments, and as symbionts or parasites affecting livestock and humans. Amoebozoans have long been considered simple and primitive, but recent studies have shown that they are more complex than previously thought. Despite their evolutionary and ecological significance, the biodiversity and evolution of Amoebozoans is not well understood. This project uses a combination of methods including whole genome analysis and advanced microscopy to resolve their phylogeny (how they are related to each other). The project will also examine key evolutionary features such as genome size and complexity as well as mechanisms of amoeboid movement. Knowledge of amoeboid movement has broad implications beyond Amoebozoans. It will give insights into groups that employ similar locomotive mechanisms, such as mammalian cells including macrophages and cancer cells. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for women of African American origin and a postdoctoral fellow in advanced microscopy, genomics, proteomics, phylogenomics and microbial diversity.<br/><br/><br/>Recent molecular studies made significant progress in our understanding of Amoebozoan diversity and evolution. However, the deep relationships among Amoebozoan subgroups are largely unresolved and some key lineages remain unplaced in the tree of Amoebozoa. The supergroup Amoebozoa is an old lineage, estimated to have evolved from a common ancestor over a billion years ago. Resolving ancient relationships is a difficult endeavor due to limited data and other historic and algorithmic challenges. This project will use a combination of approaches including cellular proteomic and whole genome sequencing to resolve the tree of Amoebozoa. Genome sequencing will provide not only large amounts of genetic data helpful for resolving the tree of Amoebozoa but also additional genomic architectural data that can be used to study the evolution of the group. Given that Amoebozoa holds a key evolutionary position in the tree of life, resolving the tree of Amoebozoa will elucidate many fundamental evolutionary questions including the origin and evolution of life cycles, multicellularity, host-parasite interactions, amoeboid movement, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) across domains. In addition to this, study of Amoebozoan genomes and their complexity will give insights on how genome size impacts behavior and adaptation to various ecological niches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pristine lakes within those landscapes, especially lakes whose iconic beauty has led to their designation as World Heritage sites, have strong tourist appeal. Yet that beauty is threatened by changes to the clarity of the lake waters. Conservation efforts for these potentially fragile ecosystems would benefit from a predictive understanding of lake responses to global climate change. This research explores the consequences of these landscape-level changes for lake ecosystems.  Rather than study a single system over a long time, these researchers will substitute a comparison of lake ecosystems that currently differ in the extent of glacial and vegetation coverage in the catchment.  The primary aim of the research is to compare lake responses to rain and snowmelt-driven inputs of materials such as glacial flour, the finely ground rock from glaciers, and dissolved products of organic matter decomposition.  Both of these materials have strong effects on the clarity of the water or water transparency, which in turn influences many aspects of lake ecosystem function.  Lake responses will be examined using two complementary measurements of ecological resilience: resistance, the magnitude of change in the system following rain or snowmelt events; and recovery, the rate of return to previous conditions.  Project findings will deepen the basic scientific understanding of the effects of changing landscapes on lake ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains.  Undergraduate students will be engaged in all stages of the research, including planning, data collection, analysis, and publication.  Targeted efforts will be made to attract students from diverse backgrounds and experiences.  Because water transparency of mountain lakes is a powerful case study through which to communicate ecosystem-level effects of environmental change to a broader audience, a short film describing the research will be produced and  distributed.<br/><br/>The proposed research will test the overarching hypothesis that changes in the resilience of water transparency occur systematically as lake catchments shift from glaciated to rocky to vegetated states.  Specifically, resistance of water transparency is predicted to increase with glacial loss and decrease with vegetation advance.  Additionally, recovery rates of water transparency are predicted to increase as the regulator of transparency shifts from suspended rock flour in glacial catchment lakes to dissolved organic matter (DOM) in vegetated catchment lakes.  To test these hypotheses, high frequency monitoring buoys equipped with sensors that measure turbidity and the fluorescent component of DOM will be deployed in five lakes that vary across a gradient of glacial and vegetation coverage.  Concurrent hydrological data will be used to better understand dynamics of material inputs and their relationships to meteorological data recorded at nearby weather stations.  More generally, the research probes the relationship between the two components of resilience by testing whether resistance and recovery change independently as glaciers retreat and vegetation advances.  The potential for uncoupled changes in the two components of resilience is a unique and transformative aspect of the research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the face of climate change and other environmental challenges, society can no longer rely solely on past experience to understand and manage the living world. This award asks the question, ?What would it take to forecast ecological processes the same way we forecast the weather?? This project will development an operational ecological forecasting capability similar to weather forecasting that uses an iterative cycle between making forecasts, performing analyses, and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for building a forecast capacity, and also a crucial part of any decision making under high uncertainty. In addition to making ecology more relevant to management, near-term forecasts routinely compare specific, quantitative predictions to new data, which is one of the strongest tests of any scientific theory. This project will generate near-term forecasts that leverage ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network and spanning a wide range of themes: leaf phenology, land carbon and energy fluxes, tick-borne disease incidence, small-mammal populations, aquatic productivity, and soil microbial diversity and function. This broad, comparative approach will be used to address cross-cutting questions about the nature of predictability in ecology and develop an overarching body of forecasting theory and methods.<br/><br/> The Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI) will advance ecological knowledge at three levels: (1) overarching across-theme hypotheses about the predictability of ecological systems; (2) pressing within-theme questions about what drives process and predictability; and (3) advancing the tools and techniques that will enable an iterative approach to quantitative hypothesis testing. The overarching hypotheses of this project are that: (1) ecological predictability is more driven by processes error than initial condition error; (2) there are consistent patterns in the sources of uncertainty across themes; (3) across themes, spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated; and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated with limits of predictability. Overall, the answers to these questions address to what extent there are general patterns to ecological predictability, which would advance both our basic understanding of ecological processes and constrain the practical problem of making forecasts.<br/><br/>The expected outcomes of NEFI are to: (1) Disseminate data products and predictions that benefit society; (2) Develop new tools and cyberinfrastructure that enhances research and education; and (3) to promote teaching, training, and learning. Specific NEFI forecasts, such as tick-borne disease risk, aquatic blooms, carbon sequestration, and leaf phenology, are of direct relevance to society. Forecasts will be made available via open cyberinfrastructure that disseminates forecasts to the public and allows other ecologists to contribute new forecasts. To produce these forecasts, NEFI will develop an open-source statistical package, ecoforecastR, which will advance the tools and techniques beyond what is currently used by the community. Finally, in addition to the graduate students directly mentored through the project, NEFI will run an annual summer course on ecological forecasting that will train the next generation of ecologists."

The researchers hypothesize that microbiome community assembly and disassembly involve deterministic processes of niche filtering, species interactions, and dispersal. This research will test the hypothesis that changes in host ecology wrought by habitat degradation will alter the relative influence of these processes with consequences for community composition and function. Bats will be studied across a forest modification gradient in Malaysia, and individually-matched samples of gut-microbial composition, metagenome function, dietary composition, host genotype and measures of social interaction obtained for each bat. These data, in conjunction with analyses of co-occurrence, phylogenetic and functional trait patterns, will be used to test structural equation models specified to untangle the processes structuring communities in a causal modeling framework. Evidence of the role of dispersal in structuring microbiomes will derive from comparisons of co-distributed host species that differ in sociality. Interspecific associations will be assessed using co-occurrence network approaches. Functional trait space is developed from genomic inference for each bacterial phylotype within an individual bat's microbiome. Phylogenies are estimated using maximum likelihood and 16S gene alignment among community members. To test the role of diet and host genetics (the host environment) in community processes, the researchers describe diet from feces with the COI DNA barcodes, and quantify host diversity and relatedness through genome fingerprinting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite being important players in tropical ecosystems, stick insect diversity and evolution is the least understood of any large insect group.   Many stick insects rely on ants to help disperse their eggs, but little is known about how this complex interaction evolved.  The project will result in a greater understanding of stick insect evolution and the first, comprehensive understanding of species diversity.  Because stick insects are common and diverse in the tropics, this research will provide critical baseline data for ongoing tropical conservation efforts.  Four undergraduate students will gain training in all aspects of the scientific process using stick insects as a focal group. An interactive museum exhibit targeted to K-12 students will present the evolution of stick insect camouflage, ant associations, and the role these insects play in the natural world.  The exhibit will also focus on conservation issues in the tropics, using the Lord Howe Stick Insect as an example of species rescue and recovery.  <br/><br/>The project will reconstruct a robust phylogeny for stick insects based on DNA sequence data, document the parallel evolution of the different stick insect body types, investigate shifts from crypsis to aposematism, and determine whether these shifts are correlated with other life history traits and species radiations. The project will decipher the evolution of stick insect oviposition techniques, determine how many times egg dispersal via ants has evolved, investigate correlates of adult dispersal ability and reliance on ant-mediated egg dispersal, and study the temporal and geographic overlap of particular plant and phasmid species.  It will also provide the baseline data to understand a fascinating cross-kingdom convergence on reliance on ant-mediated egg dispersal in both stick insects and angiosperms.  This project will provide the scaffolding for future taxonomic work, revisionary systematics, and studies into the evolution of their unique forms."

Pollinators are also a vital component of global agriculture, and pollination services by insects are worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Given their importance, it is critical that we develop an understanding of how insect pollinator communities interact with plants across complex landscapes that are often heavily modified by humans. Researchers have recently begun using ""network"" approaches to study plant-pollinator interactions across entire ecological communities. A plant-pollinator network can be visualized as a ""web"" of all interactions between pollinators and plants at a given place. By building and evaluating plant-pollinator networks, researchers can, for example, assess whether pollination at a given site will remain stable in the face of disturbance or loss of species. This is especially relevant, considering that human-induced stressors, such as habitat loss and pesticide use, are causing pollinator declines worldwide. This research will use a new genetic approach to determine which plant species are pollinated by which bee species in ten Kansas prairies. Data will be used to construct plant-pollinator networks to assess the potential effect of disturbance and loss of pollinator species on pollination services across human-modified landscapes.  As part of this project, the research team will conduct pollinator ecology workshops for middle- and high school students aspiring to be first-generation college graduates.  <br/><br/>Plant-pollinator networks are typically constructed from observations of insects landing on flowers (i.e., ""visitation networks""). Few researchers have evaluated these insects for the presence and species identities of pollen carried between flowers; doing so based on pollen morphology is especially time-consuming. In this project, investigators will use metabarcoding to identify pollen carried by native bees collected across ten study sites. Several structural properties of the resulting pollen transport networks will be compared to the properties of networks based on visitation data alone. Investigators predict that: A) pollen transport networks will exhibit greater network-level specialization than visitation networks, and B) pollen transport networks will be less nested than visitation networks, indicating that plant-pollinator interactions could be more susceptible to species loss than the visitation data, alone, would suggest."

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred.

These non-native species have large effects on biodiversity and ecosystems, cause enormous economic damage, and are one of the most important and least controlled of human impacts on the world's ecosystems. Scientists know that these effects can change through time, but the amount, timing, and nature of these changes are poorly known. This project will continue a long-term study of the changing impacts of the zebra mussel on the Hudson River ecosystem, an ecologically and economically important invasive species that first appeared in the Hudson River in 1991. This study will improve understanding of one of the world's most problematic invaders in aquatic ecosystems, and provide one of very few detailed studies of the long-term effects on a non-native species. The results of this research will continue to be used by government agencies that manage the Hudson River, and should inform management of non-native species in general. Findings will be disseminated by posting research data on open websites, continuing highly successful educational programs to provide data, lesson materials, and training to middle- and high-school teachers and students in the Hudson Valley and New York City school systems, and continuing an active program of public outreach.<br/><br/>The researchers will continue measuring population parameters (density, mortality rates and size structure) and filtration rates of zebra mussels, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton density and species composition, bacteria production, water quality parameters (transparency and nutrient concentrations) and particulate and dissolved Carbon to answer the following questions: (1) How will the long-term changes in the zebra mussel population and its effects continue to develop? (2) Can these changes be explained by relationships between the size and characteristics of the zebra mussel population and the Hudson River ecosystem? (3) How does zebra mussel grazing interact with climate to shape properties of the Hudson River ecosystem? The researchers will use time series and regression models to explore zebra mussel population dynamics and the relationship between zebra mussel filtration rates and various components of the river food web. In addition they will analyze three interactions between zebra mussel invasion and climate: 1) effects of freshwater flow on zebra mussel grazing, 2) effects of water temperature and mussel grazing on phytoplankton biomass and 3) correlations between warm temperature and inter-annual variation in zebra mussel mortality. Five additional years of data will allow the researchers to document the remarkable changes that are now occurring in the Hudson River, and substantially increase the power of statistical models to describe these events."

However, the process describing and classifying microorganisms continues to be very challenging. The dominant taxonomic system for Bacteria and Archaea relies on the careful description of single-species cultures, stemming from traditions rooted deeply in the history of microbiology. In recent decades, microbiologists have increasingly relied on molecular investigations, including single-cell genomics and metagenomics, which provide insight into prokaryotes without reliance on cultivation in the laboratory. In parallel, progress has been made to reframe microbial systematics in the genomics age, which in principle could enable expansion of the taxonomic structure to include uncultivated organisms. However, uncultivated microorganisms have no status within the code of nomenclature and currently there is no system to name uncultivated organisms. This project will involve three meetings over the course of ~18 months to convene a group of world experts to develop a cohesive plan to integrate uncultivated prokaryotes into a systematics framework. Ultimately, an actionable plan will be created to modify the code governing microbial nomenclature and to publish a blueprint for prokaryotic systematics for the next decade. The results of this project will impact all microbiologists, including microbial ecologists and clinicians, by providing a robust plan for a system of nomenclature for all prokaryotes. The project will also engage groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields and provide leadership opportunities for early-career scientists. <br/><br/><br/>The project will involve three workshops. Workshop 1 will engage experts on the systematics and genomics of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and will consider several existing proposals and to integrate uncultivated microorganisms into a system of nomenclature, including a call to modify guidelines for Candidatus status, a call to enable genomic material to be used as type material for taxonomic proposals, and more aggressive proposals to recalibrate all of microbial systematics using genomic data. The workshop will also review two different proposals for the standardization of genomic data for taxonomic purposes. Workshop 2 will discuss existing databases that are relevant to microbial taxonomy such as the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature, the Microbial Genomes Atlas, the Digital Protologue Database, and the Genome Taxonomy Database with a goal of better integration and development of systems to link diverse datasets directly to taxonomic data. Workshop 3 will engage a small working group to pull together the findings of the two workshops, synthesize recommendations and provide recommendations on how to proceed and implement these recommendations. The outcome of the workshops will be an actionable plan to integrate uncultivated organisms into a system of nomenclature and a roadmap to guide microbial systematics for the next decade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advent of low-cost genome sequencing has revolutionized the field of systematics and the use of genetic data to infer the evolutionary relationships of organisms. But the ability to generate data on genome structure and variation has outpaced  understanding on how to use it to infer evolutionary history and species relationships. This project will analyze the impact of genomic features on evolutionary inference in the cat family. Because cat species relationships are well understood, genomic data are available for several species, and genetic tools are available that allow detailed analyses, cats are an excellent system to investigate how chromosome characteristics and structural variation in the genome affect evolution and the inference of evolutionary history. This study promises to have a large impact on the field of systematics and evolutionary biology. This study also has broader impacts on society. Cats are consistently ranked as the most charismatic and recognizable symbols of wildlife and animal conservation, and provide a gateway to engagement and learning about biology and evolution across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. One of the most important project outcomes will be the development of a website by student recruits and researchers, describing and integrating research outcomes with information on the members of the cat family, and connecting these to the public.<br/><br/>Using the remarkable radiation of the cat family Felidae as a model system, this project will generate high quality genome sequence assemblies from all living species to identify the impact of chromosomal characteristics on the accuracy of species tree inference. Novel computational algorithms will be developed to search, sort, and characterize genome-wide variation in topology, tree shape and divergence time, and connect this variation to genomic features predictive of the species tree. The ultimate goal is to understand which chromosomal features have positive and negative influences on accurate species tree estimation, to guide future principles and applications of phylogenomics. Felids are an excellent model system because of the high rate of recombination within the family and the existence of established genomic tools and information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How organisms buffer themselves against this variability, and exploit it, are major challenges for ecology. This project will combine new statistical and mathematical theory with long-term data sets on semi-arid plant communities to address two challenges in understanding how variable environments affect populations. The first goal will be to identify which environmental variables most strongly affect plant demographic rates such as survival, growth, and fecundity. This work will draw upon long-term studies on natural communities that provide observations on thousands of individual plants over multiple decades, along with numerous environmental variables that are measured at high spatial and temporal resolution. With so many potential explanatory variables, standard statistical methods for variable selection are unstable and unreliable. This project will combine data mining methods from machine learning techniques with traditional statistical theory to identify important environmental drivers, and build more reliable demographic models. Ecological questions that will be addressed include whether demographic rates respond primarily to resource availability (e.g., soil moisture) versus non-resource variables such as temperature; how environment and competition interact; and how strongly past conditions affect current performance. The empirical data sets will be used to answer these questions and look for generalities across multiple communities. A second goal is to understand the individual mechanisms that underlie effects of environmental variation. For example, if a plant population's growth is most affected by rainfall, is it because many plants die immediately, or because of long-term effects such as decreased life expectancy and smaller size throughout life? To address such questions, statistical methods from discrete-state random process theory will be extended to continuous states (e.g., individual plant size) and varying environments, and applied to the fitted plant demographic models. <br/><br/>An expected transformative outcome from this project will be new methods for demographic modeling and analysis, and much of its broader significance will be the applications of those tools in ecology, conservation biology and invasive species management.  Statistical products from this work will be disseminated freely as R code modules that users can adapt to their own study systems. The project will also support the research training and mentoring of a doctoral student in statistics, and a postdoctoral student in quantitative ecology."

Such changes in forests are often attributed to changes in fire occurrence and frequency, but analyses of tree rings suggest other environmental changes such as rising CO2 and changes in weather patterns that may have contributed to shifts in forests and savannas. In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award funds will be used to measure tree ring carbon stable isotopes to estimate annual trends in water use efficiency across a network of savanna and forest sites to determine the mechanism for changes in tree growth and the trends observed in historical survey and ring-width data. A better understanding of the many factors responsible for changing forest cover in the past will help in understanding how anticipated future environmental changes might affect Midwestern forests: Hotter temperatures and drought stress could drive tree decline, pushing today's forests towards the savanna state. Alternatively, increases in CO2 may confer drought resilience by enhancing tree growth, and favoring forest expansion. These alternative trajectories for the Midwest create uncertainty in predicting future vegetation distribution and make it difficult for local land and forest managers to develop effective resource management plans.  <br/><br/>The award funds will be used to test the hypothesis that increased atmospheric CO2 has driven past changes in tree growth and altered forest resilience to future changes. This research advances scientific understanding of how environmental changes affect Midwestern forest resilience and growth, and more broadly identifies the conditions where tree growth is resilient to environmental changes. This award builds on a network of sites where the researchers have developed annual tree ring growth records from 1850-2015 for oak trees in both closed forest and open savannas.  From the annual trends in tree ring growth across these sites, the researchers have identified places where tree growth has increased since 1950 and where the growth-climate relationships change over time. Such shifts are consistent with CO2 driven enhancement of tree water use efficiency (carbon uptake by the tree per unit of water needed), which can theoretically drive increases in tree growth and improve drought tolerance in trees.  However, growth data alone cannot determine if CO2 fertilization is the mechanism for these changes. Thus, researchers will use stable carbon isotopes in tree rings, which are related to water use efficiency, to determine the extent to which rising CO2 can explain changes in tree growth. Overall, this project will test whether CO2 enhancement played a role in stabilizing trends in Midwest forest cover, and will provide scientific insight into the conditions necessary for CO2 enhancement of tree growth."

These factors do not act independently. For example, the strength of competition among trees may be stronger in low fertility soils. However, only a few studies have examined the simultaneous effects of physical factors and biological processes on tree growth and survival. Such synthesis is central to predicting tree species responses to environmental change. This is a critical issue in tropical forests because these ecosystems are experiencing rapid environmental change and play a key role in regulating global climate. This research will develop a novel analytical approach to characterize the joint effects of physical heterogeneity and local biological interactions on growth and survival of tree species across the island of Puerto Rico. The island has high tree diversity, marked environmental and climate gradients, and an extensive amount of existing data, making this an ideal site for this research. Results from this study will inform the likelihood of success of several USDA Forest Service initiatives to adapt to rapid environmental change. Existing collaborations between the researchers and local organizations will facilitate a direct impact on the management and conservation of Puerto Rican forests. Data will be made available online and provided directly to local management agencies, including the US Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. The researchers also will organize workshops on the analytical methods at Puerto Rican institutions. Finally, the project will train and employ a Puerto Rican technician and a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Range dynamics and community assembly reflect the interactive effects of regional environmental heterogeneity and local processes. Yet empirical examination of these interactions is rare. The researchers will develop a novel functional trait-based, spatially-explicit neighborhood approach to disentangle local effects of environmental heterogeneity and biotic interactions on tree growth and survival across Puerto Rico while accounting for individual trait variation. To do so, they will couple (a) tree trait measurements across species ranges traits, including traits related to water use strategies, (b) trait-based neighborhood models of tree growth and survival derived from data collected in 24 mapped plots, and (c) generalized joint attribute models that characterize species distributions with respect to regional environmental gradients using herbaria collections. They will test the following hypotheses: (1) the negative effect of local biotic interactions on tree growth and survival is highest at the most environmentally favorable sites for a species, fostering regional coexistence; (2) the spatial structure of intraspecific trait variation across environmental gradients fosters such coexistence. Results from this research will empirically examine the importance of individual trait variation in mediating regional species coexistence and test the importance of a stabilizing mechanism in promoting species-coexistence and diversity in tropical forests. The research will lay a conceptual foundation for future studies that place local community interactions within a biogeographic context and transform understanding of the environmental and biotic factors that mediate forest community assembly at regional scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

The performance of a plant's life history strategy depends on temperature, rainfall and soil nutrients. These environmental conditions vary around the world and from year to year. Over a long period of time, the life history strategy of a species adapts to the ranges of temperature, rainfall and other environmental conditions at a location. A plant adapted to do well in a desert may not be well adapted to live in a rain forest, and vice versa. When environmental conditions in a particular location change, a species' life history strategy may no longer be adapted to the new conditions, and its population growth rate may suffer. A plant species may be able to evolve a new strategy that works better in the changed environment, but the rate of adaptation may not keep pace with rapid environmental change. In that case local populations will shrink, increasing the risk of the species' extinction. Society needs to predict which plants are most at risk from changed environments to efficiently allocate scarce resources to species conservation. This study uses mathematical models to predict the best life history strategy for plant species living different environments, and to quantify how poorly adapted a species is to a change in the environment. Testing predictions of the effects of rapid environmental change on plant life history is difficult without measuring plant growth and reproduction in many years with a wide range of environmental conditions. Such long-term data sets are extremely rare, but in this study researchers will make use of a 30 year-long data set on the growth and reproduction of the plant species bitterroot milkvetch (Astragalus scaphoides), to test the predictions generated by their models. This research combines plant ecology and mathematical modeling, and will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in both disciplines. <br/><br/>The researchers will construct general models predicting life history strategies that maximize fitness measured as life time reproduction or population growth rate. Assuming natural selection selects for genotypes that maximize fitness, optimization models predict optimal life history strategies for various environmental conditions. Specifically, the models will answer the following questions: (1) What resource allocation strategy (growth, storage, reproduction) and dormancy frequency optimizes the fitness of perennial plants under different environmental conditions (nutrient availability, temperature, precipitation)? (2) What are the fitness consequences of rapidly changing environmental conditions? Further, the researchers will use a long term data set on performance of a perennial plant, A. scaphoides, to test the model predictions by asking: (3) Is the magnitude of observed variation in temperature and precipitation sufficient to negatively affect plant fitness?"

While the theoretical understanding of the species concept has advanced greatly, methodologies for the objective delimitation of species remain inefficient.  This study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and Iowa State University will develop new computational tools to make species delimitation more efficient. Their research will also address a central question in biology: What is a species?  This study will use the genus Adansonia (the baobabs) as a testing ground for these methods. Baobabs are iconic trees of great cultural, ecological, and economic importance in Madagascar, continental Africa, and northwestern Australia, and are also a microcosm for many of the challenges that arise in species delimitation. The work will train undergraduate researchers, K-12 teachers, graduate students, and a postdoctoral associate at the interface of taxonomy, genomics, and computational statistics and provide several opportunities to establish international collaboration. Together, this research will provide new insights into Adansonia systematics and provide a new framework to facilitate species delimitation in diverse groups.<br/><br/>Species delimitation encompasses diverse methods that use genetic, morphological and other trait data to guide taxonomic grouping (placing organisms in hierarchically nested taxa) and ranking (deciding where taxa sit relative to the transition from tree-like relationships at higher levels to reticulate genealogies within populations). Species delimitation remains challenging in many groups due to polyploidy, introgression, and/or species with complex geographic patterns of morphological variation. However, opportunities for progress are offered by recent advances in high throughput sequencing technologies that facilitate rapid acquisition of multilocus DNA sequence data, and by new analytical methods for species level taxonomic problems. Using baobabs as a model, this study will develop a rapid and efficient experimental protocol using sequence capture technology and next-generation sequencing that will allow the application of different species delimitation methods. In addition to deploying existing analytical methods, the researchers will extend the Bayesian Phylogenetics and Phylogeography (BPP) method to formally incorporate morphology and geography. Further, they will add capability to the software program BUCKy for identifying cases where the data imply hybridization or introgression that could be applied in diverse groups of organisms."

Healthy coastal ecosystems are the first line of defense against sea-level rise and storms. Key components of those systems, i.e., barrier islands, intertidal marshes, and lagoons with seagrass, reduce erosion from storms, dampen wind and waves, and absorb flooding waters. Thus, coastal ecosystems protect coastal communities. In addition, these ecosystems provide benefits to society including support for fisheries, recreation, tourism, and sequestration of carbon. Sea-level rise, storms, and temperature extremes cause transitions among landscape components (e.g., changes between uplands to marsh, bare to seagrass-dominated lagoons). These transitions occur on time scales of years to many decades and influence the benefits of coastal ecosystems. The vast Virginia Coast Reserve is the greatest expanse of undeveloped coastline along the U.S. Atlantic seaboard. It provides a unique setting to understand the dynamics of long-term coastal change. This model system makes it possible to examine linkages among islands, lagoons, mudflats, marshes, and uplands. Such linkages can rarely be made in other regions where habitat fragmentation and human activities disrupt natural connections. Understanding these ecosystem transitions individually, and how changes propagate across the landscape through linked dynamics is a critical frontier in predicting the long-term response of coastal systems to significant environmental change. This project synthesizes long-term observations and experimental data with shorter-term studies to provide novel insights on ecosystem dynamics. These data promote the development and testing of mechanistic models that can predict landscape level change and its ecological consequences. With more than half the world's population living within 100 km of the coast, and even more depending on coastal resources, ecosystem changes in these regions have important consequences for coastal resilience. The VCR LTER program informs coastal management, restoration, and conservation to enhance coastal resilience to environmental changes through partnerships with management agencies and The Nature Conservancy. It contributes extensively to the training of Virginia teachers and the development of educational and outreach materials that reach national and international audiences. Finally, it supports the research training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The program networks with other LTER sites along the Atlantic coast to provide a larger perspective on the eastern seaboard to managers, teachers, and students.<br/><br/>VCR research advances this understanding through integrated studies of the ecological and physical (geomorphic, hydrologic) processes that drive ecosystem state change dynamics. Changes may be linear, or they may involve thresholds (tipping points) that lead to an abrupt, non-linear transition to a different ecological state. Addressing the complexity and interdependence of landscape components is critical to achieving a holistic understanding of coastal dynamics and will advance general theory on ecosystem state change and resilience. Research activities at VCR are organized around four related thematic questions: (1) Drivers and Patterns of Long-term Change: How have the distribution, spatial extent, and characteristics of ecosystems changed over time and how are these changes related to climate trends and variability? (2) Dynamics within Landscape Units: How do ecological and physical processes interact to maintain ecosystem states or facilitate transitions to new ones? (3) Dynamics between Landscape Units: How does connectivity influence ecosystem state change? (4) Ecological Consequences of State Change: What are the consequences of ecosystem state change for ecosystem function? VCR research focuses on carbon sequestration and habitat provisioning as two functions that are linked to important coastal ecosystem services. Collectively, this research will increase our predictive understanding of how coastal ecosystems and their functions respond to climate forcing at multiple spatial, temporal, and ecological scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the roles they play in aquatic systems, and their popularity as a lure for fishing, many important biological aspects of this insect group remain unanswered. It is not known how the different branches on the mayfly tree of life fit together, and therefore the implications of their phylogenetic history are unclear. For example, it is uncertain if the first mayflies had movable or immobile gills running along their backs. Deciphering these patterns could provide insights into the evolution of insect wings and whether they came from ancient movable gill-like structures or not. This project will improve our knowledge of this important insect group by creating a diverse collection of species located around the world, from different aquatic habitats and environments. The morphology and genomics of these insects will be studied in greater detail than before, to understand their evolutionary history and adaptations. Outcomes of this project will further research in stream ecology, and water pollution, as mayflies are a key indicator of the health of aquatic environment.<br/><br/>The lack of a robust mayfly phylogeny has limited the ability of researchers to test hypotheses concerning evolutionary adaptations. This project will enhance the understanding of mayfly phylogeny and evolution using novel and transformative methods to elucidate relationships and morphological during the history of the group. This project will reconstruct a robust mayfly phylogeny, using next generation sequencing methods and phylogenomic analyses, to better understand morphological and genetic trends within mayflies and gain insights regarding evolutionary adaptations. This project will provide excellent research opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in meaningful scholarly and creative activities. This will be accomplished by carrying out smaller research projects on a subset of mayfly taxa (e.g., a family or superfamily), which will ultimately contribute to the comprehensive phylogeny for the order. Students will be mentored in all phases of phylogenetic research, from collecting, generating data, analyzing data, and communicating results at scientific meetings, in publications, and in outreach efforts to the community. Thus, the main outcomes of the project will be: 1) increase in knowledge of mayfly evolution and phylogenetics; 2) opportunities for undergraduate evolutionary research; 3) development of state-of-the-art curriculum for the primarily undergraduate institution Utah Valley University; 4) partnerships with local public schools; 5) establishment of a strong international collaborative network in mayfly research; including coordinating efforts to contribute to efforts such as the online database Encyclopedia of Life, which provides species-level information to serve the scientific community, educators, and the general public; and 6) significant positive impact on the institution and the researcher's career."

Pinpointing these genetic mutations and understanding the environmental conditions that favor changes in breeding system are of great interest to both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders. The plant genus Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae) is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and is a model to better understand the evolution of breeding strategies in plants. Among the 32 species of Schiedea, some only breed with other individuals of the same species, others only self-fertilize, and others still are transitional between the two. Additionally, different outbreeding species of Schiedea use different pollinators, including a recently discovered moth found only in Hawaii. This project will apply cutting-edge DNA sequencing and analysis methods to reconstruct the genealogy of Scheidea and investigate the evolution of plant breeding strategies within the group. Data from this project will provide new insights into the evolution of plant breeding strategies that could be applied to crop species in the carnation family, including amaranth, rhubarb, quinoa and spinach. The project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The project will produce educational videos about Hawaiian plants for posting on the internet to inform the public. Researchers will also offer public seminars about Schiedea highlighting their research findings about the group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to reconstruct the pattern of breeding system evolution in Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) through an integrated program of field, laboratory, and genomic studies. Nuclear genome sequencing, targeted sequence capture, and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) methods will be used to reconstruct a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Schiedea, identify sources of phylogenetic conflict, and investigate patterns of introgression among taxa. The phylogenetic hypotheses developed will be used to interpret the evolution of breeding systems including transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy, shifts from biotic to abiotic pollination, and traits associated with pollination biology (including scent and nectar production). Field studies and densely distributed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers generated by GBS will be used to test hypotheses concerning the influence of reproductive systems on gene flow, hybridization, and population genetic structure.

This project builds on decades of research in North Inlet estuary in South Carolina on the productivity of salt marsh cord grass that have led to new insights about the regulation of marsh productivity and the feedbacks that maintain salt marshes in equilibrium with sea level.  This research is important because sea level is rising at an accelerating rate and threatens to drown these ecosystems.  This project will employ a combination of experiments and field observations to understand how increasing cord grass root growth impacts the elevation of the marsh surface as sea level rises.  Fertilizer additions will be used to increase root growth and test the hypothesis that this will allow the marsh surface to rise.  These manipulations to simulate changing marsh elevations will provide a direct test of how relative elevation affects plant growth. This research will further development of an important management tool, the Marsh Equilibrium Model, for coastal resource managers.<br/><br/>LTREB research at North Inlet has included monthly measurements on permanent plots of stem counts and heights of marsh cord grass (Spartina alterniflora) made since 1984 and supplemented by monthly measurements of porewater chemistry, snail density, and marsh surface elevation.  A synthesis of these data has led to the development of a marsh equilibrium theory and the Marsh Equilibrium Model describing how feedbacks among plants, nutrients, tidal flooding, and sediments move a marsh toward an equilibrium with sea level.  During the next five years this project will continue development of theory, continue collection of primary data, and conduct experimental manipulations to test the importance of plant roots and nutrients on marsh elevation.  It is hypothesized that nutrient additions will increase the growth of roots and thereby raise the equilibrium marsh elevation.  A resumption of nitrogen and phosphorus treatments in field plots, with before and after computed tomography scans of sediment cores, coupled with measurements of marsh surface elevation will test the effects of nutrients on the relative importance of belowground production and sediment trapping to vertical accretion.  Bioassay experiments using marsh organs will directly test the productivity-elevation hypothesis and will be conducted in parallel with the field observations. The broader impacts of this project extend to the public through talks given about sea level rise and marshes to civic groups, discussions with policy makers, and participation in policy forums. Graduate student training and use of the long-term fertilization and census plots in the salt marsh at North Inlet by visiting scholars will be supported."

New mathematical models will be developed to predict how temperature effects on the biochemistry and physiology of individual organisms translate into species interactions that in turn generate the large-scale of patterns of biodiversity that we observe in nature. The resulting intellectual challenge requires integration across several subfields within biology and across biology and mathematics. At the same time, the research has tremendous societal consequences.  Results will inform the biological control of pests and pathogens, which, either in isolation or combined with an integrated pest management scheme, reduces pesticide use and minimizes pollution of water sources and associated health risks to humans and livestock.

It will train students and postdoctoral researchers to develop rigorous, quantitative approaches to address environmental problems and, in so doing, to advance the conceptual boundaries of ecology and evolutionary biology significantly.<br/>  <br/>A sophisticated approach will be used to tackle these intellectual and societal challenges. Four innovative components will be integrated to investigate the mechanisms by which temperature affects both the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species interactions.  First, new theory will build on the first principles of thermodynamics to predict temperature effects on biochemical processes, such as reaction kinetics, that underlie important life history traits. These predictions will then be incorporated into delay-differential population models that realistically capture the key characteristics of ectotherm life cycles.  Second, models for both population dynamics and species interactions will be parameterized with experimental data generated by laboratory manipulations. Third, models and their  predictions will be validated by comparing outputs to abundance data collected over time in natural populations. The final component will use quantitative genetics methods to determine how temperature effects on ecological traits, measured as reaction norms, influence the evolution of thermal responses.  These individual components will be integrated, via eco-evolutionary models, to predict how perturbations to the thermal environment (e.g., climate change) influence population persistence and species coexistence under ecological dynamics alone (the case if species are unable to adapt to changes in the thermal environment or cannot do so fast enough) and under eco-evolutionary dynamics (the case when perturbations lead to rapid evolution of thermal responses of key life history and interaction traits). Results will significantly advance general understanding of organisms' abilities to respond adaptively to rapid environmental change."

Vernal pools, which are temporary wetlands that are inundated in spring and dry in summer, represent discrete, high diversity habitat patches for plants that are able to tolerate extreme physical conditions.  The project examines naturally occurring and restored pools that vary in size, connectivity, and seeding treatment in order to identify the relative importance of local and regional factors affecting local species composition.  Over the next five years, data collected on the abundance of all observed species, pollinator dynamics, seed set, germination rates, and pool hydrology will be integrated into mathematical models to determine factors that significantly influence plant species composition, community dynamics, and long-term stability.<br/><br/>To restore and manage natural communities effectively, ecologists must understand processes affecting their formation and dynamics. When restored ecosystems reach alternative states that do not match conservation priorities, active management is necessary to modify factors controlling the structure and composition of these communities. This field study will generate data critical to inform conservation and restoration efforts. These results will also mitigate endangered species losses on Department of Defense lands. Rural school students will participate in the project by designing and implementing their own research.

Microbes are of particular interest because, unlike most animals and plants, they can survive very long periods of extreme conditions. Therefore, it is possible that some microbes in permafrost are not fossils but are still alive -- essentially, living fossils. This research addresses an unresolved question of whether microbes embedded in permafrost are extinct, representing ancient terrestrial surface or marine communities preserved through time, or actively living communities that have been evolving since being buried. To determine how long microbial communities can live in permafrost, this project will study permafrost collected from the oldest known sediments of the Northern Hemisphere, which occur in Siberia. These intriguing marine and lake sediments are five thousand to three million years old and are found in stratified cliffs. This project will help scientists understand how biological communities respond to large changes in the environment, and its results will be shared with university students and high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>This five year project will document evolution of taxonomic, genetic and functional biodiversity over time using state of the art ""omic"" approaches combined with single cell genomic, cultivation studies and physical-chemical characterization of permafrost sediments. One of the key challenges of this project will be the application of evolutionary models to the DNA sequence datasets to distinguish between permafrost strata containing fossil archive models versus contemporary community models. The data will elucidate evolutionary mechanisms that shape taxonomic, genetic and functional diversity, providing insight into genome evolution and microbial adaptation to low temperatures. Functional, population genetic and phylogenetic approaches will be integrated. The international nature of this project provides a platform to expand a network of collaborative permafrost research with open system data management and sharing. This project will train scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels, and engage high school teachers through molecular biology workshops. Interaction with Russian collaborators and travel to the Siberian study sites will promote international cooperation and provide training to students in how to conduct research with colleagues from different cultures."

A growing fraction of forest conversion and other land placed into agricultural production is associated with commodities produced for global markets. Much of the demand for food that was historically met by local agriculture is increasingly being met by global trade; in the past three decades food exports have increased 10-fold. This project will quantify and model this type of global scale connection that links natural and human systems by studying how agricultural markets and land use in China and Brazil are linked via commodity trade. The natural environment is incorporated in this model in two ways: first, the local land use choices affect soil quality and water, which in turn affects subsequent agricultural choices; second, the expansion of agriculture into tropical forest has an effect on global climate and biodiversity. The models produced by this project will increase our understanding of how human and natural systems change in concert even when the connections are over great distances (telecoupled). This project is a first effort to quantify complex dynamics of distantly coupled agricultural and economic systems by going beyond the traditional focus on a single system, one-way impacts, or comparative analysis of systems. It represents an exciting new frontier of research in coupled systems, with substantial contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of telecoupled systems. The work is of further importance in providing a broader view and new perspective on international commodity trade, which is in the national interest, and in training the next generation of scientists<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to quantify the telecoupling framework to address fundamental questions about human and natural systems such as: What are the effects of telecouplings on human-nature dynamics across scales in distant systems? How do telecouplings and local couplings enhance or offset each other in terms of their effects on human-nature dynamics?  To address these questions and associated hypotheses, the project will focus on major telecouplings involving the trade of agricultural products (e.g., soybeans for food and animal feed) between Brazil and China, two of the world's most important emerging economies. These two countries constitute an excellent example of telecoupled systems, but little is known about the effects of their rapidly increasing trade on human-nature dynamics. By leveraging existing remote sensing and socioeconomic data and collecting complementary new data, researchers will model complex dynamics and relationships among key components of telecoupled systems. Analyses at the international and national scales will be conducted with the widely used Global Trade Analysis Project model. They will be complemented by in-depth studies at the regional and local scales through ecological fieldwork and socioeconomic surveys, as well as through developing and validating a telecoupled agent-based model. These studies, spanning local to international scales, will be joined via systems integration."

However, our ability to predict and manage the effect of predator loss or introduction on prey populations on ecosystems remains limited.  This study will integrate experimental and mathematical approaches to improve existing tools for predicting the consequences of predator loss or introduction in aquatic ecosystems. The investigators will conduct a series of observations and experiments in rock pools in streams to document the responses of prey to changes to multiple predator populations. The responses include patterns of prey mortality, and alterations in prey behavior or morphology. The data generated from this phase of the study will be used to test the ability of existing and improved models to predict the long- term consequences of predators on prey populations and overall ecosystem function.  Collectively, the results of this research will significantly advance our ability to predict the consequences of predator loss or invasion. The project will also integrate education with outreach activities in two ways: 1) The investigators will partner with high school teachers to create teaching modules and field labs focusing on predator-prey interactions. 2) The investigators will participate as mentors in a faculty-mentoring network (NSF-Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis project). This network provides support to K-12 teachers and college faculty around the country seeking to implement more rigorous quantitative components in their courses. Additionally, the study will provide research training for post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students.  This project will support an early career investigator, and two investigators at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>This research will advance our ability to predict how predator loss or introduction affect prey populations and influence other ecosystem functions by focusing on the overall effect of multiple predators.

This research project will inventory terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), spiders, and vertebrate parasites of this large tropical island. Field teams composed of specialists on each of these taxonomic groups will survey 10 major mountains on Sulawesi over the course of five field seasons. By thoroughly sampling this island now while some forest remains fully intact and depositing these collections in natural history museums, the raw materials (specimens) supporting the study of tropical diversification will be made available to this and future generations of biological researchers. This project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and technicians from US and Indonesian research institutions in biotic survey research. Senior Indonesian scientists will aid US researchers in a collaborative analysis of specimens. The research team will organize two workshops primarily oriented around molecular genetic data collection and analysis, including high-throughput sequence data, and corresponding population genetic, phylogenetic, and biogeographical analysis. <br/><br/>Sulawesi is characterized by a highly endemic biota, resulting from its large size, geographic setting, long period of isolation from all other land masses, and complex tectonic history. The island exhibits substantial topographical relief, with vast areas over 1000 m above sea level, 20 summits greater than 2500 m in height, and six summits above 3000 m. It probably has never been connected to the more proximate Sunda continental shelf to its west, nor with the more distant Sahul Shelf (New Guinea, Australia, and their land-bridge islands) to its east, and thus has been isolated for its entire history of 20-25 million years. Sulawesi is a composite island composed of at least five paleo-islands that were distantly separated from one another for several million years before merging more or less simultaneously between 10 and 5 million years ago. The composite nature of the island has been strongly implicated in the process of in situ species diversification on Sulawesi. Field sites for biotic survey work were selected to allow thorough sampling of the four arms of Sulawesi as well as its Central Core. A major focus of the program will be sampling along elevational transects on the largest mountains of each Area of Endemism, thereby enabling transects that reach >2500 m in elevation. None of the focal taxa targeted here have been sampled adequately from high elevation sites. The scientific value of the proposed field efforts are considerable and fall broadly into the following themes: (1) documentation of biodiversity, including species and their distributions, evolutionary and population genetic relationships and affinities, and the chronology and geological context of species and community diversification, (2) conservation biology, including documentation of disease outbreak and response, invasive species, and extinction, and (3) understanding of interesting evolutionary processes, including adaptive radiation, hybridization, ecological opportunity, and the genetic basis of biological innovation."

Nectar is an interesting place for such organisms to live because it doesn't last long -- most flowers last only a few days.  Yet, each flower can be home to a complex and changing ""community"" of yeast and bacteria; they are miniature ecosystems. Scientists will conduct experiments to explore how those micro-organisms get into nectar and whether the order in which they arrive determines the final set that end up living there.  Because each flower contains its own separate ecosystem that can be easily tweaked by scientists, this study system is a good one for understanding how ecosystems of all sizes may develop.  Such understanding is important when trying to help preserve rare species and to keep ecosystems functioning in ways that benefit both humans and wildlife.  In this project, for example, the particular set of yeast and bacteria that end up in flowers may have a large impact on what pollinators visit flowers and thus on how effectively the flowers are pollinated.  Given that a lot of what humans eat depends on pollination of crops, understanding what can lead to more effective pollination has both economic and social relevance.

Both sexes defend territories from intruders, which often take them by force. About one-third of all male takeovers are fatal for the displaced breeder; females seldom fight to the death. Current theory predicts that lethal battles should be frequent in short lived animals because they have few reproductive opportunities, but organisms such as loons should never fight to the death because they are long-lived and territories are plentiful. Over the course of ten years, the project is testing three hypotheses to account for fatal fighting: 1) fatal battles constitute a 'terminal investment' for old, declining males, 2) males that fight to the death defend chicks well, which offsets their hyper-aggressiveness, and 3) extreme familiarity with a territory causes fatal battles. To test these hypotheses, the researchers follow and observe a large number of marked individuals, measure body mass of captured loons, and analyze territorial fights, usurpations and survival patterns across time. <br/><br/>Results from this study will help scientists understand lethal contests in animals, aggressive behavior, and the process of aging. Though loons are common within their range, they are considered of special concern by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and are declining across their range.

Diatoms possess a broad range of novel traits that, together, have facilitated their rise to prominence in the world's oceans. Ultimately, this project will reveal how nature has assembled the mosaic genomes of one of the world's most diverse and ecologically important lineages."

Yet, it is likely that interactions between ecology and evolution are key to generating biological diversity. This project will study toxic algal blooms to understand how links between ecological and evolutionary processes shape biodiversity. The last decade has seen amazing advances in genome sequencing technology and biological data analysis. There is now an opportunity to apply this new technology to the study of algae. Algae are important for several reasons. Algae are the primary producers in most ocean and freshwater environments. Algae produce numerous substances including antibiotics and other potential human drugs. Algae also produce toxins that endanger human health and water quality. These toxic algal blooms are increasing in both frequency and severity across the globe. The resources developed as a result of this project will help better predict toxic algal blooms. This project will train undergraduate students in genomics and phylogenetic approaches. Outreach materials focused on the algae in aquarium habitats will also be developed for the Biosphere 2 facility in Arizona.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to study a type of toxic alga called Prymnesium. Prymnesium is abundant in aquatic communities in Texas. The project will focus on study sites in Texas. The project will test the hypothesis that changes in toxicity shape the genetic diversity of Prymnesium populations. To do so, the project will first characterize the diversity of toxic algal blooms through whole genome sequencing of over 100 diverse Prymnesium strains. This will be the largest survey of genomic variation within a natural algal population to date. Second, the project will identify the molecular mechanisms of toxicity using RNA sequencing and network analysis. This approach will overcome the challenge of rapid, accurate identification of genes underlying functional traits. Third, the researchers will integrate the empirical data into mathematical models of eco-evolutionary feedbacks to predict all three dimensions (genetic, phylogenetic, and function) of biodiversity within toxic algal blooms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microbial communities influence the growth, reproduction, and death rates of their hosts. Not all microbes are detrimental; the effects of microbes span the full range from causing deadly disease to being essential for host health. Despite the importance of microbial diversity to host well-being, we have little ability to predict the diversity and composition of microbial communities within hosts. This project will address this knowledge gap by testing whether a mathematical model developed originally for plants and algae ('resource-ratio theory') can be used to understand what determines the diversity and composition of the microbes that inhabit plant hosts. The data from these experiments will be used to understand when the predictions of the resource-ratio model apply to microbial communities and how it can be modified to make better predictions. A deeper understanding of the controls on microbial diversity will lead to more accurate predictions about microbes within hosts, which may speed advances in medicine and agriculture.<br/><br/>The researchers will grow plants in conditions that vary in the supply of critical soil nutrients, and they will manipulate and measure the abundance and diversity of a group of plant viruses that cause one of the most widespread and devastating diseases of cereal crops worldwide (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses; B/CYDV's). Five B/CYD virus species will be used to test the resource-ratio model in a series of growth-chamber and field experiments. In each experiment, they will create a wide range of conditions experienced by the viruses by growing host plants under different resource (nitrogen and phosphorus) supply rates. The researchers will measure viral abundance (titer) within individuals, using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for each virus grown alone and in mixture. They will use viral abundance measurements through time to estimate virus population growth rates. The resource-ratio model will be tested with lab experiments, in order to predict viral diversity in each host. The resource-ratio model will also be modified to include elements of the virus and host biology that could cause deviations from the classic theory, such as host defences against infection by microbes and microbial effects on host nutrient content. To test the relevance of this model to more complex natural communities, the researchers will collect data on B/CYDV titers in field experiments replicated at a local field site and in 30 grasslands spanning 5 continents."

Studies of local adaptation have historically focused on geographically separated populations, where adaptive differences are maintained by limited dispersal of individuals between populations. Growing evidence, however, suggests that adaptive evolution can occur over small spatial distances. How this fine scale, adaptation arises and is maintained remains unresolved, despite applications for human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. On Santa Cruz Island, the Island Scrub Jay has two morphologies. Birds in pine habitat have long and thin beaks where as those in oak habitats have short and deep beaks. These differences are known to facilitate feeding on pine cones versus acorns, but how such adaptive genetic differences are maintained over very small geographic distances is unknown. The researchers will collect data on the genomes of individuals from both types of habitats to test if the same set of genes are differentiated between pine and oak populations, and how other regions of the genome change spatially across the island. These measurements will be coupled with telemetry studies that track how birds move and use oak and pine habitats. In addition, vocal experiments will test if males prefer females that originate within their habitat. The data obtained from this work will then be used to develop general models that can inform the conditions under with adaptive differences in can occur. Such models would be of interest to conservation managers that manage this and other unique or rare species. Additionally, the project will produce a learning module for high school classroom use, and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cases of microgeographic adaptation challenge classical evolutionary theory that posits adaptive divergence should be constrained by gene flow, leading to a reassessment of the spatial scale at which evolutionary processes occur. The research team has recently discovered replicated, adaptive divergence in jay bill shape in adjacent oak and pine habitats, despite gene flow between these adjacent habitats. This pattern occurs across habitats separated by less than one kilometer. The researchers will test alternative hypotheses about how divergent selection, dispersal, and non-random mating shape adaptive divergence in bill morphology. In Aim 1, they develop population genetic models that test the interacting effects of selection, gene flow, assortative mating, and genetic architecture at different spatial scales. In Aim 2, they will test for divergent selection by measuring selection gradients, examining patterns of genomic divergence, and by identifying candidate genes associated with variation in bill morphology. In Aim 3, they will use a combination of population genomics, telemetry, and transplant experiments to test for population genomic structure and if dispersal is non-random In Aim 4, they will test if divergence in bill morphology is correlated with vocalizations and facilitates assortative mating. Collectively, the proposed work takes an integrative approach in a tractable study system. This research has broad implications for understanding both the spatial scale at which adaptive divergence occurs, and the conditions that allow individuals within a single population to diverge across heterogeneous habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We still know very little about the biodiversity of microbes, though extending our knowledge has the potential to advance the national interest in relation to ecosystem health. This project focuses on one group of microbes, namely the testate (shelled) amoebae, which are abundant and top predators in New England bogs and fens. Testate amoebae have a rich history of classification based on the shape and composition of their tests (shells); yet these traits have been shown to be misleading in relation to their identification, because there are many cryptic species. Hence, this research project relies on molecular tools to explore their biodiversity across time and space. Such studies are important given that testate amoebae serve as markers for changing climates and are abundant in threatened wetland habitats like bogs and fens. Beyond scientific discovery, this research project will train a group of undergraduate women plus a postdoctoral fellow on the biodiversity of microorganisms. <br/><br/>Testate amoebae have been used as bioindicators in both paleoecological and contemporary studies, and some taxa are argued to be top predators in Sphagnum dominated habitats.  This research project will illuminate the diversity of testate amoebae from bogs and fens within New England and across seasons.  Comparison of morphological and phylogenetic species, defined initially based on two molecular markers and then by multilocus delineation through transcriptome analyses, will allow exploration of the biodiversity of this clade.  The work will probe the ecological factors that drive the distribution of testate amoebae by assessing fine (local) and larger (New England) scale variation.  Patterns among community members will also be characterized using high-throughput sequencing of target regions in the genome, which allows detection of rare community members.  This research will generate images of testate amoebae, gene sequence data, alignments, phylogenies, and transcriptomes (i.e. expressed genes) from a poorly studied clade of eukaryotes, all of which will be made available to the community.

Given that almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination, there is concern that many plants will decline towards extinction alongside their pollinators. Pollination is important because it ensures that plants can make seeds, grow into new plants and keep the species going. Yet, there are many reasons to think that the link between declining numbers of plants and declining numbers of pollinators is not so simple. For example, although it makes sense that a plant would make fewer seeds when there are fewer pollinators around, fewer seeds do not necessarily mean fewer new plants if, for example, the new plants compete for places to live. Fewer seeds could actually result in less competition among new plants, allowing more of them to survive. Furthermore, plants may use other resources not devoted to making seeds to grow larger and survive longer, thus having more chances to reproduce within their lifetime. These examples illustrate how, despite making fewer seeds, enough new plants could be made to keep the species going. A bigger lesson is that ecology is complex; all sorts of hidden strategies are not apparent until you take a closer look. This project will follow the fates of thousands of plants that are exposed to different numbers of pollinators, thereby helping scientists to identify plant species most at risk from pollinator declines and to understand why others are or are not at risk. In addition to data collection, the scientists on this project will help train the next generation of ecologists and will engage the public through an educational film, a blog, and a permanent interactive exhibit.<br/>  <br/>Individual-based population models (integral projection models) will be parameterized with data from a field experiment in which five species of perennial plants receive different pollination treatments: (i) increased pollination, (ii) reduced pollination, (iii) interannually variable pollination, and (iv) an unmanipulated control. All plants will be tagged with a unique identification number and their demographic status assessed annually. Additional germination experiments will be used to parameterize the effect of pollination on recruitment through density-dependent germination and seedling survival. Projections of the population models will show the consequences of pollination for plant population dynamics. Finally, life table response experiments will elucidate specific life history mechanisms by which pollination does or does not affect plant population growth rates (e.g., via trade-offs between growth and reproduction). This project will provide the empirical evidence necessary to bridge conceptual gaps among pollination biology, life history theory, and population dynamics, as well as providing a framework for understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of pollinator declines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to understand the role of foraging and aggressive behavior in determining hurricane survival in the honey bees of Puerto Rico. Africanized bees invaded Puerto Rico in the 1950's, initially creating highly aggressive populations as has occurred elsewhere. Since their introduction, the Africanized bees of Puerto Rico have uniquely become less aggressive over time, as evidenced by a wealth of pre-hurricane genetic and behavioral data. This project addresses the hypothesis that storms, such as Hurricane Maria that hit Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017, select against more aggressive colonies and favor bees that invest more in foraging and food hoarding. The researchers will test this hypothesis by sampling the remaining post-hurricane populations and comparing them with the pre-hurricane data. RAPID funding will provide the opportunity to study both genetic and behavioral traits of survivors and their offspring within the months immediately following the storm. The study of a population's response subsequent to major environmental and anthropogenic disturbances is of importance to the understanding of processes that shape natural and agricultural ecosystems. This project will also support Puerto Rican students to maintain research productivity in a lab severely damaged by the hurricane. <br/><br/>The genomes of bees from post-Hurricane Maria wild populations and domestic populations will be sequenced and analyzed to determine signatures of selection or genetic bottleneck by comparing them with pre-hurricane genotypes. Polymorphic markers across the genome will be used to test a larger number (>1500) of specimens over a greater geographic area (i.e. Puerto Rico) to examine evolutionary trends and processes.  Comparisons of genetics, genomics and behavior of pre- and post-hurricane, feral and domesticated populations will test hypotheses on role of large disturbances such as hurricanes or anthropogenic influences on reducing aggressive behavior in Africanized honey bees.  Untangling the effects of chance and selective processes on honey bee genomes may identify a novel and general role of environmental disturbance in the evolution of aggressive behavior in colonial organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, as fishermen adapt to these changes by moving across fisheries, their actions may strongly impact them and their communities, as well as influence local ecosystem dynamics. The linkages between environmental variability and ecological, economic, and social outcomes in marine ecosystems are poorly understood. Developing this knowledge is important so that regulators may adopt fisheries management approaches that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental variability while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries and mitigating risks to both ecosystems and livelihoods. In this project, ecologists, economists and social scientists will collaborate and integrate primary survey research, modeling, and outreach to: 1) understand how environmental variability affects, and is affected by, linked social and ecological processes; 2) investigate how more integrated fisheries management can enhance social and ecological resilience; and 3) engage state and federal fisheries managers and fishing communities in the development and application of modeling approaches to better achieve ecological and social goals.<br/><br/>To better operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management, the researchers will use time series approaches to identify the effects of environmental variability on fish population dynamics and spatial distributions, and to identify 'portfolios' of species whose productivity varies synchronously or asynchronously, in the context of the fisheries of the California Current marine ecosystem on the U.S. West Coast. To better understand fishermen's patterns of participation across multiple fisheries, this research will combine data from ethnographic interviews and structured surveys of fishermen, with data on fishing participation, revenues and costs, to develop an empirical model of fishing supply behavior that integrates economic motivations (e.g., profits, financial risks, and outside employment opportunities) with non-monetary considerations (e.g., psychological satisfaction from fishing or strong social ties to the fishing community). Finally, the researchers will integrate the model of fishing supply with models of the population dynamics of key fish stocks under environmental variability to create a coupled ecological-economic simulation model of West Coast fisheries. This model will be used by the researchers, in conjunction with fishery managers and stakeholders, to consider how alternative management approaches may enhance or hamper the resilience of the fishery by affecting fishermen's adaptive behavior. The research from this study would provide society benefits through providing an important tool to operationalize ecosystem-based fishery management, a stated priority for state and federal agencies."

This project studies the timing and success of reproduction in tropical forest plants. Tropical species may use cues of seasonal shifts (for example, in rainfall or light availability) to time the start of reproduction, perhaps to ensure their seeds are dispersed during conditions that will be favorable for the growth and survival of young seedlings. Rainfall, light availability, temperature, and other environmental conditions influence each stage of reproduction- flowering, fruit maturation, seed dispersal, and seedling growth. Beneficial conditions for reproduction can vary within a year, due to seasonality, and among years, due to climate cycles like El Nino. This project focuses on long term data in order to capture periods when conditions are better or worse for various types of plants. The research takes place at multiple tropical forest study sites to separate the effects of local weather variability from large regional climate patterns. By measuring the cues tropical plants use to start reproduction and examining which environmental conditions affect seedling growth and survival, the long-term data from this project will strengthen our ability to predict the future of tropical forests and the benefits these forests confer to society. Training of multiple undergraduate students will occur at the sites, by each of the collaborating universities.<br/><br/>These long-term studies will enable tests of hypotheses concerning: (1) what are the environmental cues that induce flowering; (2) how is reproduction in tropical forests affected by disturbances such as wind storms, droughts, and by natural climate cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which vary at subdecadal to multidecadal time scales;  (3) how do species with different traits (e.g., small vs. large seeds, soft vs. dense wood) respond to environmental variation; and (4) how does episodic reproduction ramify through to the structure of adult populations. This research approach will effectively close the demographic gap between studies of early reproduction and the dynamics of sapling and adult tree populations.

Increases in algal blooms typically include cyanobacteria, which are capable of producing toxins called cyanotoxins. These cyanotoxins are harmful to human health and to other animals that live in or drink water from the lakes. There is little, historical data on algal blooms and cyanotoxins, which makes it difficult to understand how long they have been occurring and what makes them happen. This project will advance our understanding of algal blooms and cyanotoxin occurrence by focusing on the historical record of cyanotoxins that are preserved in the sediments of lakes. There are significant challenges in relating the cyanotoxin in lake sediments to their historic production in the water column of lakes. This EAGER project will develop innovative methods to extract and measure cyanotoxins in lake sediment, and conduct experiments to quantify how the toxins degrade under various environmental conditions. Researchers will then make critical determinations of historic production of these toxins for Lake Harris in Florida. Results from this project will be broadly useful in developing standard methods for the study of cyanotoxins in all lakes and reservoirs, and will provide lake and municipal water managers a new tool to acquire cyanotoxin data on a longer time scale. This project will also provide research training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>While these paleolimnological investigations are providing much needed records of historic cyanotoxin production, it is unknown if changes in paleo-cyanotoxin stratigraphies result from alterations in toxin production, degradation or deposition. As a result, sediment studies incorporating cyanotoxins as a proxy are at risk to incorrectly infer historic toxin production. This research will establish cyanotoxin water-sediment connections, develop innovative analytical protocols, and cutting-edge degradation indices for determining cyanotoxin sediment studies on cylindrospermopsin and microcystin. In addition, results from these experiments will used to verify cyanotoxin deposition with known periods of historic eutrophication and limnological change throughout the Holocene. The objectives of the study are: 1) develop sediment-water column connections for cyanotoxins by matching surface sediment cyanotoxin concentrations with known water column cyanotoxin values and improving extraction methods, 2) determine degradation coefficients for CYN and MC in a variety of sediment types under a range of environmental variables (temperature, oxygen, organic matter content) experienced in lake sediment environments, and 3) identify stratigraphic changes of cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria pigments from sediment cores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these natural ecosystems, the supplies of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from weathering bedrock and deposition in rain and dust are so slow that less than 5% of the annual plant productivity can be met from these external sources. Instead, these ecosystems accumulate nutrients over thousands of years and reuse and recycle them via internal nutrient cycles. This almost exclusive dependence on internally recycled nutrients means that the response of these ecosystems to a changing environment or to disturbance has to rely on a redistribution of nutrients already in the ecosystem, at least for the first few decades. Over hundreds of years, these responses depend on the ability of the ecosystem to retain and recycle more nutrients. This project will compare and contrast various types of ecosystems, from grassland to forest, from tropical to arctic, and develop a general model to describe how these ecosystems accumulate nutrients over time and how their dependence on recycled nutrients affects their responses to a varying climate, elevated carbon dioxide, and disturbances like wildfire, biomass harvest, or storm damage. The study promises to make an important contribution to our understanding of general ecosystem function, which will be valuable to increase understanding of how ecosystems around the world are regulated, how they respond to climate and disturbance, and how they can be managed as a sink for carbon dioxide in the future. It will also increase understanding of how and why ecosystems differ in their stability, resilience to disturbance. Researchers also will develop a teaching module for use in undergraduate courses to allow students to explore nutrient regulation of ecosystems. The model and associated data will be available to researchers and educators on the web and will also serve to link both research and educational programs at the Marine Biological Laboratory. This project will support one full-time post-doctoral scholar and a masters-level research assistant. <br/><br/>This project builds on a theory of resource optimization and element interactions within ecosystems as formulated in the Multiple Element Limitation model, which simulates the optimization of resource acquisition by vegetation and soil microbes, the synchronization of nutrient cycles within ecosystems, and the coupling of these nutrient cycles with energy, carbon, and water fluxes through ecosystems. Through synthesis of existing data and the implementation and analysis of a model of the interactions among carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water in terrestrial ecosystems, this project will examine biogeochemical constraints on responses to climate and disturbance and the consequent effects on carbon sequestration and ecosystem nutrient capital. Resource optimization describes how plants and microbes regulate the acquisition of vital resources to both maintain their metabolic balance and maximize growth. It is through this optimization and the balanced interactions between plants and soil microbes that ecosystems can accumulate vital nutrients and recycle them internally, which in turn allows higher production and carbon sequestration than would otherwise be possible. By comparing and contrasting responses to climate and recovery from disturbance in several different types of terrestrial ecosystem, this project will further advance the theory of resource optimization and element interactions in ecosystems, assess the mechanisms by which tight within-ecosystem nutrient cycles are synchronized, and evaluate the potentials of carbon and nutrient sequestration or loss across the globe."

Nectar is an interesting place for such organisms to live because it doesn't last long -- most flowers last only a few days.  Yet, each flower can be home to a complex and changing ""community"" of yeast and bacteria; they are miniature ecosystems. Scientists will conduct experiments to explore how those micro-organisms get into nectar and whether the order in which they arrive determines the final set that end up living there.  Because each flower contains its own separate ecosystem that can be easily tweaked by scientists, this study system is a good one for understanding how ecosystems of all sizes may develop.  Such understanding is important when trying to help preserve rare species and to keep ecosystems functioning in ways that benefit both humans and wildlife.  In this project, for example, the particular set of yeast and bacteria that end up in flowers may have a large impact on what pollinators visit flowers and thus on how effectively the flowers are pollinated.  Given that a lot of what humans eat depends on pollination of crops, understanding what can lead to more effective pollination has both economic and social relevance.  High-school students will be mentored in research through a 7-week summer research internship. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will help mentor those high school students and be mentored, themselves.  Workshops on bioinformatics will be offered to train students in essential skills of data analysis.<br/><br/>A combination of field observations, field experiments, and laboratory experiments will be conducted on nectar microbes associated with a hummingbird-pollinated shrub in California. Data will be integrated through construction of a simulation model of plant-hummingbird-nectar microbe interactions, providing tests of community assembly theory. Researchers will integrate genetic, phylogenetic and functional dimensions of biodiversity by studying how (1) yeast genetic diversity and bacterial phylogenetic diversity are influenced by flowering phenology, (2) yeast genetic diversity and bacterial phylogenetic diversity suppress each other through antagonistic priority effects within floral nectar, (3) yeast genetic diversity and bacterial phylogenetic diversity alter hummingbirds' foraging preference by modifying nectar chemistry as a result of growth in nectar, thereby affecting functional diversity of flowers in terms of nectar chemistry, pollination success, and seed production, and (4) how functional diversity of flowers feeds back to affect yeast genetic diversity and bacterial phylogenetic diversity via altered dispersal of yeast and bacteria across flowers."

This project studies the timing and success of reproduction in tropical forest plants. Tropical species may use cues of seasonal shifts (for example, in rainfall or light availability) to time the start of reproduction, perhaps to ensure their seeds are dispersed during conditions that will be favorable for the growth and survival of young seedlings. Rainfall, light availability, temperature, and other environmental conditions influence each stage of reproduction- flowering, fruit maturation, seed dispersal, and seedling growth. Beneficial conditions for reproduction can vary within a year, due to seasonality, and among years, due to climate cycles like El Nino. This project focuses on long term data in order to capture periods when conditions are better or worse for various types of plants. The research takes place at multiple tropical forest study sites to separate the effects of local weather variability from large regional climate patterns. By measuring the cues tropical plants use to start reproduction and examining which environmental conditions affect seedling growth and survival, the long-term data from this project will strengthen our ability to predict the future of tropical forests and the benefits these forests confer to society. Training of multiple undergraduate students will occur at the sites, by each of the collaborating universities.<br/><br/>These long-term studies will enable tests of hypotheses concerning: (1) what are the environmental cues that induce flowering; (2) how is reproduction in tropical forests affected by disturbances such as wind storms, droughts, and by natural climate cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which vary at subdecadal to multidecadal time scales;  (3) how do species with different traits (e.g., small vs. large seeds, soft vs. dense wood) respond to environmental variation; and (4) how does episodic reproduction ramify through to the structure of adult populations. This research approach will effectively close the demographic gap between studies of early reproduction and the dynamics of sapling and adult tree populations. At each of the field sites, species-specific flower, fruit and seed rain is recorded multiple times each year using seed traps. Additionally, all woody seedlings are recorded in an annual census of hundreds of 1-m2 plots adjacent to seed traps, at each site. The trap and plot censuses take place within large mapped forest dynamics plots where all trees >1 cm in diameter are identified and regularly measured.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using a functional traits approach, manipulative field experiments will be used to determine species responses to disturbances (burning, mowing), winter conditions (snow depth), and their interactions, on species persistence, establishment, and community stability. This work examines the importance of freeze tolerance as a persistence related trait and tests the hypothesis that fire regimes are beneficial to preserving grassland diversity through their selection of stress-tolerant plants and influence on plant establishment and colonization rates.

Previous results document the effects of predators on small mammals and plants that were overwhelmed by El Nio&#8208;associated rainfall. Based on predictions of more frequent and intense El Nio events as a consequence of ongoing global climate change, the project will emphasize the dual and interactive roles of climate change and invasive species (lagomorphs, numerous ephemeral plants) on community-level dynamics in this habitat. Data collected over the next five years will be analyzed to answer three important questions: 1) will a major El Nio event in the next 5 years reverse the trends that have been apparent since 2002, or has a critical transition occurred that will be stable for the foreseeable future? 2) what further changes may ensue from the apparent decline in perennial shrub cover and an increase in invasive vegetation since 2003? and 3) what will be the consequences of these changes for the north-central Chilean semiarid zone more generally? These goals are facilitated by extensive collaboration with multiple investigators in Chile, Spain, and the United States. This research integrates population, community, and geographical ecology in the context of global climate change and predicted vegetative responses, spans 3 trophic levels, and provides important insight into the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic factors, and top-down versus bottom-up control in semi-arid systems."

This research will fill this gap in knowledge, test many existing hypotheses for the first time, and provide a much-needed synthesis of evolutionary process for plant diversity on the island. Powerful, new sequencing technologies and innovative analyses will be applied to a species-rich plant group, called Megistohibiscus, which has evolved exclusively on the island. Madagascar is also one of the highest priority areas for biodiversity conservation in the world and genomic data collected for this project have the potential to guide conservation decisions and help limit further losses of biodiversity. The research will provide research opportunities for female undergraduate students and underrepresented minorities at Eastern Michigan and provide important training in evolutionary genetics, systematics, bioinformatics, and conservation. One Malagasy graduate student will be involved in the research and a short course will be taught at the country's major university to facilitate international scientific exchange and address the significant shortage of trained local scientists on Madagascar.<br/><br/><br/>This research will synthesize findings from phylogenetic and phylogeographic investigations, information theory and ecological niche modeling to explore the mechanisms that have led to the extraordinary diversification of plants on Madagascar. Because multiple processes have likely contributed to the evolution of the flora, the work will evaluate a full range of evolutionary forces (and assess their relative contributions) in order to identify the most important processes. Speciation hypotheses will be rigorously tested for the first time in Malagasy plants and focus on a morphologically diverse, monophyletic and endemic clade (Megistohibiscus) in an important Malagasy plant family (Malvaceae; tribe Hibisceae). Analyses of genetic data collected via RAD tag Illumina sequencing will identify mechanisms promoting diversification at the species and population level. This research specifically aims to: I) Infer patterns and timing of diversification in Megistohibiscus; II) Integrate phylogenetic, geographic and temporal information to explicitly test models of speciation; III) Explore phylogeographic histories in three endemic genera (Humbertiella, Megistostegium, and Perrierophytum); and IV) Identify, rank and compare demographic processes responsible for population diversification. The resulting taxonomically complete and resolved phylogeny of Megistohibiscus will help delimit species boundaries, revise taxonomy, and provide insights into relationships of the Malagasy flora. A Malagasy Plant Evolution Working Group will be assembled to assess and strategize ways to inspire the future execution of speciation studies in other endemic plant clades to uncover comprehensive patterns of Madagascar's floristic diversity. American undergraduate students and a  student from Madagascar will be trained at Eastern Michigan University, an RUI Institution, in all aspects of the research."

Because compost is generally used as fertilizer, urban agriculture has the potential to recycle nutrients from food waste back into the human food system.  However, the availability of nutrients in compost may not match the nutrient demands of crop production, and imbalanced or excessive application of compost could lead to losses of nutrients through leachate or runoff.  In some cases, urban agriculture could be a contributor to the pollution of groundwater or surface water.  Additionally, changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation have the potential to affect nutrient loss rates from urban farm plots.  Although nutrient dynamics in conventional agriculture have been well studied, little is known about controls on nutrient cycling in urban agriculture, which occurs at a different scale and is subject to different management strategies.  This research will quantify and contextualize the role of urban agriculture on nutrient dynamics within the Twin Cities, Minnesota urban ecosystem.  Project results will be shared with local policy-makers as well as with the scientific community.  Approximately 140 undergraduate students will be engaged in project activities each year through courses, and this project will provide intensive research experiences for approximately 15 undergraduate students and 5 high school interns.<br/><br/>This project will combine data collection from urban farms and community gardens, and experimental manipulations across study plots at the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota.  The observational component will characterize the range and frequency of different soil management techniques, and to assess how these different management strategies result in different levels of nutrient use efficiency and nutrient export.  Researchers will construct nutrient budgets for ten urban farms based on information collected from farm managers on compost application and produce yield, and will collect additional data on soil and leachate nutrient levels.  Additionally, researchers will use a controlled, replicated experiment, using 96 four square meter raised bed plots, to measure the effects of compost type and application rate, and simulated rainfall intensity, on nutrient use efficiency and loss via leachate.  Finally, statistical models based on these results will be used to estimate cumulative nutrient fluxes from urban agriculture at the city scale, under current and future scenarios.<br/>"

However for over 100 years researchers have struggled to explain why no single species can exclude all the others. It is thought that species can coexist only when the ability of each to outcompete the others is limited by something different. For example, they may each need different resources for growth, be infected by or eaten by different things, or need different environmental conditions. However, showing that this idea holds in nature has proven difficult.  This project will build on existing research on plant coexistence in sagebrush steppes. This research shows that the plant species that are most common coexist because of differences in what limits how successful seedlings are at getting established. These differences in establishment are suspected to be caused by differences in the fungal pathogens living in the soil and infecting roots of the different species. In this study, the researchers will use a field experiment, greenhouse experiment, and computer models based on historical and experimental data to find out how big the role of fungal pathogens is in maintaining the coexistence of plant species. The sagebrush steppe that this work will study is an at-risk ecosystem that has economic and conservation importance. This research will be useful to land managers working in these systems, because it will increase understanding of how important native plant species can be helped in their regeneration. Therefore it will lead to improved ways to manage and restore this ecosystem. The results will be used to create fact sheets for use by land managers, and will be made available to them and to others through existing networks of state, federal, university and NGO personnel interested in sagebrush steppe conservation.<br/><br/>Progress in empirical coexistence research requires integration of modern, quantitative approaches such as population modeling, with classical mechanistic approaches such as experiments targeting specific coexistence mechanisms. This proposal combines these approaches by focusing on one potential mechanism that has recently generated tremendous interest and is likely important in perennial vegetation: plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). First, a field experiment will quantify intra- and interspecific effects of fungal PSFs on germination-emergence and establishment. A companion greenhouse experiment will address questions about differences between field and lab-based PSF studies, and place this case study in the context of the current literature. Second, results from the field experiment will be incorporated in an existing, phenomenological multispecies population model, enabling comparisons of the overall stability of coexistence under a scenario in which only PSFs drive interactions at the recruitment stage, and a scenario including all possible sources of intra- and interspecific effects on recruitment. By combining field experiments, greenhouse studies, long-term demographic data, and models, this work will quantify the contribution of PSFs to the overall stability of coexistence in a sagebrush steppe community. This novel experimental and modeling framework can be extended to other communities and coexistence mechanisms in the future."

They inhabit most of the world's environments, where they perform numerous functions (e.g., nutrient cycling, foundations of food webs, etc.) that are central to healthy ecosystems. Importantly, fungi interact with all other forms of life, including plants, animals and bacteria -- in associations that range from beneficial to antagonistic. Zygomycete fungi, the focus of this research project, are an ancient group in which most of the morphological and ecological traits associated with Kingdom Fungi first arose, but their evolutionary history and ecological associations have not yet been well resolved. This project will reconstruct the genealogical relationships of this earliest branch in fungal evolutionary history, resolve the origins of symbiotic relationships between plants and zygomycetes, reveal how complex body plans evolved in the group, elucidate mechanisms of mating genetics between organisms with complex and differing life cycles, and develop genomic barcodes to facilitate identification of unknown fungi. The results of this research will contribute to many scientific disciplines and to society. Expanding and maintaining expertise on these fungi is critical for the field of biology, human health and productivity, and safe food production. This project includes training of the next generation of mycologists, dissemination of information on basic fungal biology, development of teaching resources, expansion of biological database and web resources, development of research materials including strain cultures and genomes for the wider scientific community, and broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Zygomycetes are filamentous fungi that lack flagella and that produce simple but defined reproductive structures. An initial analysis of zygomycete genomes support the hypothesis that the group is a pivotal transition point between certain flagellated Fungi and their specific life histories, and what became the dominant eukaryotic terrestrial clade of Fungi (the fleshy fungi, e.g., mushrooms).  Because the zygomycetes are the first terrestrial fungi that exhibit fruiting bodies, understanding how these structures evolved will provide a basis for understanding the origins of complex morphogenesis (e.g., multicellularity) in the Fungi, as well as the evolution of complex life histories.  Zygomycetes also display a diversity of ecological relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), animals (pathogens) and bacteria (endosymbionts). Resolving the phylogenetic origins of these interactions will provide an evolutionary framework for elucidating molecular and biochemical mechanisms that govern these interactions, and in doing so, will have direct impacts on research into natural and managed ecosystems and human welfare.  This research will also refine molecular environmental sampling techniques, resulting in a more accurate census of zygomycete biodiversity, especially in soil ecosystems. By gathering orders of magnitude more genome-scale data and integrating it with biochemical, morphological, subcellular, and fossil data layers, this elusive region of the fungal genealogy of life will be illuminated and will provide a foundation for broad scale biological research."

By definition, however, food webs depict only direct trophic interactions (who eats whom), one of many ways in which species may interact. This project will develop and use the emerging approach of empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) to construct networks showing the realized causal influences between species (interaction webs) for several ecosystems. These interaction webs are network diagrams that quantify the measurable impact of one species on another as they interact in time. The approach is transformative in that it measures impacts that may be propagated indirectly along causal chains. It is unlike current analytical frameworks, because it accommodates the fact that ecological interactions are not constant but change through time, and depend on the broader ecological context (e.g., where the intensity of competition among consumers changes with prey availability). Moreover, this approach can be used to generate dynamic mathematical models of complex ecosystems from real-time field data. This research has immediate value for producing actionable advice for ecological management by identifying the important species in ecosystems, exposing hidden causal chains of indirect effects (e.g. exposing unintended consequences of management decisions), and by providing scientifically sound early warning signs for critical transitions. The results of this work should be critically useful to resource managers and environmental stewards alike. <br/><br/>This project will use the EDM method of Convergent Cross Mapping to identify causal interactions and construct realized influence webs, using data taken from 6 ecosystems spanning 4 biomes: Port Erin Bay, the North Atlantic Ocean, Canada's Experimental Lake Area, and the Chihuahua Desert. These interaction networks will be compared to classical food webs constructed from literature review to test the extent to which food webs depict the most important ecosystem interactions. A cross-system analysis will be done to quantify the type and frequency of non-trophic interactions (e.g. competition versus indirect mutualism), with validation against experimental evidence where possible (e.g. known non-trophic interactions from long-term experiments at two study sites). In addition, the interaction webs will be tested for the ability to identify important nodes and pathways, such as keystone predators and indirect effects resulting from transitive causal chains. Finally, this project will go beyond the classical image of a static ecological network, by acknowledging the reality that interactions are dynamic (i.e. change over time)."

Originally it was thought the loss of wolves would lead to a dramatic increase in the number of elk, which in turn would lead to substantial changes in the willows along the park's streams. It was expected that reintroduction of wolves would cause a rapid restoration of willow communities due declines in elk numbers. However, the first fifteen years of research indicates that the fate of the willow communities is complex, involving interactions among wolves, elk, bison, beavers and available water. This research will focus on how these complex interactions among predators, grazing animals, and local hydrology influence plants on landscapes.  This knowledge forms the scientific foundation for managing rangelands throughout the western United States, and in so doing, enhances human economies throughout the region. The unfolding story of wolves in Yellowstone is of great public interest and will be communicated in the popular media. The researchers will collaborate with park staff in Yellowstone to offer citizen education to four million visitors annually. Data and conclusions will be made easily available to the public, to natural resource managers, and to researchers throughout the United States.  <br/><br/>The extirpation of wolves from Yellowstone National Park at the turn of the century allowed elk populations to increase to levels that degraded vegetation along small streams. Historically abundant willows were eliminated and dam building by beaver ceased. The reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in 1995 caused a dramatic decline in the number of elk grazing on the park?s northern range, creating an unusual opportunity to understand how herbivores influence plant communities. It has been hypothesized that effects of wolves on elk caused a rapid restoration of riparian communities by reducing browsing on willows. The research team has conducted a 15-year, manipulative experiment to test this hypothesis and to understand the roles of herbivory and water availability in controlling willow growth. The experiment found little support for the idea that wolves changed the ecosystem by releasing plants from consumption by elk. Instead, availability of water controlled willow response. The experiment showed that the absence of effects of effects of reduced elk numbers on willows on the northern range is explained by the absence of dam building by beaver, an activity that enhances availability of water for willows. Beavers, in turn, need willows for food and dam building materials. Patchy recovery of willows has allowed beaver to return recently to a few small streams. Dams built on these streams, in turn, may accelerate the recovery of willows. Alternatively, consumption of willows by increasingly abundant bison populations may compete with beavers and prevent them from maintaining dams, preventing widespread willow recovery. Researchers will continue their experiment on willow growth, supplementing it with observations on effects of natural beaver dams on willows to understand how effects of wolves, elk, bison, and beavers act to determine the state of the riparian ecosystem. State-of-the-art statistical models will be used to analyze data. Results will have important implications for understanding and managing riparian zones embedded within semi-arid grassland landscapes worldwide."

As such, they represent a treasure trove of information relevant to current environmental problems, such as acid rain, nitrogen deposition, forest growth, and rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The first five years of this decadal project focused primarily on the effect of disturbance and environmental change, including the continued decline in acid rain and the changing climate within the Hubbard Brook Valley.  A number of surprises have emerged, including the disappearance of an early climate change effect on stream water temperature, decreased ice cover duration on Mirror Lake, and the impacts of acid rain on soil chemical changes that are now affecting forest growth.  A major surprise seen from a synthesis and extrapolation of long-term trends in precipitation and stream water chemistry was that a relentless dilution of surface waters is occurring throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley and that surface waters are likely to approximate demineralized (extremely dilute) water in the near future.  This suggests that future baseline conditions may be more dilute than thought for the time before the industrial revolution, apparently because of the depletion of soil nutrients by acid rain and the impacts of federal air pollution regulations on precipitation chemistry.  This has important implications for the structure, function and management of northern hardwood forests and their associated aquatic ecosystems in the near future.

Sages play important ecological roles in a diversity of habitats, including providing food for butterfly and moth larvae, and nectar sources for bees and other pollinators.  This study will reconstruct genealogical relationships among different sage species, and address important questions concerning the evolution of flower shape and pollination mechanisms within the group. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Nebraska at Kearney will be trained in a broad range of morphological and molecular systematic skills, and University of Wisconsin, Madison undergraduate students will gain tropical field biology experience through a planned capstone field course.  Information about Salvia will be disseminated through a project website geared towards professional botanists and sage enthusiasts, while other project data will be presented more broadly through publically-accessible databases. <br/><br/>The ability to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using genome-wide DNA sequence data and powerful computational resources has revolutionized the field of systematics.  These new phylogenies now provide a framework to investigate the different processes that facilitate the diversification of species within a lineage. Salvia (Lamiaceae) has a worldwide distribution and diversified extensively, both in terms of the number of species, and the variety of floral and vegetative morphologies present within the group.  This research will investigate the evolution of the unique staminal feature present in members of the genus, and test whether the origin of this character is correlated with an increase in rates of speciation. Researchers will sample about 650 of the 1000 described Salvia species and use Next Generation Sequencing approaches to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Salvia and close relatives using over 450 nuclear genes and the chloroplast genome. This phylogenetic framework will then be used to determine the timing and biogeographic location of increased rates of speciation within the group. Morphometric analyses of key floral features will then be evaluated within the context of the Salvia phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the evolution of floral features have served as key innovations within the group."

Different kinds of condylarths have been considered to be ancestors or close relatives of certain early lineages of mammals, especially the various groups of hoofed mammals. Recent studies using DNA from living mammals have given us a better understanding of how the different lineages of living mammals evolved, but they have also made the relationships of the condylarths less clear. This research aims to clarify how condylarths are related to other mammals, particularly those lineages that have survived to the present. Because they lived during a time when the various lineages of living mammals appeared in the fossil record, understanding the evolutionary relationships of condylarths to living mammals will help us better understand the origins of different mammal lineages. This will help resolve a longstanding issue as to whether most mammal lineages diversified after the dinosaurs went extinct or well before the dinosaur extinction (as some DNA studies of mammals have proposed). As a result, it will help us understand the reasons why mammals diversified into so many forms that we see today, including our own species.<br/><br/>This study will focus specifically on four topics:  1) the phylogenetic affinities of condylarth taxa to extant mammalian lineages; 2) whether any condylarth families form natural (monophyletic) groups; 3) whether ungulates (hoofed mammals) are a natural group; and 4) how condylarth evolution affects the interpretation of divergence times for various mammal lineages. Data from the skeletal anatomy of condylarths will be combined with morphological and molecular data for a broad range of extant and extinct placental mammals. Parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian methods will be used to evaluate the phylogenetic positions of condylarths, and several new approaches and methods will be used to estimate divergence times. The results will assess the phylogenetic position and taxonomy of condylarth taxa, re-evaluate the significance of condylarths for the origins of placental mammal lineages, and re-evaluate divergence times of extant placental lineages based on condylarth phylogeny."

This pattern holds across all taxonomic groups. This difference in levels of biodiversity has fascinated biologists for hundreds of years. Despite this widespread interest, biologists still debate why there are so many species in the tropics and why most tropical groups of organisms rarely diversify into temperate areas of the planet. Two of the leading hypotheses for the striking difference in biodiversity between tropical and temperate habitats is that tropical climates have been stable for a long time (~30-40 million years), allowing sufficient time for speciation and more species to accumulate, and that the evolution of cold tolerance is inherently difficult and has happened relatively rarely. The latter idea is known as the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis. Even though the idea of niche conservatism makes intuitive sense, the hypothesis has little direct support. This research will provide an explicit test of the factors underlying differences in biodiversity between tropical and temperate regions. This is an important and timely test because it will help us understand how biodiversity evolves, and how we can best conserve that biodiversity. In addition, multiple students at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) will be trained in evolutionary biology, and the work will support a beginning Latino investigator. <br/><br/>Tests of the topical niche conservatism hypothesis have been only correlative in nature. Unfortunately, evolutionary processes other than niche conservatism can also explain these patterns. This research will integrate phenotypic, phylogenetic, genetic, and genomic data to provide the most comprehensive test of the role of niche conservatism, and the ability of organisms to adapt to novel thermal environments, in generating the latitudinal species gradient. The researchers will leverage the species rich, and globally distributed genus Drosophila, to conduct these tests. The project involves (1) the generation of a new genus-wide phylogeny of Drosophila, (2) the analysis of the evolution of thermal performance traits for hundreds of species across the genus, (3) experimental tests of the evolvabilty of the thermal niche in both tropical and temperate Drosophila clades, and (4) the identification and testing of the genes controlling thermal niche evolution. Ultimately, the integration of these data will allow the researchers to make the strongest possible inferences about whether and how tropical niche conservatism is responsible for global diversity gradients, and how species evolve under changing thermal environments."

They virtually never live in isolation in nature; only as part of communities with other microbes. Soil microbial communities are major actors in the Earth's elemental cycles, and their response to environmental change can determine whether microbes help soil to retain more of compounds such as carbon, or whether it will be emitted in gaseous forms. As Earth's environment changes, so does the ability for soil to effectively store carbon, reducing the beneficial ecosystem services that soils provide, and releasing stored carbon gas into the atmosphere. In a 25-year long field experiment ongoing in a temperate forest in central Massachusetts, increases in temperature have resulted in a large loss of soil carbon as carbon dioxide gas. The loss is mostly due to microbes, with periods of soil carbon decay punctuated by changes in microbial community composition. This cyclic nature of soil carbon loss over decades suggests the existence of long-term microbial control over carbon in soil. In this experiment, increases in temperature have negatively affected soil fungi but not bacteria, suggesting that bacteria are adapting to these new environmental conditions, and that further adaptations to long-term environmental stress are possible.  Over time, the quality of carbon compounds has been degraded, and examination of hundreds of bacterial isolates showed that the bacteria from chronically heated soils have an increased ability to metabolize degraded forms of carbon.  Going forward, in this NSF CAREER project, research will examine the ecology and evolution of soil bacteria from the long-term warming experiment, in an effort to better predict the effect of environmental stress on terrestrial ecosystems. By doing much of the research in the classroom setting, this project will also help train the next generation of students in environmental microbiology. <br/><br/>This research is designed to evaluate the central hypothesis that soil bacteria have acquired traits associated with adaptation to decades of chronic increases to soil temperature. The first aim is to directly measure the plasticity of in situ microbial community traits associated with declining soil organic matter quality and quantity over decades of chronic temperature stress. A laboratory incubation experiment will use stable isotope probing to measure temperature sensitivity of microbes associated with soils collected from a long-term warming experiment. The field experiment is an analysis of soils collected from before, during and after the heat is turned off for three months in the long-term study. Measures of different components of biomass and microbial products like enzymes and exopolysaccharides will be made and evaluated for changes due to long-term temperature increases. The second aim is to understand evolutionary adaptation of individual bacteria to long-term warming. Isolates will be screened for traits associated with oligotrophy (adaptation to low quantity substrate) and traits associated with degradation of complex carbon (adaptation to low quality substrate, including lignin analogs). The genomes of a subset of species with ecophysiology data will be sequenced for a study of trait evolution associated with oligotrophy or ability to degrade complex substrates. These organisms will also be part of a common garden experiment in an effort to link genomic features associated with long-term temperature stress to changes in fitness in soils. Altogether, these data will be used to estimate a rate of evolutionary adaptation for microbial parameters important to soil carbon modeling. This project will provide graduate student training in research and teaching, as well as undergraduate and high school student training in microbial physiology, ecology and genomics. Understanding bacterial adaptation might help to explain the non-linear pattern of soil C loss over decades of chronic temperature increase, and would define how environmental controls over the carbon cycle may act in a non-linear over longer time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many settings for disease spread are currently being studied, from schools and workplaces to farms and wild areas. But few systems offer the opportunity to experimentally examine the diverse factors driving disease transmission. Social ant colonies provide a novel experimental approach to manipulate infection and measure disease transmission. In this project, the investigators will seek to understand the role of group size, group complexity, and individual contact networks in driving infectious disease transmission. Historically, linking individual contact patterns with the emergent properties of disease transmission has been limited by logistical constraints. In this research, scientists will use video cameras and ant colonies as a model system to track social interaction networks and follow movement of beneficial, null and pathogenic agents. The project will leverage a general excitement for ants, including public interest in some of their parasites, such as zombie ant fungi, to provide products for diverse stakeholders. These will include comprehensive lesson plans, work modules and experiments on mathematical biology of disease. Videos, computer code, games and statistical packages will also be developed, enabling K-12 teachers and students, university classes, and the broader public, to collect and analyze data on social interactions and pathogen transmission. The Epidemics MOOC (Massive, Open, Online Course) at Pennsylvania State University will disseminate the project to a broad audience. Because the research focuses on understanding the mathematical rules of disease transmission, the results will have direct relevance for humans and provide novel insights into how to manipulate the process of transmission to reduce disease. <br/><br/>Ants have a highly evolved social system. Their colonies have agriculture, waste management, air conditioning, aggressive interactions and food limitation. They also are able to effectively control many diseases. Because ant societies are known to optimize the transmission of resources like sugar and protein while reducing pathogen spread, they will serve as a model system for understanding disease transmission. Using epidemiological, spatial and network models, the research will investigate how a range of agents from positive (food) to negative (pathogens) to null (inert beads) are shuttled around the nest. The study of transmission elements that range from beneficial to virulent will allow the establishment of baseline patterns for scaling transmission as a function of colony size and extrinsic conditions (i.e. physical structure) and will shed new light on the role of infectious processes in structuring societies. Although the study of contact networks is often limited to examining a subset of a population (ignoring contacts with unmeasured individuals), some proxy for the relevant contacts that is easier to measure or to the realized transmission network of some pathogen rather than the full network of potential paths, is needed.  The use of video recording within ant nests will allow high-resolution quantification of contacts; thus enabling a comprehensive study of pathogen transmission as an emergent property of societies. The project will include continuous data recorded on thousands of individuals to study the scaling of transmission as a generic process (i.e. independent of pathogens) and link that transmission to the spread of both beneficial and deleterious elements. Using novel dynamic network models and spatial movement models, the important components of social living that promote disease transmission, and those that reduce its spread will be identified. The role of these components will be verified with targeted knockout experiments that will provide specific insights into controlling destructive ant colonies and general insights into the mechanisms behind social immunity and disease control in humans and other social species."

These mats develop a structure similar to soil through the accumulation of living and dead plants in the canopy.  Whether these roots take up significant water and nutrients, however, has not been measured or even confirmed. The nutrient and water resources that are potentially transferred by the roots may offer a considerable benefit to the health and growth of trees. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will provide funds to examine the exchange of water and nutrients between epiphytic mats and host trees that grow roots underneath the canopy soil. Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are likely to continue to rise, and drought to become more severe. Canopy roots and epiphytes may be crucial to maintaining plant biodiversity in critical habitats, and convey an advantage, especially under conditions where trees become heat-stressed.  Results from this project will significantly improve the effectiveness of ecological restoration plans.  In addition, students including those from underrepresented groups will be involved in this project, gaining valuable experience in scientific research. <br/><br/>This project will assess canopy root activity, canopy water redistribution and physiological and ecological roles of adventitious roots. Three approaches will be used to accomplish these objectives: lab, greenhouse and field experiments. (Need to mention the lab experiments) Greenhouse trials are designed to simulate plant water relations (in a simplified system) between epiphytes and host trees via canopy roots using poplar trees (Populus trichocarpa). Preliminary data show that there is water uptake by canopy roots in this poplar system, and suggest potential bi-directional water flow (i.e. up- and downwards sap flow) within the tree. Data also suggest that trees with canopy roots can mitigate drought conditions by taking up water from epiphyte mats.  Similar procedures will be applied to confirm that these activities also occur under field conditions in Olympic National Park, WA.  There the focus will be on bigleaf maple trees (Acer macrophyllum), which develop canopy roots naturally. Stable isotopes will be used to track water transport from canopy roots to other parts of the tree during different seasons, and to understand the physiological and ecological role of adventitious roots under adverse conditions of water availability.<br/>"

These services are important because most plants are literally rooted in place, with animals providing one of their only opportunities to colonize new places.  Ecologists are especially interested in the relative importance of seed dispersal and pollination.  If, for example, seed dispersal is more important than pollination, then declines in seed disperser populations will have greater ecological impacts than declines in pollinators.  This project will use genetic techniques and field experiments to test the impact of pollinators and seed dispersers on the ability of a tropical tree to grow and survive under conditions near and far from parent trees of the same species.  The researchers will integrate their work with education and sustainable development programs that are designed to improve conservation outcomes in the study area, a biodiversity hotspot in Ecuador. The project will provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, and will use public presentations, websites, film and video to communicate results to the public.<br/><br/>The study design combines correlative data from the field with experiments and molecular analyses to address how seed dispersal mediates the initial pattern of gene flow achieved by pollination and to investigate how patterns of mortality shape the relative contribution of pollen vs. seed dispersal at successive life stages. The particular focus is on how genetic 'uniqueness' of a dispersed seed (i.e., the seed's genotype relative to the existing genetic background of all other seeds nearby) may influence its survival. The study system is an animal-dispersed tropical palm, Oenocarpus bataua, in northwest Ecuador. The working hypotheses are that: (1) long distance seed dispersal will promote gene flow by introducing novel male gametic genotypes into seed pools; (2) after controlling for dispersal distance and density, genetic uniqueness will be associated with increased seed and seedling survival; and, (3) the relative contribution of seed dispersal to realized gene flow will increase across successive life stages. Dispersal kernels will be calculated for both pollen and seeds via molecular analyses. Survival of naturally dispersed seeds will be analyzed in relation to dispersal distance, conspecific density, and genetic uniqueness. A complementary, field-based reciprocal transplant experiment will manipulate genetic uniqueness and dispersal distance of seeds, then provide data on subsequent growth and survival of seedlings. Finally, genetic structure will be compared across multiple age classes, from seed to adult.  Many students will be mentored in research.  Results will be disseminated through a blog and a YouTube channel, and incorporated into a field course."

One need only think of the recent, extreme fire season on the US West Coast for an example of how serious the impacts of fire can be. Predicting where fire will occur and how intense it will be is critical for both human and ecological systems in the future. Fire modules in global biosphere models allow forecasts of fire frequency and intensity. However, incorporating fire into global biosphere models efficiently and accurately remains difficult because global models run at a coarse scale relative to that at which many atmospheric, oceanic, and ecological processes operate. One of the key missing components is realistic fire extinctions. Currently, most global models force fires to go out after some pre-determined interval instead of allowing them to burn for days to months. The extreme fires contribute the majority of the impacts in the Earth system, and capturing their effects is critical to useful predictions. Improving the understanding and representation of fire extinction mechanisms in global fire models may improve predictions of fire occurrence in the Earth system. The broader impacts of this project will be improvements in fire management at field sites and savannas more broadly, and training of postdoctoral associates.<br/><br/>An incomplete understanding of fire extinction forces global fire models to rely either on statistical representations of fire pattern or on local, unscaled assumptions about fire behavior. As a result, fire models diverge wildly, from each other and from reality, in their predictions for past, current, and future fire distributions in the Earth system. In this project, the researcher ask why fires go out, first in savanna ecosystems, where fires are frequent and therefore data plentiful, then expanding into other flammable systems (including coniferous and Mediterranean systems like those in Western North America).  Such data feeds into theoretical generalizations of fire extinction (Phase 1). The team predicts that fire extent will result from interactions between random heterogeneity in fuels/landscapes and underlying topographic, weather, or anthropogenic patterns in the landscape. They will then implement the results of this work into global fire models, beginning with CLM4-DGVM and SPITFIRE-JSBACH and then proceeding more broadly via collaborations with the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 2).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lack of understanding of the interactions among this complex set of processes is a significant contributor to the uncertainty of global carbon budgets. How much carbon do forests take up via photosynthesis? How much do they lose? How do these rates change with an increasing frequency of droughts, floods, or other extreme events? It is impossible to measure the activity of every cell in every leaf on every tree around the world, but recent technological advances have made it possible to get much closer to this ideal than was previously possible. This award uses emerging remote observation technologies, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imaging spectroscopy, which now make it possible to map the two-dimensional distribution of plant nutrients across landscapes and the vertical distribution of leaves throughout a canopy from aircraft and other platforms. These two technologies will be combined to develop three dimensional maps of forest nutrients, then, using sophisticated models of light and photosynthesis, forest carbon uptake will be simulated over time. In addition to scientific advances, this award will train undergraduate and graduate students, will result in educational materials to improve ecological and geographical education, and all data, computer code, and teaching materials will be made publicly available via existing databases.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to answer two critical questions in forest ecology.  First, does a greater diversity of leaf traits (higher functional diversity) increase the photosynthetic production of regions?  And, second, is detailed information about the physical structure of the forest and functional diversity necessary to accurately predict current and future productivity of forests?  Current predictive models of plant productivity assume that knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of forests is not essential to estimating their productivity. Yet empirical studies have shown that this assumption is incorrect. The National Ecological Observatory Network?s Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP), with its fine spatial resolution combined with high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR systems, offers an unprecedented opportunity to measure and understand ecosystem productivity across three-dimensional space and through time. Ultimately, this award will test the hypothesis that detailed information about forest structural and functional diversity is critical to predicting key elements of forest photosynthetic production, including peak growing season and daily cycles of productivity in temperate forest ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, 3-D leaf structure and function reconstructions based on NEON AOP data will be used. Realistic models capable of simulating the light regime in forests will use this structural and functional reconstruction and detailed predictions of the study sites' photosynthetic productivity will be made."

Zygomycete fungi, the focus of this research project, are an ancient group in which most of the morphological and ecological traits associated with Kingdom Fungi first arose, but their evolutionary history and ecological associations have not yet been well resolved. This project will reconstruct the genealogical relationships of this earliest branch in fungal evolutionary history, resolve the origins of symbiotic relationships between plants and zygomycetes, reveal how complex body plans evolved in the group, elucidate mechanisms of mating genetics between organisms with complex and differing life cycles, and develop genomic barcodes to facilitate identification of unknown fungi. The results of this research will contribute to many scientific disciplines and to society. Expanding and maintaining expertise on these fungi is critical for the field of biology, human health and productivity, and safe food production. This project includes training of the next generation of mycologists, dissemination of information on basic fungal biology, development of teaching resources, expansion of biological database and web resources, development of research materials including strain cultures and genomes for the wider scientific community, and broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Zygomycetes are filamentous fungi that lack flagella and that produce simple but defined reproductive structures. An initial analysis of zygomycete genomes support the hypothesis that the group is a pivotal transition point between certain flagellated Fungi and their specific life histories, and what became the dominant eukaryotic terrestrial clade of Fungi (the fleshy fungi, e.g., mushrooms).  Because the zygomycetes are the first terrestrial fungi that exhibit fruiting bodies, understanding how these structures evolved will provide a basis for understanding the origins of complex morphogenesis (e.g., multicellularity) in the Fungi, as well as the evolution of complex life histories.  Zygomycetes also display a diversity of ecological relationships with plants (mycorrhizae), animals (pathogens) and bacteria (endosymbionts). Resolving the phylogenetic origins of these interactions will provide an evolutionary framework for elucidating molecular and biochemical mechanisms that govern these interactions, and in doing so, will have direct impacts on research into natural and managed ecosystems and human welfare.  This research will also refine molecular environmental sampling techniques, resulting in a more accurate census of zygomycete biodiversity, especially in soil ecosystems. By gathering orders of magnitude more genome-scale data and integrating it with biochemical, morphological, subcellular, and fossil data layers, this elusive region of the fungal genealogy of life will be illuminated and will provide a foundation for broad scale biological research."

Field and laboratory work will enable the description of new species, redefine patterns of biodiversity, and provide much-needed comparative material for world-class global collections. Importantly, training and education of US university students is integrated throughout this work. US undergraduate and graduate students will work closely with students from host countries, implementing field research projects under the guidance of team leaders and senior graduate students.

Much is known about how intertidal algae react to natural stresses, but little is known about the natural community of bacteria associated with these algae. Past studies in the laboratory found that some 'seaweeds' disintegrate after removal of their bacteria with antibiotics suggesting these bacteria are essential to the health of their hosts. This research will examine the genetic, taxonomic, and functional aspects of biodiversity of bacteria associated with several 'seaweeds' that are particularly important to the general health of marine ecosystems. The research will determine how these bacteria change with season, position within the intertidal zone and latitudinal range. Stability or change in the bacterial species associated with a host will be examined by studying the particular bacterial genes that are present at different sampling times and by studying host responses to inoculations with particular bacteria. The work will also study whether any bacteria are inhibited by the environmental extremes found across the intertidal zone or over latitude, especially at the southern borders of a host's range where climate change may disturb the bacterial community on the host. Researchers will deposit isolates and voucher specimens into public collections, and, in collaboration with trained citizen scientists, will provide digital access to all algal materials within the University of Maine Herbarium. The multi-faceted data collected during this research will aid studies by other intertidal ecologists.<br/><br/> How macroalgal microbiomes change in space and time is poorly known. Is there a 'cool, wet' versus a 'hot, dry' macroalgal microbiome(s)? If so, how does this affect host function? Here, microbiomes will be characterized over the vertical gradient of the intertidal zone on the Maine shore in differentially zoned species within each of two prominent genera, Fucus (rockweed) and Porphyra (laver). Contemporaneously, a trans-Atlantic study of microbiomes of the mid-zone Porphyra umbilicalis and Fucus vesiculosus will determine whether compositional changes found over an intertidal stress gradient are mirrored over the latitudinal range of mid-zoned species. If so, does this matter? This question will be answered by using shotgun metagenomic analyses to compare the genetic composition with the characterized taxonomic composition of the macroalgal microbiomes. Environmental variation associated with microbiome collections will be measured with in situ sensors and from archival and real time data available from government climate services (e.g., NOAA). The potential to detect changes over historic time will be assessed using herbarium specimens. To study bacteria that are likely to be most critical to normal structure and function of Fucus and Porphyra, the researchers will focus on bacterial isolations from spores and fertilized eggs, aided by flow cytometry and single cell genomics. To establish the criticality of these associations, microbiome-depleted embryos will be inoculated with such bacterial isolates, and the resulting interaction will be investigated by analysis of the host transcriptome with RNA-Seq. The temperature tolerance of key bacterial species (operational taxonomic units) will be established in laboratory experiments. This research will serve as an important trans-Atlantic baseline of the biodiversity of macroalgal microbiomes."

For instance, interactions between pathogens and their hosts influence the stability of natural communities and shape the spread of infectious disease within human populations. Similarly, interactions between plants and pollinators are essential for the proper functioning of natural communities and also for the efficient and economical operation of agricultural systems. For these reasons, predicting how species interactions change over time is important for understanding biological communities, managing agricultural systems, and minimizing infectious disease. Unfortunately, our ability to predict how species interactions change over time is poor, in part because the forces driving evolution of interacting species is not well understood. This research will develop new mathematical and statistical methods for estimating the strength of coevolution, a force long hypothesized to play a key role in the evolution of species interactions. The research will also provide significant opportunities for graduate student training at the interface of mathematics, statistics, computation, and biology and thus contribute to human resource development in STEM. Ultimately, the mathematical and statistical tools developed by the research will be made available to the scientific community through development of free computer software; this software will allow the strength of coevolution to be easily estimated in a broad range biological systems. <br/><br/>Two broad classes of techniques currently exist for inferring the strength of coevolutionary selection in natural populations: (1) Direct techniques that make robust inferences but are limited to specific types of systems and small numbers of populations, and (2) indirect techniques that can be applied to a broad range of systems and large numbers of populations but which provide inferences of questionable robustness. Even under the best case scenario, both techniques generally yield only qualitative results and thus cannot provide crucial quantitative information on the intensity of coevolutionary selection in natural populations. This research will capitalize on recent advances in Bayesian statistics to develop novel methods for estimating parameters of well-established coevolutionary models using data routinely collected as part of broad scale studies of trait matching in species interactions. Once these new statistical methods have been thoroughly tested using simulated data, they will be used to estimate the strength of coevolutionary selection in a textbook example of coevolution - the interaction between toxic newts and their garter snake predators."

This research project will inventory terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), spiders, and vertebrate parasites of this large tropical island. Field teams composed of specialists on each of these taxonomic groups will survey 10 major mountains on Sulawesi over the course of five field seasons. By thoroughly sampling this island now while some forest remains fully intact and depositing these collections in natural history museums, the raw materials (specimens) supporting the study of tropical diversification will be made available to this and future generations of biological researchers. This project includes training of undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and technicians from US and Indonesian research institutions in biotic survey research. Senior Indonesian scientists will aid US researchers in a collaborative analysis of specimens. The research team will organize two workshops primarily oriented around molecular genetic data collection and analysis, including high-throughput sequence data, and corresponding population genetic, phylogenetic, and biogeographical analysis. <br/><br/>Sulawesi is characterized by a highly endemic biota, resulting from its large size, geographic setting, long period of isolation from all other land masses, and complex tectonic history. The island exhibits substantial topographical relief, with vast areas over 1000 m above sea level, 20 summits greater than 2500 m in height, and six summits above 3000 m. It probably has never been connected to the more proximate Sunda continental shelf to its west, nor with the more distant Sahul Shelf (New Guinea, Australia, and their land-bridge islands) to its east, and thus has been isolated for its entire history of 20-25 million years. Sulawesi is a composite island composed of at least five paleo-islands that were distantly separated from one another for several million years before merging more or less simultaneously between 10 and 5 million years ago. The composite nature of the island has been strongly implicated in the process of in situ species diversification on Sulawesi. Field sites for biotic survey work were selected to allow thorough sampling of the four arms of Sulawesi as well as its Central Core. A major focus of the program will be sampling along elevational transects on the largest mountains of each Area of Endemism, thereby enabling transects that reach >2500 m in elevation. None of the focal taxa targeted here have been sampled adequately from high elevation sites. The scientific value of the proposed field efforts are considerable and fall broadly into the following themes: (1) documentation of biodiversity, including species and their distributions, evolutionary and population genetic relationships and affinities, and the chronology and geological context of species and community diversification, (2) conservation biology, including documentation of disease outbreak and response, invasive species, and extinction, and (3) understanding of interesting evolutionary processes, including adaptive radiation, hybridization, ecological opportunity, and the genetic basis of biological innovation."

Understanding how the complex suites of traits associated with domestication are assembled over time is a central but empirically challenging question in evolutionary biology and a topic of critical importance to agriculture, conservation, and human health. Adaptations frequently involve the coordinated change of multiple morphological, physiological, or behavioral characters, and this pattern is especially true with respect to the transformation of wild plants into crops. Domesticated approximately 5000 years ago by Native Americans, this important staple crop has a rich archaeological record and extensive genomic resources. Using cutting-edge DNA sequencing methods, a dataset reflecting the time series covering the domestication period from ancient through contemporary DNA will be developed. The research can provide new perspectives on agriculture and trade by early Native American cultures. Trainees gain international experience at the Centre for GeoGenetics in Copenhagen. A high school genomics curriculum will be developed through a summer internship program at the National Museum of Natural History that directly engages high school students in scientific discovery through initial sequencing of a new plant genome.<br/><br/>Genome-wide studies of ancient DNA have been made possible by recent technological advances and provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the historical genetic sequence of multi-trait adaptation. By following the timing and order with which beneficial genetic changes, and by inference changes in domestication traits, accumulate, the DNA dataset obtained will address a core debate over how fast domestication proceeded and test key predictions from evolutionary theory. Several hundred candidate domestication genes identified through genomic diversity and gene expression studies will be followed over an archaeological time series covering the domestication period.  Using cutting-edge solution-based sequence capture methods to vastly enrich recovery of specific sequences, several hundred of these genes will be genotyped over a time series using sunflower archaeological remains covering the domestication period. By combining this genotypic information with knowledge of gene function, the project will determine which traits evolved earlier during domestication than others and whether those traits share common features. Through integrating the ancient DNA data with existing data on effect sizes, the project will test whether variants associated with large differences in phenotype predominantly appear early or late in the adaptation process. Sunflower is an important crop today, is divergent from its wild relative in many traits, and this genetic study provides a unique opportunity to investigate how and under what conditions different evolutionary forces and genetic phenomena influence the timing and order of beneficial substitutions affecting an integrated set of traits"

Pinpointing these genetic mutations and understanding the environmental conditions that favor changes in breeding system are of great interest to both evolutionary biologists and plant breeders. The plant genus Schiedea (carnation family, Caryophyllaceae) is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and is a model to better understand the evolution of breeding strategies in plants. Among the 32 species of Schiedea, some only breed with other individuals of the same species, others only self-fertilize, and others still are transitional between the two. Additionally, different outbreeding species of Schiedea use different pollinators, including a recently discovered moth found only in Hawaii. This project will apply cutting-edge DNA sequencing and analysis methods to reconstruct the genealogy of Scheidea and investigate the evolution of plant breeding strategies within the group. Data from this project will provide new insights into the evolution of plant breeding strategies that could be applied to crop species in the carnation family, including amaranth, rhubarb, quinoa and spinach. The project incorporates extensive opportunities for education and training at multiple levels, including high school teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher. The project will produce educational videos about Hawaiian plants for posting on the internet to inform the public. Researchers will also offer public seminars about Schiedea highlighting their research findings about the group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to reconstruct the pattern of breeding system evolution in Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae) through an integrated program of field, laboratory, and genomic studies. Nuclear genome sequencing, targeted sequence capture, and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) methods will be used to reconstruct a highly resolved phylogenetic tree of Schiedea, identify sources of phylogenetic conflict, and investigate patterns of introgression among taxa. The phylogenetic hypotheses developed will be used to interpret the evolution of breeding systems including transitions from hermaphroditism to dioecy, shifts from biotic to abiotic pollination, and traits associated with pollination biology (including scent and nectar production). Field studies and densely distributed Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers generated by GBS will be used to test hypotheses concerning the influence of reproductive systems on gene flow, hybridization, and population genetic structure. Data obtained during this project will be applied directly to land management in Hawaii, including the establishment of wild populations of different Schiedea species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On one hand, aquaculture promises to fill the gap left by declining wild fisheries and to provide the world with a reliable, affordable form of fish. On the other hand, aquaculture can have negative consequences such as pollution, inequitable distribution of benefits, and ecological impacts on the wild fish harvested to produce fish feed. These tradeoffs are becoming increasingly evident around Lake Victoria. In the face of stagnating wild fisheries in Lake Victoria and a surging human population around its shores, aquaculture may improve food and livelihood security in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. An international team of researchers from three U.S., one Canadian, and three African institutions are investigating the potential for Lake Victoria-based aquaculture and the implications for wild fisheries, global and local supplies of fish, and regional economic development. Researchers will investigate how global demand for fish affects local markets and the fishers who supply them, how the distribution of benefits from aquaculture can be made more equitable, and how building aquaculture facilities in and near lakes affects the ecology and economics of wild fisheries. This work fills a critical gap in knowledge about the links between aquaculture and wild fish, and it will increase understanding of how emerging markets in developing countries can be structured to promote sustainability and equitability. Given links between poverty and political violence, improving food and income security in East Africa will promote development in a part of the globe with strategic importance to the United States. This project will also build technical and analytical capacity at three East African research institutes, train students in socio-ecological systems modeling, and engage a diverse international, interdisciplinary research team.<br/><br/>This project investigates the dynamic links between the ecology of Lake Victoria (a natural system), the economy of its surrounding fisheries (a human system), and the bridge between these systems created by aquaculture. Within the natural subsystem, dynamics of fish abundance are regulated by predation, competition, and lake productivity. Within the human subsystem, dynamics of demand for fish are driven by local fish consumption and global fish exports. The natural subsystem supplies fish catch to the human subsystem, and the human subsystem impacts fisheries through fishing effort. Aquaculture links these systems through additional production of fish and response to demand. This research will investigate the effects of aquaculture on wild fisheries and food commodity markets through an ecosystem accounting model (MIMES) that links lake biological dynamics with human socio-economic dynamics. New environmental, biological and socio-economic data will be collected through trawl, acoustic, and questionnaire-based surveys. New and existing data will be synthesized with GIS. The expansion of a forecasting model (International Futures or IFs) will investigate effects of global demand dynamics on our system. Finally, MIMES will be used to assess scenarios of aquaculture growth and tradeoffs in fish population dynamics, food security, and income security in the Lake Victoria basin."

Phytoplankton determine the health of lake ecosystems, from harmful blooms reducing water quality to fish productivity. They adapt to the conditions they live in but are sensitive to changes in the environment, including nutrients, light, temperature, and grazers. If phytoplankton species have many types with different responses to the environment, then they are more likely to successfully adapt to novel conditions. To understand how phytoplankton may respond to future lake environments, such as warmer and more nutrient-rich conditions, we need to understand how diverse phytoplankton are and what drives that diversity. This project will characterize the diversity of phytoplankton responses, both within and across species, to key factors that determine phytoplankton growth. The researchers will also use mathematical models to develop a new theory of what drives the diversity within and among species and test it with the empirical data. The results will enable better predictions of how lakes will respond to changing environments. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in multiple scientific approaches such as lake sampling, laboratory experiments, genomic analyses and mathematical modeling. Project results will be incorporated into K-12 teaching, including data exercises for rural schools in Michigan and teacher workshops that provide Professional Development Credit in evolution at the Texas Memorial Museum.<br/> <br/>This project will advance our knowledge of intraspecific trait variation in ecologically important microbes, phytoplankton, and provide insights into how trait diversity is generated and maintained, both within and among species. It will use an integrated approach combining the development of a theoretical framework for predicting intraspecific trait variation at different scales and tests of this theory though experimental trait determination and measurements of genetic relatedness among numerous phytoplankton strains isolated from different lakes. The eco-evolutionary framework will embed quantitative genetics approaches in a spatial metacommunity setting. To test the specific predictions from this framework for how intraspecific trait distributions depend on selection regime and other factors, the researchers will determine the degree of intraspecific variation (mean and variance) in key functional traits for several species of phytoplankton from major taxonomic groups in Michigan lakes of contrasting resource levels and grazing pressure, creating a gradient of selection regimes. The traits include resource utilization traits (phosphorus, nitrogen and light), temperature response traits, and cell size, often considered a proxy for grazer resistance. Looking at several traits simultaneously, the project will be able to explore pairwise and higher dimensional trade-offs within species, which has not previously been done for phytoplankton, and compare them to interspecific trade-offs.

These ants use plant leaf cuttings in order to cultivate a single, recently evolved fungal species, which they then eat.  However, a more poorly known group of fungus-farming ants in the genus Apterostigma, cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants combined. Closely related species of Apterostigma cultivate closely related groups of fungi, but major shifts to distantly related fungal groups have occurred multiple times during 40 million years of co-evolution between Apterostigma ants and fungus. This research aims to better understand the co-evolution of leaf-cutting ants and the fungi they cultivate. This includes developing new knowledge about the numbers, diversity and distribution of Apterostigma ant species and their associated fungi, as well as determining the evolutionary relationships among both ants and fungi. Questions to be addressed include: Why do leaf-cutting ants in the genus Apterostigma cultivate a greater diversity of fungal species than all other fungus-farming ants (leaf-cutting and non-leaf-cutting) combined? Why do some Apterostigma ant species cultivate only a few fungi that are closely related to each other, while others cultivate diverse fungi that are only distant relatives? The results from this research may benefit society in general because fungus-farming ants provide a rare non-human model system for the emerging fields of Darwinian agriculture and Darwinian medicine, which aim to improve human agriculture and disease management through the study of analogous natural systems. Recently several antibiotics and antimalarial quinones have been isolated and described from fungi and bacterial species living in association with leaf-cutting ants, making their biology particularly relevant to issues of health. Further, some fungi associated with leaf-cutting ants have become models for more efficient biofuel production.<br/><br/>This research will proceed by comprehensive field collecting of ants and fungi from nests throughout their distributions in nature, and documenting the presence or absence of co-speciation patterns in Apterostigma ants and their fungal cultivars, by comparing phylogenetic analyses based on genomic data for both ants and fungi.  The researchers will employ targeted enrichment of Ultra-Conserved genetic Elements (UCEs) to infer the species-level phylogenies. These phylogenies will be used in testing hypotheses of co-evolution and fungal species fidelity and mobility among host ant species over time. The genomic UCE data will also be used to resolve species boundaries (identify species) among poorly known species-complexes of Apterostigma ants. This is essential for reconstructing species-specific ant-fungus co-evolutionary interactions as well as for revising ant taxonomy and producing pictorial identification keys to various ant species."

One particularly vexing problem concerns the age of birds. Estimates based on the rate of DNA evolution suggest modern birds started to evolve about 160 million-years ago; the fossil record however, suggests an age that is scarcely older than 66 million years. Explaining the ~100-million-year gap in the fossil record profoundly limits our ability to understand when, how, and why modern bird diversity came to be. This project examines disagreements between molecular divergence time analyses and the avian fossil record, and studies a new hypothesis to explain the observed discrepancy. The project synthesizes data from paleontological and genomic datasets with predictions from population genetic theory. This work also paves the way for an integrative approach to studying evolutionary patterns across other branches of the tree of life. Moreover, the study investigates the effects of the K/Pg  (Cretaceous-Paleogene) mass extinction, with important implications for understanding the decimation of Mesozoic dinosaurs and their resurrection in the form of modern birds. Such work may reveal fundamental clues into how and when Earth's modern biodiversity arose. Finally, the researchers will take advantage of the diverse outreach mechanisms at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to communicate their findings to a broad audience.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project, the researchers will study the age of modern birds using a variety of simulation, empirical and theoretical approaches grounded in the study of systematics. The researchers will use recent developments in Bayesian modeling to test the hypothesis that transient miniaturization of body size in the wake of the K/Pg mass extinction can explain a period of molecular rate acceleration in the extinction's aftermath. In the second part of the project, the researchers will study the feasibility of reconstructing unknown life history traits from extant and extinct taxa, conditioned on inferred rates of molecular evolution. A key component of the work will be to advance expertise in distributed high performance computing for phylogenetics, and in analyzing data related to avian life history evolution. In general, the research will leverage the recognition that rates of genome evolution are an important axis of life history variation to promote a progressive approach to studying paleo-life history diversity, and enable the integration of historically disparate information sources. The research will have potentially broad significance to comparative biology and phylogenetics, and may influence the field of divergence time analysis in both the short and long term."

Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and University of Nebraska at Kearney will be trained in a broad range of morphological and molecular systematic skills, and University of Wisconsin, Madison undergraduate students will gain tropical field biology experience through a planned capstone field course.  Information about Salvia will be disseminated through a project website geared towards professional botanists and sage enthusiasts, while other project data will be presented more broadly through publically-accessible databases. <br/><br/>The ability to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships using genome-wide DNA sequence data and powerful computational resources has revolutionized the field of systematics.  These new phylogenies now provide a framework to investigate the different processes that facilitate the diversification of species within a lineage. Salvia (Lamiaceae) has a worldwide distribution and diversified extensively, both in terms of the number of species, and the variety of floral and vegetative morphologies present within the group.  This research will investigate the evolution of the unique staminal feature present in members of the genus, and test whether the origin of this character is correlated with an increase in rates of speciation. Researchers will sample about 650 of the 1000 described Salvia species and use Next Generation Sequencing approaches to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Salvia and close relatives using over 450 nuclear genes and the chloroplast genome. This phylogenetic framework will then be used to determine the timing and biogeographic location of increased rates of speciation within the group. Morphometric analyses of key floral features will then be evaluated within the context of the Salvia phylogeny to test the hypothesis that the evolution of floral features have served as key innovations within the group."

A premier example is the toxic chemicals in the skin of poison frogs. Because these frogs are brightly colored, predators such as birds and snakes learn to avoid them. These toxins are alkaloids, found in many animals and plants. The frogs acquire these chemical defenses by eating ants and other arthropods that contain the alkaloids. These frog alkaloids (e.g., tetrodotoxin, batrachotoxin) are pharmacologically important and cause muscle paralysis, and disrupt breathing and cardiac function. At the cellular level, alkaloids affect ion channels, which control the transmission of nerve impulses. Surprisingly, the ion channels of poison frogs are are not affected by their own toxins; thus, deciphering how this evolved has important broader impacts that translate to human health. This research will use evolutionary trees to guide the activities: fieldwork to acquire and characterize natural alkaloids and collect ecological data on the species, molecular evolution of ion channel resistance to alkaloids, and neurophysiological effects of alkaloids on ion channels. The research will provide opportunities for students from the University of Texas and Indiana State University to jointly participate in international fieldwork, acquire new skills in bioinformatics, molecular modeling, genomics, and neurophysiology, as well as promote interactions between the two universities.<br/><br/>The project will use Next-Generation DNA sequencing of transcriptomes, targeted sequencing of hundreds of genes, and bioinformatics methods to reconstruct evolutionary trees that will guide the research program with an experimental framework for explaining the origin of resistance, which has evolved multiple times in the poison frogs (family Dendrobatidae). Sequencing will also be used to identify novel amino acid replacements that may confer resistance to alkaloids. Computational modeling and in vitro assays of mutated ion channels will determine if these novel replacements provide resistance to natural and synthesized alkaloids. Fieldwork will focus on acquiring genetic samples, skin alkaloids, and color photographs from multiple populations of frogs, using natural history collection standards data collection and voucher specimens preparation. The combination of approaches will provide novel insights in the systematics of Dendrobatidae poison frogs, and also the evolution of auto-resistance to toxic alkaloids within the group."

Members of the lobelia plant family (Lobeliaceae) restricted to the Hawaiian Islands have undergone a remarkable divergence in habitat, growth form, leaf size and shape, floral morphology, and mechanism of seed dispersal, and are considered one of the best examples of an adaptive radiation in plants. Previous studies have shown that this group of 140 species was derived from a single colonization 13 million years ago, long before many of the Hawaiian islands of today had emerged from the Pacific. Hawaiian lobeliads now represent 12% of the native Hawaiian flora and are the most species-rich plant lineage found on any single group of oceanic islands on Earth. The two largest genera, Cyanea and Clermontia, comprising approximately 100 species form the largest sublineage within the group. Previous phylogenetic analyses of Cyanea-Clermontia were inconclusive due to a combination of limited sampling within the group and insufficient DNA sequence variation to reconstruct a well-supported estimate of relationships. Cyanea-Clermontia, by its very size, ecological and morphological diversity, and high proportion of species restricted to single islands (each of known age), offers unique opportunities for studying adaptive radiation, speciation, and historical biogeography. Understanding relationships within this lineage could provide new insights into the rise of plant and animal diversity on Hawaii, and identify traits associated with a tendency to become rare or extinct. This project will (1) broadly train a graduate student in plant systematics and historical biogeography analyses; (2) develop molecular phylogenetic analysis pipelines to aid in the study of other recent radiations; (3) produce a well-documented collection of DNA samples to permit future studies of this important group; and (4) create a website on the diversification of native Hawaiian lobeliads, to disseminate findings to a broad range of amateur botanists and lobeliad enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Next-generation DNA sequencing data will be used to infer phylogenies of Cyanea-Clermontia from whole-chloroplast genomes and >400 nuclear genes for all living species sampled across their range. Analyses of these data will permit derivation of species trees and networks, analysis of hybridization, introgression, and other forms of reticulate evolution (important in Clermontia), reconstruct its geographic spread through time, and infer the pattern and tempo of evolution of key morphological and ecological character-states using a variety of tree- and network-based approaches."

This project investigates the evolution of vision within beetles, the most diverse groups of life on the planet. Many beetles are known to be significant agricultural pests and understanding how these organisms perceive their surroundings and find mates may provide new methods for controlling their spread.  Jewel beetles (family name Buprestidae), otherwise known as the metallic wood-boring beetles, are a large group of charismatic insects that have captured the eye of artists, jewelry makers, and scientists alike due to their broad diversity of iridescent coloration. Jewel beetles also possess members of significant economic importance, most notably the Emerald Ash Borer - an introduced pest species that is rapidly destroying large numbers of ash trees in the U.S.   Little is known about the genealogy of jewel beetles, how color vision is achieved within the group, or how the brilliant shell colors are formed. This project will reconstruct genealogical relationships within the group using DNA sequence data and then use a novel combination of experiments to better understand the physiological functions of their visual proteins (opsins).  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in diverse field and laboratory approaches, including molecular, phylogenetic, and physiological methods.  A learning module based on results from the research will also be developed for high school AP Biology courses in line with state education standards.<br/><br/>Jewel beetles are some of the most well-known insects, but phylogenetic relationships within the group are poorly understood. This research project will use transcriptomic data to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships to provide the evolutionary framework necessary to investigate the molecular components of color vision (e.g., opsin proteins).  The sensitivity of these visual proteins will then be tested through expression in a model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, and morphological analyses will be used to explore how colors and patterns on the exoskeleton are formed. Using this novel combination of visual pigment protein transcriptomics, ectopic visual pigment expression in HEK cells and Drosophila melanogaster, and analysis of cuticular color, this integrative project will provide new insights into the evolution of vision in a poorly known, yet agriculturally important, group of beetles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The group includes killifishes, guppies, and swordtails, and is well known among aquarium hobbyists, toxicologists, and as a model organism in cancer research. Goodeids are an imperiled group of freshwater fishes that occur in Mexico and the Southwestern United States and consist of two main lines of diversification; a depauperate group of egg laying species, and a speciose group that bear live offspring. Many groups in the order, including the viviparous (live birthing) species, are understudied from an ecological and evolutionary perspective.The evolutionary relationships of groups within the order are unclear and the relationships of the species and genera within the Goodeidae family have not been adequately studied. The lack of a robust family tree has impeded both basic and applied research on the splitfins. Resolving the evolutionary relationships within the Cyprinodontiformes, as well as within the Goodeidae species, will advance our understanding of life-history evolution, morphological diversification, taxonomy, and conservation.  The researchers will write a handbook for aquarists and conservation biologists containing recommendations for maintenance and breeding guidelines for maintaining genetic and phenotypic diversity of goodeids in captivity. The researchers will work with the Goodeid Working Group to update the Goodeidae conservation status and trends information as well as contribute to aquarist-oriented publications and conventions to promote appropriate captive Goodeidae rearing.  These efforts will enhance conservation efforts of these fishes which are critical to resource managers especially considering the ongoing environmental changes in the areas occupied by the Goodeidae.<br/><br/><br/>This integrative project will involve multiple graduate and undergraduate students, international and United States collaborators, and citizen scientists.  Specimens will be collected in the United States and Latin America and the vouchered tissue samples, which are important for future studies, will be deposited in research collections in the United States and Mexico. Citizen scientists will provide pedigreed larval specimens of all species of Goodeidae. These are historically difficult to obtain and will be used for scanning electron microscopic examination of trophotaeniae, a poorly understudied larval taxonomic character that is critical to the unusual live births in this group. This study will result in the construction of phylogenetic trees for the Cyprinodontiformes and the Goodeidae based on traditional (10 loci, and >7,000bp sequence data) and next generation sequencing approaches (anchored phylogenomics), offering the most comprehensive tests of previous phylogenetic hypotheses for these groups.  The incorporation of geometric morphometric and trophotaenial data, fossil calibrations, and phylogenetic comparative methods will allow for a better understanding of the timing of diversification and the factors that have played a role in radiation of this interesting group of fishes.

Phylogenies have extended the branches of their influence from the scientific to the public realm, informing decisions regarding the surveillance and monitoring of pathogens, vaccine design, and conservation priorities. Although many phylogenies are based on molecular sequence data (DNA) collected from extant species (or strains), these trees can also provide information regarding the absolute or relative branching times within a lineage.  This temporal information is critical to many questions, such as inferring when a virulent strain of a virus first arose and estimating how quickly it is changing.  These considerations have motivated the development of a large number of mathematical models for inferring the time scale of evolutionary trees. This project seeks to assess the reliability of these mathematical models using empirical datasets, and will inform researchers and public alike on the best practices for using these methods. Undergraduates recruited through the University of California Historically Black Colleges and Universities initiative and the US Davis Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity will be trained in statistical phylogenetic methods and bioinformatics.  All software developed will be distributed freely under open-source licenses.  The researcher will also develop a new, stand-alone workshop and associated teaching materials on Bayesian divergence-time estimation methods to be used broadly, including by researchers who do not work directly in phylogenetic research.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this research is to explore the statistical behavior of Bayesian methods for estimating species divergence times in an empirical setting. This main goal will be achieved by applying all currently implemented relaxed-clock models and calibration methods to a large sample of empirical datasets to: (1) reveal the extent to which divergence-time estimates are sensitive to the specified relaxed-clock model/calibration method; (2) explore the relative influence of the three primary model components - branch-rate priors, node-age priors, and calibration approaches - on divergence-time estimates; (3) assess the relative fit of the pool of candidate relaxed-clock models to real data using robust Bayesian model-comparison methods; and (4) develop analytical protocols and implement pipelines that automate the efficient exploration of relaxed-clock model space for empirical analyses. Facilitating more careful model selection will improve our ability to estimate divergence times, which, in turn, will broadly benefit scientific and broader communities."

Ray-finned fishes, representing half of all vertebrate diversity with 30,000 species, have an astonishingly disparate array of body forms. Fishes are also intensively harvested for human consumption, potentially leading to major impacts on their diversity and their ability to serve both as ecological role players and as a human food source. This project will aim to test the evolvability hypothesis by collecting data on fish body shape using museum collections and crowdsourcing. The researchers will digitize a vast store of biodiversity in museum collections to be made available online, for use by the public and interested researchers.<br/><br/>This project will (1) build the largest phylogeny of vertebrates, with over 12,000 species represented, (2) digitize ichthyology collections at three museums, (3) collect the largest geometric morphometric dataset, consisting of shape data for over 9,000 species of fishes, and (4) reconstruct the disparity among different fish lineages, and how their rates of body shape evolution have changed over time. Several key macroevolutionary predictions can be made based on differential evolvability across clades. More evolvable lineages should have higher richness and diversification rates, and enjoy more phenotypic disparity and rates of phenotypic evolution. Additionally, lineages that enjoy fast phenotypic evolution should also diversify into a larger variety of ecological niches."

Phytoplankton determine the health of lake ecosystems, from harmful blooms reducing water quality to fish productivity. They adapt to the conditions they live in but are sensitive to changes in the environment, including nutrients, light, temperature, and grazers. If phytoplankton species have many types with different responses to the environment, then they are more likely to successfully adapt to novel conditions. To understand how phytoplankton may respond to future lake environments, such as warmer and more nutrient-rich conditions, we need to understand how diverse phytoplankton are and what drives that diversity. This project will characterize the diversity of phytoplankton responses, both within and across species, to key factors that determine phytoplankton growth. The researchers will also use mathematical models to develop a new theory of what drives the diversity within and among species and test it with the empirical data. The results will enable better predictions of how lakes will respond to changing environments. Graduate students and postdoctoral associates will be trained in multiple scientific approaches such as lake sampling, laboratory experiments, genomic analyses and mathematical modeling.

It will use an integrated approach combining the development of a theoretical framework for predicting intraspecific trait variation at different scales and tests of this theory though experimental trait determination and measurements of genetic relatedness among numerous phytoplankton strains isolated from different lakes. The eco-evolutionary framework will embed quantitative genetics approaches in a spatial metacommunity setting. To test the specific predictions from this framework for how intraspecific trait distributions depend on selection regime and other factors, the researchers will determine the degree of intraspecific variation (mean and variance) in key functional traits for several species of phytoplankton from major taxonomic groups in Michigan lakes of contrasting resource levels and grazing pressure, creating a gradient of selection regimes. The traits include resource utilization traits (phosphorus, nitrogen and light), temperature response traits, and cell size, often considered a proxy for grazer resistance. Looking at several traits simultaneously, the project will be able to explore pairwise and higher dimensional trade-offs within species, which has not previously been done for phytoplankton, and compare them to interspecific trade-offs. Additionally, the eco-evolutionary models developed to predict intraspecific variation in multidimensional trait space at different spatial scales should be relevant for other organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To explain this unexpectedly high species diversity, this research team will investigate how environmental changes associated with the formation of the Andes Mountains influenced the distribution, diversification and evolution of tropical tree species in the region. Understanding the relationships between mountain uplift, environmental change, and species distributions is not only important to identify the causes of the remarkable Andean diversity, but also provides insight into how species respond to large-scale changes in environmental conditions. This information, in turn, can guide regional conservation and management aimed at conserving diverse and resilient biological communities. This project is unique because it is conducted over vast areas and deep evolutionary time scales. Because of the broad scope, project results are likely to significantly advance understanding of the long-term consequences of the emergence of novel environments for the formation and organization of biologically diverse communities. <br/><br/>This project will test the the importance of elevational gradients for shaping community composition by integrating datasets on plant species distributions, functional traits and evolutionary relationships. Following mountain uplift, new environments at different elevations are hypothesized to promote (1) rapid adaptive diversification of clades, (2) immigration and ecological sorting of pre-adapted clades, or (3) a combination of both processes. This study will simultaneously explore these mechanisms and disentangle their relative contributions to the assembly of a hyper-diverse regional flora. This project leverages data from the Madidi Project that has already documented the elevational distribution of tree species in the Bolivian Andes. Distributional and elevation data will be integrated with a comprehensive database of plant-specimens for across the New World and elevational surveys of 10 plant functional traits. A large phylogeny of all seed plants will be developed and used to study turnover in species and functions among plant communities at different elevations and among biogeographic regions across the Neotropics.

One of the most spectacular types of migration, which occurs in fish such as salmon, eels, shad and sturgeon, involves movement between rivers and oceans to feed and reproduce. Many of these migratory fishes are important to their ecosystem and for recreational and commercial harvests. However, the evolution of migration and its consequences for species traits remains mysterious. The group of fishes that includes herrings, sardines, shads, and anchovies (Clupeiformes), is an excellent model for studying migration because it includes a large number of migratory species, many of which are of economic importance. Surprisingly, the evolutionary relationships and taxonomy of these fishes is poorly understood. The goal of this project is to use DNA sequence and anatomical data to generate a tree of life for Clupeiformes, and use this group as a model to understand the evolution of migration. The project will determine which traits are associated with migration, and how these traits evolve differently in migratory fishes compared to non-migratory fishes. The broader impacts of this project include training for a postdoc, two graduate students, high school teachers and first-generation undergraduates from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines, including current and former military members and community college transfer students. In addition, this project will revise the taxonomy of Clupeiformes, including discovery and description of new species, provide taxonomic keys for their identification, and develop an open, online database of all migratory fishes. <br/><br/>This project will generate a comprehensive phylogeny of Clupeiformes using genome-scale data and morphological characters to investigate the evolution of diadromy and its impact on lineage and phenotypic diversity. Using targeted exon capture, the project will sequence >1000 loci for phylogenetics and investigating the molecular evolution of diadromy. Morphological characters will be identified in understudied systems such as the gill arches, brain case, and soft tissue using dry skeletons, whole specimens, digital CT-scanned images and clear and stained specimens. The molecular basis for adaptation to a diadromous life history will be determined by testing for differences in rates and patterns of selection in osmoregulatory and vision genes. State-dependent diversification and sister comparison analyses will be used to test whether diadromy drives differences in rates of lineage diversification. Rates of morphological evolution will be estimated using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods that incorporate missing taxa and uncertainty in parameter estimates and phylogeny. Using functional traits related to locomotion and feeding, the project also will determine whether migratory fishes reside on distinct macroevolutionary adaptive peaks associated with locomotion and feeding. Comparative methods will be used to determine the best-fit models of evolution for various traits associated with diadromy, and test to whether these traits are under strong selection. This project will reveal the macroevolutionary dynamics of diadromy across multiple biological scales and resolve the systematics and taxonomy of Clupeiformes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What is the fate of plant populations in this increasingly altered world? Interactions between plants and their pollinators are being disrupted in human-disturbed habitats, leading to increased rates of self-fertilization (seeds produced with pollen from the same flower vs. from another plant) by plants. Because offspring produced by self-fertilization are more likely to have decreased survival and reproduction, a major conservation concern relates to whether and how loss of pollinator services for individual plants scales up to influence plant population growth and persistence. This research will experimentally evaluate the impact of changes in the frequency of self-fertilization on population growth under different ecological conditions. The focal species is affected by habitat fragmentation and is classified as imperiled in several states. Findings will contribute broadly to our understanding of and ability to predict the fates of these and other similar plant and animal species in a changing world. Additionally, the researcher will implement outreach programs, leading educational programs in plant-pollinator interactions at yearly K-6 summer camps. Yearly survey data of wild populations will be collected by citizen scientists. A postdoctoral associate, graduate student, and numerous undergraduates will be trained in research and outreach skills. <br/><br/><br/>This project employs a powerful experimental demographic approach to evaluate the impact of mating system (pattern of inbreeding) on population growth of a self-compatible plant, Sabatia angularis (rosepin), across competitive contexts. Selfing rate (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and competitive context (high vs. low interspecific competition) of experimental populations will be directly manipulated through hand pollinations and contrasting mowing regimes. The demographic fates of all individuals will be followed over three generations. Demographic data will be used to parameterize models from which population dynamics can be derived. The impact of selfing rate, competitive context, and their interaction on vital rates (growth, survival, fecundity) and population growth rate will be evaluated, including non-linear relationships. The underlying causes of observed changes (or similarities) in growth rate across experimental treatments will be investigated with additional demographic analyses. Demographic models will also be constructed to mimic the experimental mating-system gradient by incorporating prior static inbreeding depression estimates in silico and outcomes compared to experimental results. Research findings will further address the ecological impacts of genetic load, demographic costs of selection, and impacts of intraspecific variation on species coexistence."

This is not due to lack of carbon dioxide, whose concentration in the atmosphere has been on the increase.  Rather, it is due to the growth-limiting effects caused by the lack of other available nutrients in soil,  especially nitrogen and phosphorous.  Nevertheless, computer ecosystem models used to estimate the response of plants to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide predict that this environmental change will result in more rapid and abundant plant growth globally. Such models fail to incorporate the effects of other limiting nutrients on plant growth. This project will bring together experimental scientists and computer modelers to explore the effects of nutrients on plant growth, determine whether nutrient supplies are adequate to promote the growth predicted by models, and decide how to best represent the effects of nutrients in global computer models. Research coordination via this network is important for establishing how the carbon cycle is likely to change in response to global environmental change, with important implications for soil fertility and agriculture.  The project will train multiple early career scientists, foster a number of diverse international collaborations, and engage with broad audiences using multiple scientific and social media platforms.<br/><br/>The proposed Research Coordination Network (INCyTE) will bring together two communities that historically have not interacted closely: biogeochemical experimentalists and earth system modelers. The overarching goals of INCyTE are to enhance our understanding of nutrient cycling feedbacks on the global carbon (C) cycle in general, and to integrate different investigators, data, and experimental and conceptual frameworks to improve representation of nutrient interactions and constraints on the global terrestrial C cycle in Earth System Models (ESMs). While nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and others) have the potential to mediate plant growth responses to elevated carbon dioxide (and interact with a host of other global changes), only a handful of current global simulation models even attempt to represent those interactions and feedbacks. This project will: 1) Identify gaps in understanding/representation of modeled C-nutrients feedbacks and processes; 2) Coordinate a number of small-scale, coummunity-based, high-throughput experiments to address particular hypotheses and identify candidate processes for further attention; 3) Use network syntheses and community-based experimental data to enhance model representation of nutrient cycling; and 4) Employ new ESM inter-comparisons.

This study will determine what makes fertilization possible among some individuals but not others. It combines two disciplines to understand how ecological processes (when are novel proteins more successful?) can drive evolution (when do new proteins proliferate in the genome?).  Insight will be gained into how populations might rapidly evolve reproductive traits to adapt to rapid changes in the abundance of species.  It will also provide data on how reproductive behavior can influence the association between interacting genes.

Understanding the evolution of reproductive compatibility may help in the management of small populations and captive breeding for species of conservation interest.<br/><br/>Theory predicts that gamete recognition might be relaxed when population density is low and gamete competition is relaxed. Fertilization experiments will examine how specific sperm and egg proteins interact to determine reproductive compatibility and how patterns of sperm availability influence selection on these proteins.  Sea urchins provide a model system for exploring these questions that would be impossible in species, such as mammals, with internal fertilization. The ability to age sea urchins, which can live for over 200 years, coupled with long-term data on human-driven changes in sea otter population density enables this unique historical study of evolution in action. This research will provide key insights into why some males and females have increased reproductive compatibility and why selection often favors the evolution of incompatible types."

Studies of local adaptation have historically focused on geographically separated populations, where adaptive differences are maintained by limited dispersal of individuals between populations. Growing evidence, however, suggests that adaptive evolution can occur over small spatial distances. How this fine scale, adaptation arises and is maintained remains unresolved, despite applications for human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. On Santa Cruz Island, the Island Scrub Jay has two morphologies. Birds in pine habitat have long and thin beaks where as those in oak habitats have short and deep beaks. These differences are known to facilitate feeding on pine cones versus acorns, but how such adaptive genetic differences are maintained over very small geographic distances is unknown. The researchers will collect data on the genomes of individuals from both types of habitats to test if the same set of genes are differentiated between pine and oak populations, and how other regions of the genome change spatially across the island. These measurements will be coupled with telemetry studies that track how birds move and use oak and pine habitats. In addition, vocal experiments will test if males prefer females that originate within their habitat. The data obtained from this work will then be used to develop general models that can inform the conditions under with adaptive differences in can occur. Such models would be of interest to conservation managers that manage this and other unique or rare species. Additionally, the project will produce a learning module for high school classroom use, and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cases of microgeographic adaptation challenge classical evolutionary theory that posits adaptive divergence should be constrained by gene flow, leading to a reassessment of the spatial scale at which evolutionary processes occur. The research team has recently discovered replicated, adaptive divergence in jay bill shape in adjacent oak and pine habitats, despite gene flow between these adjacent habitats. This pattern occurs across habitats separated by less than one kilometer. The researchers will test alternative hypotheses about how divergent selection, dispersal, and non-random mating shape adaptive divergence in bill morphology. In Aim 1, they develop population genetic models that test the interacting effects of selection, gene flow, assortative mating, and genetic architecture at different spatial scales. In Aim 2, they will test for divergent selection by measuring selection gradients, examining patterns of genomic divergence, and by identifying candidate genes associated with variation in bill morphology. In Aim 3, they will use a combination of population genomics, telemetry, and transplant experiments to test for population genomic structure and if dispersal is non-random In Aim 4, they will test if divergence in bill morphology is correlated with vocalizations and facilitates assortative mating. Collectively, the proposed work takes an integrative approach in a tractable study system. This research has broad implications for understanding both the spatial scale at which adaptive divergence occurs, and the conditions that allow individuals within a single population to diverge across heterogeneous habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lodgepole pine forests of Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming) are well adapted to large, severe wildfires, which have burned at 100 to 300-yr intervals during the past 10,000 years. However, the interval between fires is shortening, making it likely that young forests will re-burn before fully recovering from previous fires. How forests will respond to more frequent fire and warmer, drier conditions is not known. Wildfires during summer 2016 burned young forests (less than 30 years old) that grew after the momentous 1988 Yellowstone Fires. These recent fires produced an unexpected opportunity to study the characteristics of short-interval fires and their effects on western pine forests. Sampling soon after severe fire is necessary because the time to find field evidence of burn severity is very short after the fire, and most tree seedlings establish during the first year after the fire. This RAPID award will measure burn severity, tree establishment and carbon storage in young forests that burned in 2016. Results will be immediately useful to regional forest managers, and mini-documentary videos will explain effects of increasing fire activity on western forests to a wide audience. Field data also will be used to improve computer models of forest growth and to assess burn-severity patterns across the US northern Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Field studies in areas burned in the 1988 fires that burned again in 2106 will test three hypotheses. (1) Short-interval fires will reduce forest resilience because burns will be of high severity, and post-fire conifer regeneration and carbon storage will be substantially reduced. (2) Post-fire climate will amplify consequences of short fire-return intervals such that post-fire conifer establishment will be substantially reduced (or fail) in re-burns where conditions are warm and dry. (3) Regionally, the proportion of high-severity fire will be greater in short-interval than long-interval fires, but landscape patterns of high-severity fire will be similar. Burn severity, tree regeneration and carbon storage will be measured during summer 2017 in 0.25-ha plots following standard protocols. A seed addition experiment will be conducted to separate effects of seed supply from post-fire climate conditions on tree seedling establishment. Plot-based burn-severity data will be used to validate satellite-based burn-severity metrics and to map spatial patterns of burn severity in short-interval fires across the Northern Rockies. This study will help scientists and managers understand conditions likely to change forest ecosystems fundamentally in a future with more fire."

This project studies the timing and success of reproduction in tropical forest plants. Tropical species may use cues of seasonal shifts (for example, in rainfall or light availability) to time the start of reproduction, perhaps to ensure their seeds are dispersed during conditions that will be favorable for the growth and survival of young seedlings. Rainfall, light availability, temperature, and other environmental conditions influence each stage of reproduction- flowering, fruit maturation, seed dispersal, and seedling growth. Beneficial conditions for reproduction can vary within a year, due to seasonality, and among years, due to climate cycles like El Nino. This project focuses on long term data in order to capture periods when conditions are better or worse for various types of plants. The research takes place at multiple tropical forest study sites to separate the effects of local weather variability from large regional climate patterns. By measuring the cues tropical plants use to start reproduction and examining which environmental conditions affect seedling growth and survival, the long-term data from this project will strengthen our ability to predict the future of tropical forests and the benefits these forests confer to society. Training of multiple undergraduate students will occur at the sites, by each of the collaborating universities.<br/><br/>These long-term studies will enable tests of hypotheses concerning: (1) what are the environmental cues that induce flowering; (2) how is reproduction in tropical forests affected by disturbances such as wind storms, droughts, and by natural climate cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which vary at subdecadal to multidecadal time scales;  (3) how do species with different traits (e.g., small vs. large seeds, soft vs. dense wood) respond to environmental variation; and (4) how does episodic reproduction ramify through to the structure of adult populations. This research approach will effectively close the demographic gap between studies of early reproduction and the dynamics of sapling and adult tree populations. At each of the field sites, species-specific flower, fruit and seed rain is recorded multiple times each year using seed traps. Additionally, all woody seedlings are recorded in an annual census of hundreds of 1-m2 plots adjacent to seed traps, at each site.

The data will be used to address several questions about mid-stage forest recovery and how the pattern of recovery can change over time including: the effect of restoration interventions on within- and across-site biodiversity; the degree to which manipulations of initial conditions result in convergent or divergent successional trajectories from reference forest; and the relative importance of local- versus landscape-scale processes on forest recovery."

In order to understand how cities can support both humans and biodiversity, greater collaboration is needed among scientists, urban planners, and design professionals. This project will create a research coordination network to bring together these disciplines to study the factors affecting biodiversity in cities (UrBioNet). The network will facilitate engagement of scientists globally and develop databases and materials focusing on the plants and animals of cities that are relevant to local residents, urban planners, and managers. This project will expand existing global databases of plants and birds in cities and develop new databases of bats, fish, and insect pollinators of cities and their surrounding regions. The network will focus on the compilation and monitoring of urban biota in areas of high regional biodiversity, such as tropical cities and cities within biodiversity hotspots. Three scientific working groups will use information collected in this network to answer questions regarding the ecological relationships of different species to urbanization, with consideration of cultural and social aspects, and develop recommendations for monitoring urban ecosystems. Key activities in support of the network include: network-wide meetings; workshops; and the development of an online graduate course on urban biodiversity. UrBioNet will further serve the scientific community by supporting the development of global, regional, and local databases to test hypotheses on the patterns of species based on the physical, climatic, and social features of cities. <br/><br/>Outcomes from this project will enhance our understanding of the ecology of cities and provide useful information to planners and managers for the monitoring and preservation of biodiversity in urban regions. By targeting activities in regions with less data availability, UrBioNet will enhance knowledge transfer among regions with different degrees of investment in urban ecological research and monitoring. The network will develop monitoring protocols that will standardize data collection methods and be economically feasible to implement. Planners, managers, and practitioners will be active participants in the network.  Online courses will be developed for graduate students at 13 universities (including two historically black universities) in the U.S., and UrBioNet will involve undergraduate students through campus-based biodiversity monitoring projects led by network participants at up to 21 universities in the U.S., Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America."

Results from this research will inform contemporary debates about the potential for climate change to create 'no analog' communities that differ fundamentally in their structure, function, and the services they provide to society.  They will also guide management practices intended to restore communities to prior states and improve our understanding of the consequences of widespread extinctions.<br/><br/>This project builds on prior evidence that plant communities changed dramatically during the last deglaciation because the extinction of large grazers released plants from herbivore suppression.

The investigators will collect and analyze a series of lake-sediment cores in the eastern US, and quantify relationships among independent climatic and ecological proxies within and across sites in order to test the Megafaunal Release Hypothesis. Eight new lake sites will be analyzed for indicators of past vegetation composition (fossil pollen), fire regime (sedimentary charcoal), megafaunal abundance (spores from fungi found in dung), and temperature (organic geochemistry). Broader impacts include the mentoring and training of a postdoctoral research scientist, a graduate student, and several undergraduates, and the expansion of collaborations among paleontologists, geographers, and ecologists to understand future environmental change.

More recently, government regulations have reduced the levels of acid rain and created an opportunity to assess the ability of these forests to recover from past damage. Assessing the impact of changes in acid deposition requires long-term measurements and experiments in order to detect trends and better understand how forests function under changing conditions.  Such long-term records and experiments are extremely rare.  This project focuses on a unique, long-term dataset and manipulative experiments at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia.  The research will continue long-term measurements, some of which have been made continuously at FEF since 1951. It will also continue two complementary experimental manipulations: a whole-watershed acidification experiment that began in 1989, and a Long Term Soil Productivity experiment that began in 1996.  The unique data resulting from these experiments will significantly improve our understanding of the link between changes in air pollution and forest health in ways that inform public policy, enhance ecological theory, and improve forest management practices.<br/><br/>Data from this project will be used along with the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model and supplemental measurements to examine four questions about the impacts of acid and nitrogen deposition on forested watersheds: (1) Has a diminished biological demand for nitrate (a source of water pollution) contributed to enhanced nitrate losses?; (2) Are greater nitrate losses following nitrogen additions to a young forest due to something other than increased rates of nitrate production?; (3) Will chronic nitrogen addition and acidification diminish carbon storage in young forests?; and (4) Does enhanced nitrogen availability reduce the diversity of forest herbs and trees?  In addition, a significant amount of damage caused by Superstorm Sandy at the FEF created a unique opportunity to examine whether greater nitrogen availability causes forests to be more susceptible to damage by severe storm events.  This project will continue an internship program that trained 20 students during the last 5 years and a creative writing course designed to inspire a new generation of non-fiction writers by challenging them to learn about (and reflect on) the long-term studies at the FEF.  The writing course trained 18 students in the last 3 years and is part of the National Ecological Reflections Network."

Previous attempts to determine how many species there are and how they are related have failed because of the large number of potential species involved, extensive hybridization among these species, and the seemingly recent evolutionary divergence of species within the group. The limited understanding of goldenrod biodiversity has slowed progress in plant evolutionary ecology.  Goldenrods have emerged as a critical study system for many important processes including species formation, invasive species biology, nutrient cycling in soils, and pollination biology. This research will reconstruct evolutionary relationships in the group by using large amounts of DNA sequence data. Project participants, including three undergraduate researchers, will sample tissue from specimens representing all 150 putative goldenrod species under the guidance of a project collaborator who is the global expert on goldenrod taxonomy. This approach will allow the genealogy of this large genus to be reconstructed rapidly and economically, and will provide an essential evolutionary framework for other goldenrod researchers.<br/><br/>This project will employ an anchored phylogenomics approach to capture DNA sequence data from 1200 locations across the genome of goldenrods (Solidago, Asteraceae). Multiple samples from each species will be obtained exclusively from herbarium specimens, which have been shown to harbor DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for this genomic technique. Sampling will focus on the >4200 Solidago herbarium specimens for which the research team and collaborators have previously obtained a chromosome count, with the cytotype of additional samples estimated using a highly-accurate microsatellite allele number approach. Both diploids-only and combined diploid/polyploid species trees will be reconstructed in order to establish both divergent and reticulate evolutionary events. Phylogenetic, taxonomic, and methodological results stemming from this research will be disseminated in scientific journals and more broadly through a Solidago-focused website maintained by a project collaborator."

Lodgepole pine forests of Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming) are well adapted to large, severe wildfires, which have burned at 100 to 300-yr intervals during the past 10,000 years. However, the interval between fires is shortening, making it likely that young forests will re-burn before fully recovering from previous fires. How forests will respond to more frequent fire and warmer, drier conditions is not known. Wildfires during summer 2016 burned young forests (less than 30 years old) that grew after the momentous 1988 Yellowstone Fires. These recent fires produced an unexpected opportunity to study the characteristics of short-interval fires and their effects on western pine forests. Sampling soon after severe fire is necessary because the time to find field evidence of burn severity is very short after the fire, and most tree seedlings establish during the first year after the fire. This RAPID award will measure burn severity, tree establishment and carbon storage in young forests that burned in 2016. Results will be immediately useful to regional forest managers, and mini-documentary videos will explain effects of increasing fire activity on western forests to a wide audience. Field data also will be used to improve computer models of forest growth and to assess burn-severity patterns across the US northern Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>Field studies in areas burned in the 1988 fires that burned again in 2106 will test three hypotheses. (1) Short-interval fires will reduce forest resilience because burns will be of high severity, and post-fire conifer regeneration and carbon storage will be substantially reduced. (2) Post-fire climate will amplify consequences of short fire-return intervals such that post-fire conifer establishment will be substantially reduced (or fail) in re-burns where conditions are warm and dry. (3) Regionally, the proportion of high-severity fire will be greater in short-interval than long-interval fires, but landscape patterns of high-severity fire will be similar. Burn severity, tree regeneration and carbon storage will be measured during summer 2017 in 0.25-ha plots following standard protocols. A seed addition experiment will be conducted to separate effects of seed supply from post-fire climate conditions on tree seedling establishment. Plot-based burn-severity data will be used to validate satellite-based burn-severity metrics and to map spatial patterns of burn severity in short-interval fires across the Northern Rockies. This study will help scientists and managers understand conditions likely to change forest ecosystems fundamentally in a future with more fire."

This relationship, observed in dozens of species in scores of habitats, consistently shows that the number of surviving offspring produced per female declines as the number of individuals in the population increases. Managing the harvest of these species depends on understanding this relationship because the largest harvests are sustained when populations are neither too big nor too small. Despite the importance of density dependence to hunters, pastoralists, and ranchers worldwide, the mechanism producing this relationship remains poorly understood. The goal of this project is to improve our general understanding of the mechanism causing density dependence in herbivore populations. Achieving this goal could fundamentally change how wildlife, livestock, and rangelands are managed. Impacts of the work will be expanded by summarizing the effects of density dependence on harvest of wild and domestic herbivores in media accessible to managers and policy makers. Recommendations for best practices will be made based on the research.<br/><br/>A synthesis of thirty years of research on foraging behavior and population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores will support development of new, broadly explanatory mathematical and statistical models showing how nutritional characteristics of plant communities create density dependence. These models will predict how density dependence is altered by animal body mass, the biomass of plants, and the mean and variance of nutrient concentrations in plants, for example protein or metabolizable energy content. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of fitting these models to data using modern Bayesian methods. Evidence in data for competing models will be evaluated. A new, theoretical and empirical framework for understanding how plants mediate herbivore population growth will be produced, thereby motivating new lines of inquiry in ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SWS recognizes the need to reach out to underrepresented groups to provide intellectual opportunities for personal growth and development. Attendance at scientific meetings can often provide the intellectual spark, along with the opportunities to make contacts for the future, that encourage undergraduate students to continue their professional education beyond the Bachelors level. A major goal of the program is to open doors for these students. Diversification of ecologically oriented professionals is expected to promote better science and science applications as a result of the melding of more diverse perspectives. A summary of participant survey results will be published in the SWS bulletin, Wetland Science and Practice.<br/><br/>Attendance of a select group of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups at an annual scientific meeting provides each student with a perspective on and exposure to the breadth and depth of wetland science and personal contacts that cannot be obtained at a single academic home institution. Because SWS spans academic, government, and private consulting sectors, students are able to tailor their daily activities to their personal interests in wetland science. A variety of strategies (social events, field trips, mentoring, career development workshops, leadership training through ESA SEEDS) will provide guidance and boost self-assurance for award recipients that will lead to greater ethnic and racial diversification of the ecological sciences. By pairing undergraduate students with graduate student or faculty mentors at both the SWS and ESA annual meetings and by providing workshops and symposia oriented toward career development, SWS is fostering active participation and discussion, key components of advancing science and promoting the intellectual development of undergraduate students."

Building on a 90-year research history on ecology in natural and human-modified forests, the Luquillo LTER has shown that while tropical forests exhibit resilience to individual disturbance events, the potential combination of increased frequency of intense storms, like Hurricane Maria in 2017, and more frequent drought, may compromise ecosystem resilience in the long-term. The Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) combines long-term measurements, experimental manipulations, and computer simulations to determine the effects of changes in the frequency and intensity of disturbance events, such as hurricanes and droughts, on tropical forests represented by the Luquillo Mountains in eastern Puerto Rico, USA. During the next six years, the Luquillo LTER will document the impacts of Hurricane Maria, the most intense storm to impact the island in ninety years, on the forests of the Luquillo Mountains while continuing to evaluate the potential effects of increased drought predicted for the region. It is important to understand how tropical forests respond to these disturbance events because they play a key role in global carbon and water dynamics and provide essential ecosystem services, such as clean water and carbon dioxide absorption, to people worldwide. The Luquillo LTER will continue to train numerous undergraduate and graduate students, as well as secondary school students and teachers, especially members of underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of new multidisciplinary scientists and citizens who have the skills and experiences to address the pressing environmental challenges of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>The research tests hypotheses that changing disturbance regimes, interacting with the effects of past disturbance events, will result in new combinations of species and altered biogeochemical dynamics different from previous environmental conditions and characteristics.

Scientists call these lifetime movements ""dispersal"". While short-distance dispersal is common, long-distance dispersal is rare. Long-distance dispersal, however, plays an important role in nature -- it can help species survive when their habitat is destroyed, and can spread genes that they need to adapt to new conditions. Long-distance dispersal can also allow invasive species to spread quickly, leading to significant management costs and threatening native species. Scientists do not fully understand the factors that cause differences in dispersal distance, in part because it is difficult to track long-distance dispersers. This research will help people understand the causes and consequences of differences in dispersal distance by focusing on a salamander that lives in small, mountain streams. Because salamanders disperse along streams, and because even long-distance dispersers don't go very far (less than 500 meters), it is possible to collect information on dispersal (distance, timing, conditions before and after) that would be difficult and expensive to collect in other species. With this information, scientists and managers can better promote dispersal by native species, or prevent dispersal by invasive species. <br/><br/>This research will test whether dispersal distance affects individual performance (survival and growth), and how environmental factors (habitat stability and predation) influence those effects. The researcher will then test whether individual performance consequences predict population-level variation in dispersal distances (i.e., dispersal kernels), associated morphological, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes, and emergent patterns of population connectivity and range expansion. Because the research questions center on fundamental performance consequences, scaling relationships, and biogeographic processes, results will be informative across taxa. In particular, this work will help bridge plant and animal studies of dispersal by filling a common gap in our understanding of the scaling of dispersal data -- from individual traits to population-level dispersal distributions, and further to landscape and biogeographic consequences."

However, individuals who do not help their neighbors erode the benefits of group living, which can destabilize the group. In the long run, the balance of these forces leads some populations and species to live in complex groups while others live solitary lives. Examples of species living in complex groups include ant and bee colonies, hyena clans, and human societies. Mathematical tools from evolutionary biology and economics have been used to predict when the benefits of group living might outweigh the costs. Although these predictions can explain broad patterns across the tree of life, they have not been updated to incorporate recent advances in DNA technology. These advances have revolutionized how scientists understand the influence of genes on human disease and have also helped biologists link genes to social behavior and the propensity to act cooperatively in groups in many different animals species. This research will develop new mathematical and computational tools for the scientific community that will explicitly incorporate these data so that biologists can better understand the history and function of genes that affect social behavior and group living. This knowledge will not only shed light on the evolutionary origins of cooperation and conflict, it will help biologists dissect the genetic basis of group living, which is important for understanding the mechanisms by which changes in the social environment might negatively impact human health. Students of all ages will be supported by this research and gain important mathematical and computational training. <br/><br/>This research will bridge evolutionary theory for social behavior with population genomics by creating new mathematical and computational tools that specifically address the role of genetic linkage, recombination, and epistasis in the evolution of complex social traits.

When two parasite species occupy the same host, the outcome of infection may not be the same as when each parasite occurs separately, due to interactions between the parasites. This project will evaluate the consequences of co-infection for host health, the spread of disease, and host population biology, using a model organism that impacts food safety in stored grains. Additionally, this project will provide scientific training and mentoring to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students; identify factors that affect the agricultural control of pests and pollinators; and implement an outreach project to recruit women from under-represented minorities to fields in STEM.<br/><br/>The researchers will use mathematical models and laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of parasite co-infection on a flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) model host system. The first objective is to determine the mechanisms through which co-infecting parasites interact in order to evaluate the impact of co-infection on parasite growth rates and host infection outcomes. The researchers will manipulate host nutrient acquisition, alter parasite infection routes, and quantify the impact of co-infection on host immune response using next-generation mRNA sequencing. This objective will elucidate the importance of top-down (immune-mediated) versus bottom-up (resource-mediated) ecological interactions for structuring parasite communities within the host. The second objective is to quantify the impact of infection order and the strength of within-host interactions on the transmission of each co-infecting parasite to new flour beetle hosts, connecting within-host to epidemiological processes. The final objective is to develop mathematical models of Tribolium population biology that predict how co-infecting parasites influence host population dynamics and parasite persistence, based on the experimental data. This project will provide novel and generalizable insight into the wider ecological context of co-infection and the impact of dynamical feedback across scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aggressive territorial interactions between species are very common, much more so than expected based on current theory, and may determine whether species are able to coexist. The importance of understanding the causes of such costly interactions is highlighted by evidence that the ranges of many species are changing rapidly. One potentially crucial factor that has generally been overlooked is reproductive interference. Reproductive interference occurs when a male or a female of a species recognizes a male or female of a different species as a potential mate. This mistake has negative impacts on the fitness of both species. Reproductive interference is effectively a form of mate competition and thus may be the root cause of territorial aggression between species in some cases. By developing new theory and testing it with new empirical research on dragonflies and birds, this project will advance our understanding of why aggression between species is so prevalent.<br/><br/>This research aims to clarify the factors that determine whether interspecific territoriality is evolutionarily stable or transitory. An individual-based modeling framework that the researchers have developed for studying the consequences of secondary contact between closely related species will be extended to evaluate the consequences of reproductive interference between (1) species in which males defend mating territories, and (2) species in which males defend multi-purpose territories. Rubyspot (Hetaerina spp.) damselflies are the ideal study system for testing the first of these new models. It has already been established that interspecific territoriality covaries with reproductive interference in this genus, but further research is needed to determine whether the variation in reproductive interference explains the variation in interspecific aggression. Fieldwork will be carried out to parameterize the model and to test its predictions on 10 species pairs. The second model, for species that defend multi-purpose territories, will be based on the biology of socially monogamous passerine birds, and parameterized using data from the literature, to evaluate whether current levels of resource competition are sufficient to maintain interspecific territoriality in the absence of reproductive interference. Finally, a major comparative study of North American passerine birds will be carried out to elucidate the ecological, phenotypic and phylogenetic correlates of interspecific territoriality. This work includes substantial international fieldwork experiences for students in Costa Rica and Mexico and is partially funded through the Global Venture Fund."

Group size has many important consequences, such as affecting the spread and transmission of infectious diseases both within the group and to members of other groups.  This project seeks to understand why groups of variable size persist over long-term time scales.  As we better understand what promotes variability in group size, we can better predict the extent to which the costs or benefits of group living will change over time.  One popular but untested hypothesis is that climatic differences between years cause variation in food supply or in populations of parasites and pathogens, and this in turn causes the payoffs of different group sizes to vary annually. This project builds on a long-term study of a social bird, the cliff swallow, which lives in colonies of widely different sizes, and seeks to investigate whether changing selection on the animals' survival and reproductive success can explain annual variation in group size.  The research addresses one of the most fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology. <br/> <br/>This project will test the prediction that success of individuals will increase with group size in some years, decrease with group size in others, and remain unchanged in yet other years.  It will be determined to what degree the birds' annual nesting success varies from year to year in colonies of different sizes.  This will be investigated by systematically collecting data at 20-25 colonies each year.  The work will determine the causes of variation in reproductive success by measuring the extent of parasite infestation, time of breeding, bird condition, and other factors. This study will promote better understanding of how group size affects individuals' lifetime reproductive success across long-term time scales, assist in interpreting the extensive variation in group size that is characteristic of many organisms, and reveal the potential influence of recent climatic changes on social behavior.

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease.  Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies. It will also train and educate numerous, undergraduates and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/>This research builds on data from a long-term study of the population dynamics of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae and Rana muscosa) in the complex landscape of the California Sierra Nevada, and the impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as it has invaded and spread through hundreds of frog populations. In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions. In some cases however long-term persistence of frog populations occurs with Bd in an enzootic state in which the impact of the pathogen is greatly reduced. The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence. Cutting-edge genomic analysis of existing swab samples will be combined with continued surveys of field populations to identify new disease outbreaks and describe the transition from outbreak to enzootic state, collection of Bd cultures and frog mucosal samples from field populations, and laboratory experiments on Bd virulence and frog"

Acquisition of resistance to antibiotics in bacteria is one of the many ways in which such gene swapping impacts society. Because of the potentially tremendous benefit to their survival, bacteria have developed a large arsenal of mechanisms for gene trade. One enigmatic gene exchange mechanism involves shuttling genes packaged in particles (so-called Gene Transfer Agents) that resemble bacterial viruses. This raises many questions about the origin and functionality of this mechanism. How beneficial is it to exchange genes this way? Do Gene Transfer Agents represent former viruses that were ""domesticated"" by bacteria?  Bacterial viruses are numerically the most abundant organisms on Earth. Could many of these viruses in fact be Gene Transfer Agents? Answers to these questions will advance our understanding of how gene exchange contributes to bacterial adaptation. Because of accumulating evidence that Gene Transfer Agents are of use to a microbial population as a whole rather than to an individual cell, this project will also advance our knowledge on the origin and maintenance of cooperation, a long-standing mystery of evolutionary biology. Since bacteria and viruses are key players in all Earth environments, including human bodies, the project will benefit both the scientific community and broader society. <br/><br/>Researchers at Dartmouth College will investigate the above questions via computational analyses of genetic information from marine bacteria. Those bacteria are key players in Earth's nutrient cycling and ocean habitability. Genes encoding Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) will be identified and extracted from bacterial genomes and oceanic metagenomes. These GTAs will then be rigorously compared to similar genes from bacterial viruses. The comparison will assess the GTA's evolutionary relationship to viruses and the selective pressure exerted on their genes by bacterial hosts.  Given the recent discovery of the GTA system and its resemblance to actual viruses, many true GTAs in available genomic sequences could be mistakenly annotated as integrated bacterial viruses. To address this important issue, the researchers will develop a novel bioinformatic method that aims to successfully distinguish Gene Transfer Agents from their viral counterparts. Ultimately, this cross-disciplinary project will contribute to better understanding of oceanic and global elemental cycles and of adaptive evolutionary processes that drive bacterial populations in marine and other environments.

For example, passenger pigeons were once abundant throughout North America, but no longer exist. We often know about the factors that cause a widespread species to decline (in the case of the passenger pigeon, the original cause was hunting), but we know much less about what causes some populations to recover, and others not to do so, once that original cause of declines is gone. Monarch butterfly populations have declined dramatically in North America, and now western populations may be approaching extinction. In the 1980?s, millions of monarch butterflies overwintered on the California coast, and bred during the summer west of the Rocky Mountains. By the 2000?s, the overwintering population had declined to ~200,000-300,000 butterflies. In 2018, the population dropped to ~30,000 butterflies. This RAPID project will use the unexpected, rapid decline of western monarch butterflies to test theories of extinction risk. We will evaluate what changes in this suddenly-small population, through a combination of carefully controlled experiments and sightings reported by volunteers looking for monarch butterflies throughout the west, especially in California. We will use this knowledge to help guide management and recovery of this iconic butterfly population.<br/><br/>The research will test the hypothesis that vital rates, like survival and reproduction, decline as populations become very small, perhaps because individual animals have difficulty finding mates, or cannot protect themselves from predators as well as they could in groups. If very small populations decline due to these ""Allee effects"", there is a fleeting window of time in which to study population dynamics before local population extinction. Because we know so little about suddenly-small populations, ecologists typically base conservation plans on predicting declines to a ?quasi-extinction threshold?, in other words, a population size below which the species is unlikely to be able to recover. Based upon estimates of survival on overwintering grounds and reproduction in early spring, earlier work warned that 30,000 butterflies may be a quasi-extinction threshold for western monarchs. This project will (1) Test whether winter survival and spring reproduction are now lower than they were in the past; (2) Calculate rates of summer range expansion, and compare 2019 to years in the recent past, to evaluate potential reductions of survival, reproduction, or movement at other life stages; (3) Combine results of (1) & (2) with existing data to model dynamics of this migratory population through its full annual cycle.

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania.

Recent studies have found that, compared to common species, rare tropical tree species suffer more from pathogens that are specialized to a single host species that then spread rapidly through dense patches of seedlings of that single host. This research will test the novel hypothesis that rare species are more strongly impacted by host-specific pathogens because they have lower diversity of resistance genes at the population level, such that all their seedlings will be susceptible to the same suite of pathogens, promoting rapid pathogen spread and increasing mortality rates. This hypothesis will be tested using experimental greenhouse and field studies, combined with genetic analyses that will quantify the diversity of resistance genes for rare and common tree species in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Computer simulations will also be used to examine whether the measured differences in resistance gene diversity would impact infection levels, mortality rates and local abundance of tree species. Results of this study will improve understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, with potential applications for agriculture and horticulture (e.g. increasing pathogen resistance in crops). Hands-on training in cutting-edge genetic techniques would be provided to a wider audience through a summer workshop for students and faculty. <br/><br/>This study will be the first to obtain large transcriptome datasets from a tree community and will provide gene sequence data that will be informative for future studies of genetic diversity in tropical forests. Examination of the effects of resistance gene diversity on forest dynamics will bridge the gap between molecular evolution studies that indicate ongoing selection for multiple resistance genes at many loci, and how this diversity functions in nature. Furthermore, this study is likely to bridge competing theories for tropical plant diversity by providing a genetic explanation for why rare tree species are more strongly controlled by their species-specific enemies, while simultaneously supporting dispersal limitation as a feature determining which species are locally dominant. Ultimately, the study should elucidate whether local rarity restricts local genetic diversity, which in turn reinforces local rarity, a cycle that can be escaped only by recruitment of new alleles via long-distance pollen or seed movement. Demonstrating such a coupling between the ecological and genetic features of populations would bring new perspectives and avenues for theoretical advances in evolution and ecology.

Early work emphasized the importance of geographic isolation to limit gene flow among populations. Without gene flow, populations might then evolve into new species over long periods of time. More recent work has focused on the role of natural selection in accelerating the evolution of species, with or without gene flow among populations. This project tests a new idea, that the rapid evolution of new allosomes can accelerate the rate of speciation in some lineages. The researchers will focus on the exceptionally diverse lineage of cichlid fishes found in tropical areas around the world. More than 2,000 species of cichlid fishes are known, making them the most rapidly speciating lineage of extant vertebrates. Recent work has revealed unexpected diversity in the allosomes of these fishes. This diversity may be due to a unique behavior in which females mouthbrood eggs and larvae for periods of up to three weeks. The associated differences in behavior and physiology between males and females causes different genetic changes to be favored in males and females. This pattern is known as genetic conflict. This project will test the hypothesis that these genetic conflicts are responsible for the rapid evolution of new allosomes. In turn, this rapid evolution is thought to be important in the rapid rate of speciation in this group. The project will promote scientific exchange between the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil.  It will also provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students at University of Maryland. <br/><br/>The researchers will use genomic techniques to characterize allosomes in cichlid fishes from Africa and South America. Regions of genetic differentiation between males and females will be identified using whole-genome DNA sequencing. Long-read sequencing technology will be used to characterize changes in the sequence and structure of chromosomes during the early stages of allosome evolution. Comparative phylogenetic analysis will be used to determine whether high rates of allosome turnover are associated with life history traits. The specific focal trait is female mouthbrooding, which correlates with antagonistic selection between males and females. To determine whether evolutionary changes in allosomes create genetic incompatibilities the researchers will measure the fitness of hybrids between species with different allosomes.

It is a highly damaging pest of hardwood forests, causing extensive economic and ecological damage to public and private property, as well as negatively impacting the forest products industry. In some parts of its range, gypsy moth is spreading rapidly across the landscape, while in other areas, the invasion front is static or retracting. So far, only one-third of susceptible forest types in the United States have been invaded, leaving large portions of the country still at risk. This project addresses how the invasive potential of a species can change along its leading edge and how a changing environment can determine whether ranges expand or contract. This research also includes training and outreach components that will reach a wide range of student learners, educators, and community stakeholders.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to use patterns of expansion, stasis, and contraction at gypsy moth range limits to examine how local changes in gypsy moth traits influence the potential for future spread. Specifically, the project tests for range-wide variation in tolerance to high and low temperature extremes, local adaptive changes in those physiological limits, and how these traits interact with temperature to influence invasive spread under predicted changes in regional environments. To determine how temperature extremes impact the survival and growth of populations from across the invasion front, experiments will be performed to quantify temperature-dependent growth rates, critical thermal limits, and temperature-specific metabolic rates. Additionally, the effects of current and future environmental conditions will be tested using growth chambers programed with region-specific current and future temperature regimes. The effects of current overwintering conditions at the range extremes on hatching success will be tested by deploying egg masses from a range of populations at both the northern and southern range edge. Publically available climate data, as well as the exhaustive sampling effort by state and federal agencies that annually measures the abundance of gypsy moth along the entire 2000 km range edge, will be used to examine future spread potential. These experimental approaches, combined with information on the current distribution and spread rate will lead to a greater understanding of traits underlying the success of invasive species and help to identify areas that may become more or less susceptible to invasions in the future."

One of the most well-established forms of natural plant defenses are traits that recruit animals to defend the plant against its enemies in return for food and/or shelter. These reward traits can substantially reduce plant damage, but the benefits they confer can vary over different conditions, and some plant species have even evolved to lose reward-traits over time. This research focuses on understanding the dynamics of reward trait evolution using mite domatia (small structures on plant leaves that house beneficial mites). In the right context, mites housed in domatia protect the plant by cleaning the leaf surface of microbial pathogens and small herbivores. Mite domatia appear in ~24% the world's flowering plant families, and are found in many economically important groups, including coffee, cherries, and grapes. Grapes (genus Vitis), are especially interesting, as some species have mite-containing domatia that defend the leaves, while other species, including many of the most economically important grape species, do not. This research leverages the natural variation in domatia seen in wild grape species to understand how plant traits affect leaf communities.  The genetic and environmental contexts in which plants successfully use beneficial mite populations to naturally defend themselves against pathogens and herbivores will be identified. The research will lead to a better understand of the interactions among grapes, their herbivores, beneficial arthropods, and the leaf microbiome. Data will be disseminated freely to the public and will have the potential to enhance grape agriculture and breeding, and potentially other important crop species. The project will also train a post-doctoral researcher and graduate student in diverse field and laboratory methods and analyses, and develop tools to better integrate research products in undergraduate biology classes.<br/><br/>This project will examine how leaf micro-structure impacts multi-trophic phyllosphere communities within and across Vitis species, and will investigate how phyllosphere dynamics can feedback to impact plant fitness.

This project will investigate the roles of host, pathogen, and environment to understand how the pathogen - host interaction evolves and contributes to the differences in anthrax occurrence between two study areas. The two areas, both in southern Africa, have very different anthrax outbreak dynamics, which are representative of variation in anthrax systems world-wide. In Etosha National Park, Namibia, there are smaller outbreaks, affecting grazing zebra, annually in wet seasons. In contrast, in Kruger National Park, South Africa, larger outbreaks affecting browsing kudu occur in dry seasons on roughly a decadal scale. The project builds on detailed records of disease and population dynamics in each park as well as archived pathogen samples and will involve new data collection and analyses and mathematical modeling to understand these different dynamics. Education, training, and scientific and public outreach are essential components of this research. Postdoctoral researchers and undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds will be trained in field, laboratory, and quantitative techniques emphasizing cutting-edge genomics, and statistical and dynamic modeling approaches. <br/><br/>The causative agent of anthrax (the bacterium Bacillus anthracis), is often invoked as a textbook example for the evolution of high virulence and prolonged environmental survival. This project will link within-host, between-host, and in-environment processes, to understand how conflicting selective pressures impact pathogen diversity, host resistance, disease incidence, and ultimately, how these processes may drive host-pathogen co-evolution. This collaborative research team will compare anthrax dynamics in two wildlife systems, integrating long-term field studies, host and pathogen genomics, microbiology, and statistical and dynamic modeling. The project addresses three related questions: (1) how does pathogen diversity affect trade-offs between pathogen transmission and virulence? (2) how does host diversity affect trade-offs between pathogen transmission and virulence? and (3) how do landscape-scale patterns of transmission and host movement affect virulence-transmission trade-offs and host-pathogen population dynamics? Researchers will link variability in B. anthracis genomes to phenotype (i.e., pathogen survival in the environment, virulence to hosts, and transmission across host and geographic range). Researchers will identify host genes under pathogen-mediated selection in two primary host species, plains zebra (Equus quagga) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros). Researchers will build landscape-level models of epidemiology and population dynamics incorporating host movement, transmission routes, pathogen virulence, and host resistance.  Finally, researchers will build models predicting anthrax transmission dynamics across ecosystems. In a broader sense, this research will facilitate the development of predictive tools to better manage public health and related policies for complex, multi-host zoonotic diseases such as anthrax.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the extent to which diversity at different levels of biological organization in host and microbiome communities influence functional diversity within ecosystems represents a considerable gap in our understanding of global biodiversity. This project will represent a landmark in understanding what generates and maintains biodiversity in river ecosystems. Freshwater mussels are a highly imperiled, species-rich group of animals that play critical roles in rivers through their filter-feeding and cycling of nutrients. Although the ecological value of freshwater mussels is widely appreciated, little is known about how factors like genetic diversity of individual species, species composition and diversity of mussel communities, or interactions between mussel communities and their gut microbiomes structure these ecological processes across environments and geographic scales. Similarly, little is known about how host-microbiome interactions have structured the evolution of both groups over time. If the processes and mechanisms underlying patterns of biodiversity in these animals can be identified, managers will be better armed to make informed decisions for conservation and restoration efforts that will ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem. <br/><br/>Using approaches that scale from individual-to-population-to-species levels and above, this project seeks to understand ecological and evolutionary associations among the environment, genetic diversity, functional traits, and community assembly across both host and microbiome phylogenies in contemporary taxa and ancestral lineages. This research will integrate analyses of (1) intraspecific genetic diversity in a suite of freshwater mussel species, (2) phylogenetic diversity of communities of mussel species as well as their associated microbiomes, and (3) functional diversity of the mussel-microbiome holobiont. Integrating these three dimensions of biodiversity will allow us to comprehend the mechanisms that underpin the roles that freshwater mussels play in ecosystems, and to understand the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that structure biodiversity in space and over time. Furthermore, this work will extensively populate public databases with new data on species distributions, abundances, microhabitat environmental characteristics, and DNA sequence variation that will have impacts on basic evolutionary and ecology research while also informing conservation and management of a highly imperiled and ecologically important group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently revised estimates of riverine outgassing suggest that it is a significant component of the global carbon cycle. But precisely how much outgassing occurs and what factors control the rates of outgassing remain poorly understood, especially in the lower, tidal reaches of large tropical rivers. Most measurements of outgassing are made far upstream of the ocean, and oceanography studies are restricted to zones that are offshore. This leaves a major knowledge gap, with little or no data available for extensive river reaches between upstream gauging station and offshore sites where oceanographic research vessels pick up the signal at sea. This project, with a focus on the Amazon River, will provide greater insights into how riverine carbon cycles function, and ultimately their influence on global cycles. The coupled models developed for the project will be available to policy makers for use in evaluating broader water resource issues of the changing Amazon basin.  The project will support the training of one graduate student and an undergraduate student recruited from an underrepresented minority. <br/>   <br/>This research will use a combination of river boat expeditions, remote sensing, and modeling to test the hypothesis that dissolved CO2 levels remain above atmospheric saturation along the entire lower river and in the inner reaches of the plume.

The hypothesis that gaseous, dissolved, and particulate concentrations of carbon vary consistently with the tide will be evaluated through detailed measurements over tidal cycles. To obtain insights into the biological mechanisms regulating organic matter decomposition and energy production a combination of proteomic signatures of microbial metabolism and dissolved organic matter characterization by ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry will be employed.

This dominance is largely due to the evolutionary success of one group, the Pentapetalae, characterized by whorled flower parts in multiples of five, which account for over 70% of described species. In contrast, flower parts are arranged in multiples of three (monocots, for example), two, or a variable number in less abundant groups of flowering plants.  The shift to whorled pentamery of the Pentapetalae occurred about 100 million years ago, and appears to have been one of the most successful evolutionary innovations of not only flowering plants, but of green plants in general. This research will investigate the evolution of the underlying genetic changes that contributed to this ancient evolutionary event. It promises to discover the new and/or modified genetic pathways that produced the typical Pentapetalae flower, one of the major mysteries of plant evolution. Several undergraduates will be trained in phylogenetic and molecular biology methods and analyses, and high school teachers will participate in the research through a summer workshop.  Data generated will be shared freely online and will provide tools for other researchers and the public to investigate other questions about flowering plant evolution. <br/><br/>The researchers will sequence genes expressed during flower development in a phylogenetically representative sample of flowering plants and employ state-of-the-art transcriptome analysis techniques to achieve three major goals. Firstly, phylogenetic relationships among lineages subtending the Pentapetalae clade will be reconstructed. Robustly resolved phylogenetic relationships of the lineages preceding the shift to the pentamerous whorled flower are currently lacking but pivotal to interpreting the evolutionary sequence of genetic changes that underlie this key morphological innovation. Secondly, several comparative methods will be used to identify, date, and determine the evolutionary impact of whole-genome and/or gene duplication event(s) that predate the origin of the Pentapetalae. The occurrence of whole-genome duplication events prior to Pentapetalae is widely acknowledged but their precise positions are uncertain. Lastly, RNA-seq and in situ hybridization approaches will be used to infer spatial patterns of gene expression in non-Pentapetalae versus Pentapetalae flowers to identify gene expression changes that correlate with a shift to whorled pentamery in the latter. Together, this integration of approaches will provide exciting new insights into our understanding of flowering plant evolution"

Such impacts are especially likely near the equator, where the temperature is always high and seasons can swing dramatically between ""wet"" and ""dry"".  This project will test how a tropical bird manages to thrive in an area that experiences periods of extremely high rainfall.  This type of study is important for helping us understand how changing climate may impact animals, especially in places like the tropics that contain a large number of species that are found nowhere else.  Results of this research have the potential to change how we view the role of climate in the lives of tropical organisms. <br/><br/>One of the classic paradigms in tropical ecology is that year-round warmth and humidity frees organisms from climatic stressors and constraints, releasing them from energetic limitations and heightening the importance of biological interactions in shaping life history and behavior. This project is intellectually risky because it challenges this deeply entrenched view. The investigator proposes that precipitation extremes limit fitness and tests the hypothesis that precipitation-fitness relationships are unimodal. The work builds upon more than a decade of studies on a small, tropical, frugivorous, lek-breeding bird -- the White-ruffed Manakin (Corapipo altera) -- in Central American montane forests. The investigator will elucidate responses of manakins to variation in long-term mean precipitation regimes and short-term rainfall events across populations spanning moderately wet to extremely wet forests on both the Pacific and Caribbean slopes of Costa Rica. Mechanistic links will be sought between high rainfall and manakin survival, body condition, and reproduction.  Additionally, previously-documented reproductive behavior and lek attributes will be contrasted with data from two new focal populations on the Caribbean slope, testing proposed climatic constraints on sexually-selected behavior at leks.

The intensity of UV light reaching Earth has increased greatly during the 20th century and may continue to increase, especially in some regions. This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.  Pollination effectiveness, in turn, is important for the economic success of many agricultural crops and for the ecological well-being of all flowering plants. This project will also provide research experiences and mentoring for students from underrepresented groups, and will engage the general public through outreach activities at multiple events.<br/><br/>Researchers will test the prediction that temporal increases in UV-B radiation have driven increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation in the petals of flowers. Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions.

Under optimal conditions, an intact coral reef can provide an abundant supply of food resources to coastal communities. However, overfishing, pollution, environmental change, and economic globalization are currently transforming reefs and the surrounding communities, placing both the health of the reef and the health of people at risk. This research seeks to understand the interactions between coral reefs and human communities. The project seeks to identify effective reef management practices that lead to levels and types of seafood consumption that promote human nutrition.

Through this convergent research, the investigators will develop generalizable principles that can lead to harmonious management of the health of fisheries and seafood-dependent people. <br/><br/>This award will identify the environmental and economic factors that lead to the decline in reef-based food systems. In addition to filling key gaps in our understanding of the human health impacts, this project will advance social-ecological trap theory by empirically testing the extent to which certain feedbacks produce trap dynamics and estimating critical drivers of transitions. To accomplish this, the investigators will dovetail their research efforts with a scheduled socio-economic survey. This project offers a unique quasi-experimental design to study roughly independent and isolated yet culturally similar sites, along a gradient of reef health, market access, and fisheries management strategies. Researchers will collect data on fisheries management approaches and the current status of reef fish and conduct clinical health surveys to determine levels of anemia, obesity, diabetes, and other nutritional disorders that can arise from lacking seafood in one's diet. This award will address pressing questions about the thresholds for reef transitions; the feedbacks between the diversity and abundance of reef-based fisheries; and fisheries activities, management, and consumption.

Zoonoses currently account for approximately 75 percent of all emerging infections worldwide. However, the factors that trigger zoonotic disease emergence and spread remain poorly understood, in part because they involve multiple species, complex inter-species and intra-species relationships, and many interacting environmental, behavioral, social, and economic factors. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents a case in point. MERS-CoV was first identified in human beings in 2012 and has killed 36 percent of those infected, but little is known about what has led to its emergence. For example, several human cases have been traced to contact with camels imported from Africa; studies also have detected MERS-CoV in African wildlife; and while camels are a known reservoir host for MERS-CoV, it is not known if there are additional reservoirs or intermediate hosts, or how frequently and under what conditions MERS-CoV spillover occurs. This project will investigate the natural ecology of MERS-CoV in relation to broader social, economic, and environmental changes; its potential wildlife reservoirs in close contact with camels; and the potential for spillover to humans who consume, herd, and trade camels and camel products. This work is of direct importance to national security with respect to disease threats; MERS-CoV is currently on the World Health Organization's priority shortlist of diseases in urgent need of accelerated research.  <br/><br/><br/>To understand when and under what conditions MERS-CoV emerges and spreads from animals to humans, the researchers ask, (1) How do social, cultural and behavioral characteristics of camel economics shape virus ecologies? (2) Which intra- and inter-species interactions increase MERS-CoV emergence and transmission? and (3) What climatic and environmental variables are associated with transmission? Researchers will conduct field studies of wild and domestic (camel) reservoirs, collecting roughly 800 samples from targeted wildlife (ungulates and eulipotyphlads) over two years at four locations. They will carry out socio-behavioral studies across the camel value chain and follow individual camels longitudinally to determine when the same individuals seroconvert to MERS-CoV positive status. They will conduct laboratory analyses and do viral sequencing. The researchers will integrate the data into mathematical models using the 'Method of Plausible Parameter Sets' (MPPS), which will determine which mechanistic scenarios are consistent with observed patterns of MERS-CoV in camels and humans. This broadly inclusive approach expands upon traditional studies of zoonotic disease emergence. The transmission models will be applicable to other zoonotic diseases linked to livestock production and will help to identify interventions to reduce disease emergence and transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to their agricultural importance, grasslands also play key roles in diverse ecosystem services, including the production of clean water and the prevention of flooding. Native grasslands are often very species-rich, with richness increasing with increasing annual precipitation and declining following disturbance. These patterns of diversity can have important consequences because species-rich grasslands have been shown to be more productive and more resilient to unpredictable events like drought, flooding, or tornado damage. It is essential to understand the processes that govern both the patterns of plant diversity and the benefits of plant diversity to better manage grassland areas. The different processes that create and maintain the rich diversity of plant species coexisting in grasslands are unknown, but recent research suggests that plant pathogens may play a role. This project examines the extent plant disease determines natural patterns of plant diversity within grasslands by conducting parallel experiments at multiple field sites within the United States and China. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods, including students and faculty from colleges and community colleges adjacent to study sites in Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. Data from this project will generate new directions for the management of rangelands and also lead to improvements in the yield and resilience of agricultural and native ecosystems.<br/><br/>Pathogens are predicted to accumulate and limit plant productivity most strongly in grasslands with low plant phylogenetic diversity, low plant genetic diversity and high precipitation.

Specifically, patterns of plant and pathogen phylogenetic diversity, patterns of plant resistance due to genetic diversity, and patterns of ecological and evolutionary feedback will be tested across rainfall gradients in central United States and China. Rainfall manipulations of experimental plant communities will test environmental dependence of plant species coexistence, productivity benefits of plant diversity, and the role of pathogens as drivers of these processes. These empirical studies will be integrated with mathematical models to generate predictions of patterns and benefits of plant biodiversity, as well as predictions of vulnerabilities of grasslands to environmental perturbations."

For plants, the timing of seed germination determines whether individuals will survive and reproduce. The timing of germination also influences whether populations can persist in particular environments. Many plants use cues such as temperature, day length, and soil moisture to time germination during favorable conditions. Species differences in these cues may thus determine the climatic conditions in which a species can persist. In turn, these differences can shape their distribution across the landscape. How do responses of these cues evolve?  Will they continue to evolve if the environment changes? How do these patterns determine species persistence and distribution under current and future conditions? The research team will address these questions in Mediterranean climates within the California Floristic Province (CFP). The CFP is a biodiversity hotspot characterized by strong climate variability. This research will investigate how germination responses to environmental cues have evolved in a group of native CFP wildflower species. To do so, the team will use a combination of greenhouse experiments, genomic studies, and comparative analyses. The project will use data from historical collections and develop models to understand how these processes shape the distribution of these species across the CFP. The results will contribute a deeper understanding of how responses to environmental cues shape plant life cycles. This will provide insight into the forces driving trait evolution, population persistence, and species distributions. As part of the activities, three postdoctoral scholars, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students will receive research training and mentorship. <br/><br/>The research team will investigate functional, genetic, and phylogenetic diversity of germination timing in the Streptanthus (jewelflower) group.

This new model will be incorporated into existing demographic models for predicting population persistence and species distributions. Together, this research integrates three dimensions of biodiversity- functional diversity in traits driving life history responses to cues; genomic variation underlying that diversity, and divergence and constraint across the Streptanthus clade- to understand the evolution of the life history timing, and how variation in responses to environmental cues will influence the ecological function of population persistence and species distributions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project targets three economically important groups of organisms: plants in the pumpkin/cucumber family, true fruit flies that attack these plants, and parasitic wasps that kill the flies. These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both. This project is designed to uncover the mechanisms (evolutionary, ecological, and immunological) affecting interactions that may help explain the diversity of life. Many species of true fruit flies are major agricultural pests; this project will greatly increase knowledge about factors contributing to their susceptibility to parasitoids. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) defenses of parasites and their hosts affect diversification rates; 2) mechanisms of virulence differ among lineages, and 3) selection arising from predator-prey interactions can affect rates of species-formation. To discover and identify mechanisms of diversification, participants will generate and analyze molecular 1) high-resolution genetic data, multiple nuclear loci, and mtCOI haplotypes to delineate species, and resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships; 2) microsatellites and ddRAD-seq markers to discover and quantify fine-scale genetic diversity within and among populations; 3) phylogenies and field experiments to test hypotheses about mechanisms generating and controlling diversity on ancient, recent, and contemporary timescales. Undergraduate students from all participating colleges and universities will participate in the research."

In the following mass extinction event, non-avian dinosaurs, which had been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, did not survive. One surviving group was the mammals; yet, they did more than just survive, they in turn became the dominant vertebrates in most ecosystems. However, the scientific community still does not understand how mammals flourished in the post-extinction world. Numerous mammalian fossils from the first few million years after the extinction event have been discovered, including the first large mammalian herbivores. However, it is unclear how these unusual fossils relate to mammals alive today - are they direct ancestors or merely distant cousins? This project will focus on this neglected fossil record from the first 12 million years after the asteroid impact, a time characterized by high global temperatures and brief episodes of rapid global warming. By understanding what these extinct mammals were, this project will explore the true role of this extinction event in the evolution of mammals, examining which kinds of mammals survived, and how and why they recovered and evolved in a very rapidly changing climate. Today, Earth is experiencing a modern-day extinction event, as environmental change and human actions are threatening many species. Although the current circumstances differ from those 66 million years ago, understanding the underlying biological processes acting in a post-extinction world will guide us in the future.<br/><br/>Controversy surrounds the origin of placental mammals and the role of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event on their evolution, with evidence from morphology on the one hand and DNA on the other at odds. DNA-based studies argue for a Cretaceous placental origin, with the K-Pg event having little impact, whereas morphology-based studies argue for a Paleogene origin driven by the K-Pg event. Previous phylogenetic analyses of placentals have sampled heavily from older (Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene, 56 to 34 million years ago or earlier) taxa, but the sizable mammalian diversity from the Paleocene (66 to 54 million years ago) has been largely ignored. This project will correct this shortcoming by including most Paleocene lineages in a comprehensive phylogeny designed to directly address the controversy regarding the impact of the K-Pg event. Over 1,500 morphological characters, including some studied with computer tomography (CT), from 262 extinct and extant taxa will be combined with over 35,000 base pairs from 26 nuclear genes from extant mammals, and analyzed together using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methodology. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees will be used to resolve the origin of Placentalia and diversification of major subclades using divergence time analyses, and to estimate body size and morphological character evolution rates using model-based techniques. The evolutionary and diversity rates will be compared to paleoecological data to assess the impact of early Paleogene climate variation on mammalian history."

Recent studies have found that, compared to common species, rare tropical tree species suffer more from pathogens that are specialized to a single host species that then spread rapidly through dense patches of seedlings of that single host. This research will test the novel hypothesis that rare species are more strongly impacted by host-specific pathogens because they have lower diversity of resistance genes at the population level, such that all their seedlings will be susceptible to the same suite of pathogens, promoting rapid pathogen spread and increasing mortality rates. This hypothesis will be tested using experimental greenhouse and field studies, combined with genetic analyses that will quantify the diversity of resistance genes for rare and common tree species in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Computer simulations will also be used to examine whether the measured differences in resistance gene diversity would impact infection levels, mortality rates and local abundance of tree species. Results of this study will improve understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, with potential applications for agriculture and horticulture (e.g. increasing pathogen resistance in crops). Hands-on training in cutting-edge genetic techniques would be provided to a wider audience through a summer workshop for students and faculty. <br/><br/>This study will be the first to obtain large transcriptome datasets from a tree community and will provide gene sequence data that will be informative for future studies of genetic diversity in tropical forests. Examination of the effects of resistance gene diversity on forest dynamics will bridge the gap between molecular evolution studies that indicate ongoing selection for multiple resistance genes at many loci, and how this diversity functions in nature. Furthermore, this study is likely to bridge competing theories for tropical plant diversity by providing a genetic explanation for why rare tree species are more strongly controlled by their species-specific enemies, while simultaneously supporting dispersal limitation as a feature determining which species are locally dominant. Ultimately, the study should elucidate whether local rarity restricts local genetic diversity, which in turn reinforces local rarity, a cycle that can be escaped only by recruitment of new alleles via long-distance pollen or seed movement. Demonstrating such a coupling between the ecological and genetic features of populations would bring new perspectives and avenues for theoretical advances in evolution and ecology.

Recently, biologists have suggested that the sharing of genes and traits between different species (hybridization) may play an important, but overlooked role. If true, this not only calls into question our understanding of how species form, but changes how we evaluate the relationships between species. In this project, researchers from San Diego State University and UC Berkeley will link studies of phylogeny and behavior to understand the role of hybridization in the evolution of a large genus of jumping spiders (Habronattus) from North America. The team will develop genomic resources to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between species and to statistically test for the presence of hybridization in driving biodiversity patterns. Additionally, because hybridization occurs only when individuals of different species mate with each other, the team will examine the mating behaviors that control the exchange of genes and traits between separate species thus allowing insight into the mechanisms that drive larger evolutionary patterns. This project will advance our understanding of how species and populations of animals change and how we evaluate their evolutionary relationships. Research findings and techniques will be used to develop freely available statistical tools for scientists, online biodiversity databases, and educational spider-centric computer games to teach key aspects of systematic biology, in particular sexual selection and speciation. Two postdocs, one doctoral student, and multiple undergraduate students at three separate U.S. institutions will be trained on this project. Undergraduate students will play important roles in research, with high potential for independent projects.<br/><br/>This research will advance Habronattus research, and the field of introgressive hybridization biology, in multiple ways. At both phylogenomic and phylogeographic scales the researchers will quantify the balance between tree-like divergence and reticulate evolution, addressing whether phenotypic evolution is better explained by introgressive hybridization rather than a tree-based model. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be conducted to ask whether courtship complexity is correlated with rates of lineage diversification, introgression, and chromosome evolution. Finding widespread introgression concentrated in groups with the most complex courtship would contradict expectations of animal communication theory. Genomic-scale data will provide a consistent, objective framework for interpreting species limits, unbiased by male ornament ""conspicuousness"". At the behavioral level, the researchers will address the proximate mechanisms behind introgressive hybridization, addressing whether hybridization is best explained by errors in species recognition or selection for novel phenotypes. Large empirical genomic and phenotypic datasets will promote the development of new computer program modules to map phenotypic characters impacted by introgressive hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genome size is a measurement of the amount of DNA found inside the nucleus of a single cell. A puzzling question about genome size is why it varies so much in different organisms. The largest animal genome is over 3,000 times bigger than the smallest. Understanding the cause of these differences can provide important insights into the evolutionary processes and history that shaped organisms, since differences in genome size may be caused by organisms gaining or loosing genes or other parts of the genome. Genome size is also important to consider when planning DNA sequencing projects, as larger genomes require more resources than small ones. An important barrier to understanding the patterns that cause genome size variation is how few measurements there are. Currently, genome size estimates exist for only 0.4% of animal species. This number is so small due to how difficult it is to get a reliable estimate. Traditional methods rely on specially prepared cells from living organisms. However, live specimens can be difficult or impossible to obtain for species that are rare, endangered, or extinct. Fortunately, there are new methods to estimate genome size using DNA sequencing that do not require living tissue. This project will examine the reliability of DNA sequence-based genome size estimates on both live beetles and old, preserved specimens from museum collections. No previous experiments have specifically compared these methods or tested their reliability in old specimens. This project will also contribute additional data points for the broader study of genome sizes across the tree of life, and will further the use of museum collections in the study of the world's diversity. <br/><br/>Next generation sequencing (NGS) has given researchers a new set of tools for estimating genome size. This project will investigate the viability of NGS coverage-based methods for determining genome size in carabid beetles by performing flow cytometry and shallow Illumina sequencing on ten species of carabid beetle. It will also determine if genome size estimation by coverage analysis can be reliably employed on preserved material from museum collections by repeating shallow Illumina sequencing on old museum specimens of the same ten species. A total of 36 genomic libraries will be prepared and sequenced across four Illumina lanes. Coverage-based analyses will be performed on all resulting sequences, and the resulting genome size estimates will then be compared with those obtained by flow cytometry using a one-way ANOVA test to determine if coverage-based estimation is a viable alternative for both fresh and museum specimens. If shallow genome sequencing is successful in estimating genomes sizes, it will allow for the study of material from the world's natural history museums without the cost of extensive fieldwork to collect fresh material. This could potentially transform the study of genome size by increasing the number of species it is possible to analyze by orders of magnitude."

Surviving trees may experience legacy effects of drought: decreases in growth rates for multiple years. These trees may not fully recover before the next drought arrives, increasing the risk that more will die. One potential mechanism driving these legacy effects is related to how trees store and use sugars. Drought may change trees' ability to use stored sugars, because they are moved by water in tree tissues. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) will provide funds to compare trees under different levels of drought stress to understand how drought changes the availability of sugars in trees, and how these changes are related to tree growth rates and legacy effects, using tree rings and the age of sugars in different rings. This research is important because it will improve understanding of how trees respond physiologically to drought, which could improve predictions of how environmental change will affect forests. Accurate predictions about drought effects on US forests is critical for management of associated local (fire, flooding, etc.) and global (altered carbon cycling) negative impacts.<br/><br/>This study will address: (1) what are the effects of drought stress on storage dynamics of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in foundation tree species, and, (2) how are these dynamics related to legacy effects of drought in southwestern US forests? This project focuses on two foundational Populus species, because angiosperms exhibit complex drought legacy effects and are more reliant on NSC storage. Tree cores from 14 genotypes of Populus fremontii experiencing varying levels of apparent drought stress at the Palo Verde Common Garden were collected in 2015. Tree cores and respired CO2 will also be collected from Populus tremuloides individuals at four sites differing in drought stress across the Four Corners region. This study will analyze tree-ring wood and gas samples for 14C content to assess carbon fixation date, age, and availability of NSCs in tree rings of different ages, and for delta13C to assess drought stress. 14C and delta13C data will be related to ring widths and water stress/use indices using hierarchical models to understand the role of NSC dynamics in drought legacy effects. This study will develop an inexpensive, novel incubation method for obtaining CO2 for 14C analysis, bypassing existing difficulties with NSC extraction procedures. These isotopic methods will help elucidate links between drought stress and NSC storage, with implications for how foundation tree species will respond to climate change."

Notholaenids ferns become dormant during the dry season but quickly rehydrate and restore photosynthetic activity when moisture returns. This drought adaptation is hypothesized to be related to a waxy substance called 'farina', primarily composed of plant pigments, that form a whitish-to-yellowish layer on the leaf undersurface. When leaves curl up in response to water stress, this leaf surface is directly exposed to sunlight. Two primary functional hypotheses for the waxy layer have been proposed: 1) it acts as a 'barrier' to help reduce water loss from evaporation; 2) it acts as a 'sunscreen' to protect water-stressed leaves from damage caused by overheating and UV-radiation. This study aims to investigate the evolution and function of farina in notholaenid ferns and address a critical gap in understanding how plants cope with drought stress and high solar irradiance by using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, biogeographical, ecophysiological, and molecular phylogenetic approaches. These data will provide new insights into the functional role of farina on fern leaves and drought resistance more generally that may be applied to other plant groups. One graduate student will be trained in a diversity of approaches, and a new undergraduate training module will be developed using ecological niche modeling to investigate the patterns of plant evolution.   <br/><br/>This study has three primary objectives: The first is key to understanding the evolution of farina in this group, and involves reconstructing the interspecific phylogenetic relationships among notholaenid ferns using DNA sequences from both nuclear and plastid markers. Objective two will focus on Notholaena standleyi, a widespread species with three well-recognized flavonoid chemotypes. The phylogenetic relationships, flavonoid constituents, ploidy levels, and geographic distribution of these chemotypes will be explored to determine whether polyploidy and abiotic niche divergence have helped to shape their current parapatric distributions. Objective three will investigate the proposed ecophysiological functions of farina by measuring gas exchange rates, water-use efficiency, and photosynthetic-recovery rates after drought treatment, before and after removing the farina. Detailed anatomical and optical properties of farina will also be examined."

In addition to their agricultural importance, grasslands also play key roles in diverse ecosystem services, including the production of clean water and the prevention of flooding. Native grasslands are often very species-rich, with richness increasing with increasing annual precipitation and declining following disturbance. These patterns of diversity can have important consequences because species-rich grasslands have been shown to be more productive and more resilient to unpredictable events like drought, flooding, or tornado damage. It is essential to understand the processes that govern both the patterns of plant diversity and the benefits of plant diversity to better manage grassland areas. The different processes that create and maintain the rich diversity of plant species coexisting in grasslands are unknown, but recent research suggests that plant pathogens may play a role. This project examines the extent plant disease determines natural patterns of plant diversity within grasslands by conducting parallel experiments at multiple field sites within the United States and China. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods, including students and faculty from colleges and community colleges adjacent to study sites in Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. Data from this project will generate new directions for the management of rangelands and also lead to improvements in the yield and resilience of agricultural and native ecosystems.<br/><br/>Pathogens are predicted to accumulate and limit plant productivity most strongly in grasslands with low plant phylogenetic diversity, low plant genetic diversity and high precipitation. These predictions will be tested through a coordinated set of field observations, field manipulations, and greenhouse assays, performed on parallel diversity and rainfall gradients in North American and Asian grasslands. Specifically, patterns of plant and pathogen phylogenetic diversity, patterns of plant resistance due to genetic diversity, and patterns of ecological and evolutionary feedback will be tested across rainfall gradients in central United States and China. Rainfall manipulations of experimental plant communities will test environmental dependence of plant species coexistence, productivity benefits of plant diversity, and the role of pathogens as drivers of these processes. These empirical studies will be integrated with mathematical models to generate predictions of patterns and benefits of plant biodiversity, as well as predictions of vulnerabilities of grasslands to environmental perturbations."

From observing species in the present, for example, we know that competition can drive species to become different. Rather than remaining two species with similar sizes, those competing species can change, with one becoming larger or smaller than the other. Similar processes of change likely occurred in the past. There are other questions about past processes: how did the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs affect mammal evolution, how have human diseases evolved as humans settled more in cities, and so forth. Evolutionary biologists address these questions by writing a model to describe the process and then estimating aspects of the model: how strongly do species repel each other, what was the rate increase in mammals, how has virulence changed through time. However, for many of these questions, developing the models has been intractable, leaving these questions largely unanswerable. This project will develop tools to make creating these models much easier. It does so by using computers to simulate evolution under a particular model and tries adjusting the model parameters to best predict observed data, an approach known as approximate Bayesian computation. This will be enhanced by hackathons, intense meetings where scientists and developers gather to create or extend software, and which also serve to increase the programming skills and tools of biologists. An additional outcome of this project is the creation of an open course to teach cutting edge methods for understanding the past using family trees of current and extinct species.<br/><br/>This project combines new approaches for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for comparative methods as a way to implement new models with meetings to have new and experienced coders work together on projects (hackathons) as well as a new open phylogenetics course. The ABC approach will be written in R, given R's widespread usage in the comparative methods user community, and uses a discrete time model that allows biologists to code a model for movement in one generation and then uses this model on a phylogenetic tree. Prototype code is already available (package TreEvo) and will be developed under an open source model. Together, the research and teaching will speed up methods development, broaden the pool (in number and diversity) of people who can create new approaches to answer their questions, and strengthen phylogenetic training in general."

The role of insects in US grasslands and their responses to extreme drought is poorly understood. This is an important omission, because insects regulate grassland nutrient cycling, suppress primary production, and often achieve outbreak densities during severe droughts (e.g.  the Dust Bowl).

Finally, this research will produce a comprehensive and modern guide to grasshopper identification in Midwestern grasslands that will be of use to managers, researchers, and educators.<br/><br/>This project consists of two separate components. A manipulative field study will impose severe drought at three grasslands across a xeric to mesic precipitation gradient. Drought treatments will be combined with insect exclosures. Over three years, researchers will measure aboveground net primary production, nutrient cycling, plant physiology, plant traits, and insect herbivore densities. These data will be analyzed to identify the mechanism by which insects regulate production and nutrient cycling under ambient and drought conditions. A laboratory experiment will identify how both plant and insect physiology change under drought conditions. Physiological measurements will be incorporated into mathematical models to predict nutrient cycling under ambient and drought conditions in grasslands of the central US.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, forests worldwide are increasingly vulnerable to large-scale tree mortalities as the frequency rises of invasive pest and pathogen outbreaks. The near elimination of dominant tree species such as American chestnut trees in North America and elm trees in Europe and North America, as a result of introduced pathogens, highlights how diseases can fundamentally change the species composition of forests and lead to cascading effects on dependent animal communities. This project will measure how animal communities reliant on native Hawaiian forests change in response to a new fungal disease causing rapid and widespread mortality to the most ecologically important and abundant native tree. This research provides a unique opportunity to measure in real time changes to animal communities as a response to rapid and ongoing tree mortality, whereas most other studies documenting the effects of widespread mortality of tree species provide retroactive data long after declines. In this project researchers will directly involve underrepresented groups including Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders through the direct training of undergraduate students on the research project. This project will also convene educational events throughout Hawaii Island to communicate the research results.<br/><br/>Few studies have quantitatively documented how ecological communities in terrestrial ecosystems respond to the large-scale loss of a foundation species that mediates ecosystem processes and creates stable conditions for inhabitant species. Recent changes in forest structure are expanding across the Hawaiian landscape as a result of rapid, disease-induced mortality of ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), the foundation tree species of Hawaiian forests. The spreading fungal pathogen (Ceratocystis spp.) poses an immediate and serious threat to the diversity, structure, and function of Hawaii's remaining native forests and reliant plants and animals. Using advances in recording technology and soundscape analysis tools developed within the growing field of soundscape ecology, the researchers will rapidly assess changes in the biodiversity of audible birds, insects, and amphibian species in areas with different baselines and rates of change in ohia mortality across the landscape. The researchers will also evaluate whether the diversity and composition of other plant species within the understory mediates how animal communities respond to structural changes in the forest canopy. The simplified island ecosystem in Hawaii allows research to more directly tease apart the interactions that support community composition and function within forest ecosystems, which will have wide application to more complex and diverse systems that are experiencing large-scale forest tree mortality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is urgent to understand how biodiversity affects infectious diseases in wildlife. In some ecosystems, a more diverse community decreases disease risk, termed the 'dilution' effect because biodiversity dilutes out infection. However, in other systems, a more diverse community increases disease risk, termed the 'amplification' effect. When to expect dilution or amplification is a topic of debate among disease ecologists. This project aims to reconcile the competing effects of biodiversity on disease risk using Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in deer mice as a model, which displays aspects of both dilution and amplification in the same system at the same time. Researchers will examine how biodiversity can have competing effects by examining the underlying mechanisms, especially how competition between deer mice and other species in the community affects disease dynamics. This research will help unify the theories of dilution vs. amplification. It will also benefit society by advancing prevention efforts for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which has infected more than 700 people (and killed more than 250) since its discovery in 1993. HPS has disproportionately affected Native Americans, who will be involved in this research on tribal lands. <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that competition between deer mice and other small mammal competitors affects host density, contact rates among hosts, and the probability of transmission from an infected to an uninfected host given contact between them. Based on previous observational studies, SNV displays an overall dilution effect through a decrease in deer mouse density with increased small mammal diversity, but also a component amplification effect through an increase in the transmission rate (a product of the contact rate for a given host density and the probability of transmission given contact). Here, researchers will test whether competition between deer mice and other small mammals drives both of these observed patterns. Aim 1 will determine if the decrease in deer mouse density is a result of competition or some other aspect of diversity, habitat type, or environmental conditions, using Bayesian analysis of long-term population data. Aim 2 will determine experimentally if an increase in competition leads to stress and depressed immunity and/or changes in behavior and contact rates (which affect the transmission rate). Deer mouse and competitor density will be manipulated in enclosures and contacts, stress, and immunity measured. Additionally, dynamics in an unmanipulated natural population will be monitored to expand interpretation of the experimental study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another critical dimension of global change is biological invasions, which threaten biodiversity worldwide. This project connects two important dimensions of global change to test a novel hypothesis that urban adaptation may increase the success of biological invasions, which often have dramatic ecological and economic effects on the invaded habitats. This award will also support the STEM training of a postdoctoral researcher and numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Curriculum materials will be developed for K-12 education and outreach efforts will target the urban areas where this research will be conducted and where the research team members live. <br/><br/>The way organisms interact with their environment is expected to drive intense natural selection on their morphology and behavior. This work will study the crested anole lizard, which is native to Puerto Rico but established via human-mediated introductions in several places outside its natural range. This research will use field and laboratory studies to first test the hypothesis that a widespread lizard species is adapted behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically to urbanization. Second, the study will test if adaptation occurs at multiple life history stages, including embryos and juveniles. Lastly, the study will investigate a novel idea in invasion biology that adaptation to urban environments may predispose populations to become successful invaders of other urban areas, using molecular data to identify source populations. Detailed portions of the research will estimate thermal tolerance and examine behavioral thermoregulation in different habitats, use SNPs to identify the source population of the invaders, and examine habitat influence on development in the field. This research will help to establish whether or not adaptation to urban areas can facilitate the process of biological invasion, and will likely lead to conclusions that can be generalized across other urban tolerant species and biological invasions."

This project focuses on hemiparasites - plants that obtain resources both by making their own via photosynthesis and by stealing resources from the roots of other plants - to understand direct and indirect effects between plants and their herbivores. The novel twist here is that plants mediate interactions among different trophic levels, determining how a plant parasite affects a plant predator and vice versa. The research will have direct application to the management and recovery of two rare species: the hemiparasite is federally listed as threatened and the herbivore is an endangered butterfly. The investigators will partner with federal and state agencies to restore both species. This research will also provide research training to a post-doctoral research associate, a graduate student, and an undergraduate student. All will be actively mentored in responsible conduct of research, field and lab data collection, analysis, and outreach. <br/><br/>The organisms used in this study co-occur in grasslands of the Pacific Northwest US. Experimental mesocosms will be assembled that contain host plants, hemiparasites, and herbivores. Mesocosms will contain high or low numbers of plant species that can serve as hosts for hemiparasites. Hemiparasitism will be manipulated among plants, and herbivores will be allowed to feed on the hemiparasites in a subset of the mesocosms. Hemiparasite survival, biomass, and secondary chemistry will be measured to determine how they are affected by host community composition, and herbivore performance will be related to host plant community and to hemiparasite resources. Stable isotopes will be used to track fluxes of carbon and nitrogen from the host plant community to the hemiparasites, and through the hemiparasites to their herbivores. The research will exploit an ecologically understudied situation in which plants function both as producers and as consumers to provide new insights into how multi-trophic interactions structure ecosystems."

Elements (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) are the most common currency used by ecologists for measuring food web connections and comparing them across different ecosystems. Yet, other measures of diet such as macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrate, lipid, and protein) can also be useful because they provide more information on the quality of biochemical compounds. The overall goal of this work is to develop a framework for studying food webs that combines elements and macronutrients and then to test if this better predicts the amounts and types of nutrients transferred among organisms in food webs than elements alone. This research will focus on insects and other arthropods as they are some of the most diverse and abundant members of terrestrial ecosystems and a major food source for invertebrate and vertebrate predators. Better understanding how food webs function is an important goal for management of agricultural and natural ecosystem. During the course of this work, the project will also advance secondary STEM education by providing high school students and pre-service teachers with authentic research experiences and by training teachers in ways to incorporate research into classroom lesson plans.<br/><br/>This research will test two objectives important for better uniting elemental and macronutrient approaches to studying food webs. First, the project will test the long-held assumption that elements and macronutrients are correlated with each other in diverse arthropods, which preliminary data suggest may not be well-supported. Then, the project will test if a hybrid currency, macronutrient-partitioned elements, is a better predictor of the transfer of nutrients from prey to predator and the transfer of nutrients from arthropod carcasses to soil decomposers than elements alone. This work is intellectually risky because it represents a significant departure from two fields (i.e., ecological stoichiometry and nutritional geometry) that have traditionally measured nutrients differently (i.e., elements versus macronutrients).

As they grow, tropical plants take up large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, and store a substantial proportion of that carbon in their biomass and ultimately in soil. In addition, there is some evidence that plant growth will accelerate in the future with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, taking up and storing more carbon. However, it is unclear whether other plant nutrients are sufficiently plentiful in tropical forest soils to allow plants to grow as much as is predicted. In the tropics, soil phosphorus (P) concentrations are generally very low and such low P concentrations could strongly limit plant growth in the future. This research will explore how plants acquire phosphorus from soil, and which forms of phosphorus are actually accessible to plants. Experiments will explore how plant roots, bacteria and fungi ""mine"" nutrients from the soil, and will identify the specific microorganisms capable of accessing soil P. This work will be among the first to explore relationships between tree growth and different forms of soil P, it will improve understanding of the controls on biological P availability, and it will shed light on how pervasive P limitation is to plant growth in tropical soils. In addition, the project will enhance our ability to predict future rates of tropical forest productivity and could lead to improvements in how soil fertility is managed in tropical agricultural soils. Finally, the research will involve student training as well as promoting interaction between scientists and environmental journalists.<br/><br/>Knowledge of the true extent of nutrient limitation of plant primary production in the tropics remains incomplete, in large part reflecting our poor understanding of what forms of soil P are actually available to biological organisms. The proposed research will address the following overarching question: Are forms of soil phosphorus (P) that have traditionally been considered biologically unavailable actually available to plants and microorganisms? In the highly-weathered soils that dominate the lowland tropics, only a small fraction of total soil P resides in forms that are traditionally considered biologically available; the vast majority resides in more chemically and/or physically protected P pools that are presumed to be unavailable to plants and soil microbes. However, if plants and soil microbes can effectively overcome low soil P availability by accessing these recalcitrant forms of P that, until now, have been thought to be unavailable, then the extent of P limitation in the tropics could be less than current biogeochemical theory predicts. The proposed research includes a set of field, laboratory and greenhouse experiments conducted in a set of tropical forest sites in Panama. Together, the planned experiments have been designed to test the working hypothesis that P forms that have traditionally been viewed as unavailable are actually biologically available. Building on the experimental data, the research will culminate in a set of synthesis and modeling activities designed to explore how variations in soil P availability may affect future rates of NPP at ecosystem to global scales."

Peatlands are characterized by soils rich in organic matter that are often saturated with water, and are therefore often low in oxygen. These conditions often lead to the release of methane, a greenhouse gas with ~25 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, and peatlands are known to be important global sources of methane. Until very recently, peatlands were not expected to be a significant component of the Amazon basin since these wetlands are more common in cold, northern latitudes and there were few records of their existence in the Amazon. In recent years, however, multiple studies aided by satellite imagery and guided field explorations have documented hundreds of peatlands across basins in the West and Central Amazon. An estimated 3-6 millions of tons of organic carbon are contained in these newly discovered Amazon peatlands, which may also represent a significant, previously unrecorded, source of methane annually. The magnitude of organic carbon stored in plants and soils every year vs. that released as methane from these peatlands is not known. This project proposes to evaluate for the first time a set of diverse Amazonian peatlands their organic carbon content, and rates of forest productivity and methane formation and release. This work will also include experimental manipulations of water levels to evaluate responses of productivity and methane release to environmental changes likely to occur as the climate warms. This project will also develop mathematical models of these ecosystems to evaluate the impact of peatlands at larger scales and to propose quantitative predictions for future productivity and methane emissions. Two hypotheses will be tested in this study including (i) whether vegetation change and water regime determine methane production and release, and (ii) whether the response of methane production to altered water regimes is modulated by the diversity of Amazon peatlands. <br/><br/>This work will contribute substantially to our understanding of feedbacks between changes in atmospheric chemistry and climate because of the magnitude of carbon storage in Amazonian peatlands and their potential to be major sources of methane.

This project will also provide data on carbon stocks and fluxes for future comparisons under climatic change and will provide evidence to monitor tropical peatlands for future conservation and policy-making efforts. This collaborative effort including three US and one Peruvian institution, will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate and one undergraduate student. This project will also develop a virtual classroom program connecting high school students in Arizona and Iquitos Peru to discuss the impact of ecological research in Amazon peatlands and to track expeditions.

This research will focus on how microbiomes affect resistance of a host to another microorganism: a disease-causing fungus. By experimentally manipulating combinations of microbiomes, host species, and whether or not the disease-causing fungus is present, the researchers will be able to find out how microbiomes affect the ability of different plant species to compete with one another and to resist disease. By growing microbes found in natural microbiomes and by using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing approaches, they will begin to identify how important microbial players affect plant health. This project will involve the training of a graduate student in cutting-edge bioinformatics techniques.

Phyllosphere microbial communities, which reside in or on aboveground plant tissues, are similarly diverse, but current research suffers from an inability to connect presence and identity of phyllosphere microbes to larger ecological questions. In this project, researchers will test how pathogen infection alters the fitness and growth outcomes of con- vs. heterospecific phyllosphere microbial communities, with a focus on the fungal constituents of these microbiomes. Next-generation sequencing technologies will be combined with culture-dependent approaches to study the mechanisms of fungal community assembly in the phyllosphere. Functional trait data will be collected on select fungal cultures as metrics of plant-fungal and pathogen-fungal interactions. This trait-based approach will then be used to determine whether specific traits of the fungi measured in the lab can be used to understand their abundance and role on plants. This body of work has the potential to expand the scientific community's understanding of phyllosphere community assembly, and the mechanisms by which different phyllosphere communities inhibit or facilitate plant-species coexistence on their own or in conjunction with pathogens."

Isolation caused by construction of dams has resulted in two divergent alewife life history forms: the ancestral anadromous form that moves between lakes and the coastal ocean and a landlocked form that is resident in lakes. This project will combine advanced genomics, small-scale experiments, and whole-lake observations and experiments to document and understand the consequences of secondary contact, when dam removal allows reintroduction of anadromous alewife into lakes that contain the land-locked form. Close collaboration with the state agency that removes dams will allow the investigators to study secondary contact from its initiation. The project addresses three stages in response to secondary contact: rapid ecological change in planktonic communities and nutrient flux, rapid evolutionary responses in invertebrate populations in response to novel ecological conditions, and interactions between the two alewife morphs that may result in hybridization and, over the longer-term, alewife evolution and local adaptation. The first of these responses - ecological changes in lacustrine communities - is essential in order to interpret the evolutionary changes that result. The project is unique in its ability to capture the consequences of secondary contact on both time scales. Results will provide rare insight into feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in field populations following secondary contact with important implications for ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity in restored ecosystems."

Surprisingly little information exists, however, regarding the capacity of ecological systems to recover after introduced species removal. In particular, only a handful of studies on species invasions combine long-term, pre-invasion data with invader-removal experiments over temporal scales long enough to determine whether or not native species assemblages fully recover. This project will examine the reassembly of native ant communities following the landscape-scale removal of the Argentine ant, a common, widespread and ecologically disruptive introduced species. Following invader removal, researchers will quantify recovery of native ant assemblages with respect to their genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecological function. Multiple approaches, such as those to be employed here, are required to further clarify the rate and extent to which ecosystems recover from this type of environmental change. Broader impacts related to this work include research support for PhD students from UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, a research experience for undergraduates program for students from California State University, Channel Islands (a four-year Hispanic Serving Institution), and a high school outreach program focused on understanding ecological effects of invasive species. <br/><br/>The experimental removal of numerically dominant, introduced species can provide unparalleled opportunities to examine community reassembly. Invader-removal experiments can shed light on how reassembly is influenced by processes acting within a given system or, alternatively, reflects processes acting at larger spatial scales. The objectives of this research are to quantify the structural (genetic diversity, species diversity) and functional (trophic position, ecological function) components of the recovery of native ant assemblages following landscape-scale removal of the non-native Argentine ant. With large-scale eradication treatments on Santa Cruz Island, California, now complete, the project from this point forward will quantify native ant reassembly over a decadal time scale. The central hypothesis is that native assemblages will recover from invader removal but only if reassembly is measured over temporal scales (1) that are commensurate with the life history of focal native species, and (2) that encompass how interspecific interactions change during assemblage formation. This research will provide an unprecedented test of the capacity for native assemblages to regain structure and function after invader removal and also yield novel information about the factors that control the richness, composition and ecological function of an important terrestrial animal assemblage."

On a global basis, soils store twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere and regulate the nitrogen supply to maintain plant productivity while preventing excess nitrogen losses. Laboratory studies indicate that rhizosphere priming is likely a key control on soil CO2 emissions and the release of nitrogen from organic matter. However, the control of rhizosphere priming on soil carbon and nitrogen transformations in real ecosystems has been difficult to study and is not well understood. This is important because many environmental changes could alter rhizosphere priming, with potentially large consequences for carbon storage and nitrogen cycling. By measuring carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers in plants and soils, this study will follow the fate of different carbon and nitrogen sources and separate their contributions the functioning of the soil in grasslands of the central United States. This study also uses plants with different kinds of root characteristics to figure out the different influences plants can have on rhizosphere priming. Over three years, this study will address two main questions: (1) What is the magnitude of rhizosphere priming on the breakdown of organic matter under realistic soil conditions? and (2) How do different plant and soil characteristics affect priming across seasons, types of plants and different soils? This project is that start of a comprehensive effort to decipher and ground truth the important roles of of roots in actual grassland ecosystems.<br/><br/>The results of this project will help us understand how changes in plants and environmental conditions affect air quality and the loss of nitrogen from soils. It will train nine undergraduate students, three graduate students, and a post-doctoral scientist. Recruitment of participants will focus on underrepresented groups and build on existing programs in California, Kansas and Oklahoma to increase the diversity of the project participants. Results will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses in the three states and project data will be made available on a web site. This project will also help to enhance public education and awareness and to inform the general public of the importance of roots in providing essential services from our grasslands. Finally, the location and visibility of the experiment at the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site in Kansas offers unique opportunities for public education, including development of modules for the schoolyard programs and other outreach activities."

The islands of the Galapagos vary in age from young (less than 50,000 years old) to old (more than 4 million years old). This range in age can be used to study how biological diversity is shaped when communities are simple with few interacting species (on young islands), and when communities are more complex and characterized by numerous biological interactions (on older islands). This project will measure the rate at which new species are formed and diversity accumulates across a group of approximately 80 species of land snails forming the Galapagos's largest proliferation of species diversity. A combination of field and laboratory studies will be used to understand how the rate of evolution is influenced by the complexity of natural selection. A course for undergraduate students at the University of Idaho will introduce students to biodiversity patterns and guide them through the underlying evolutionary core principles generating these patterns using a series of field research excursions in the Pacific Northwest that is analogous to the Galapagos research expeditions. Students will also follow Galapagos research via Adventure Learning capsules (videos and integrated teaching material) which will guide and inspire them in the development of their own local research projects. Outreach activities also include developing a bilingual English-Spanish guidebook of Galapagos terrestrial snails, presentations and workshops for Galapagos park rangers, staff scientists, and guides, and disseminating research results in scientific publications, textbooks, magazines and the popular press.<br/><br/>Islands are living laboratories where evolutionary change is clear, tangible, and can be directly observed. On Galapagos, the number of selection pressures increases from young to old islands as species assemble in more diverse and complex communities. Although substantial research efforts have been devoted to quantify selection in simple environments, there is a need to characterize the effects and interactions of multiple selection pressures in complex natural biological systems, and the proposed work will fill this gap. The project will characterize variation in morphological and physiological traits of snails and quantify variation in multiple environmental factors for the approximately 80 Galapagos endemic land snail species of the genus Naesiotus and their mainland relatives. Species-level phylogenetic history of the lineage will be reconstructed to determine the number of independent colonization events that led to the diversity of Galapagos Naesiotus snails, and put the phenotype-environment association analyses in a phylogenetically-informed framework. The data will then be used to address hypotheses related to the effects of multiple selection pressures (i.e., increased complexity) on the rate of phenotypic change and adaptation in this lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fungi garner nutrients from the soil and exchange them for carbohydrates obtained by plants during photosynthesis. The vast majority of these plants also rely on animals for pollination. Plant interactions with these mutualists may be intertwined in important ways, but have most often been studied separately. This research will examine how mycorrhizal fungi affect plant traits important to pollination, and how the environmental context affects these interactions. These questions will be examined in an agricultural species of great economic importance in the United States - the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum).  Additionally, through existing farm-to-plate programs, relationships with K-12 teachers, and new collaborations with an agricultural outreach program, school children will be engaged in activities to learn about the importance of healthy below- and above-ground organisms, and high school and college students will be engaged in scientific research.<br/><br/>The project will examine if mycorrhizae affect floral traits important to pollinators in host genotype-specific ways.  Additionally, the identity and relative abundance of mycorrhizae will be examined for effects on floral trait expression in the host.  Mycorrhizal-driven differences in floral traits will be explored for their effects on pollinator visitation and resulting pollen limitation.  The links among mycorrhizae, floral traits, and pollination are hypothesized to depend on pollinator abundance, diversity, and identity. The work will capitalize on state-of-the-art molecular tools to understand if plant response to mycorrhizal fungi is dependent on the identity of fungal communities, and entail extensive field experiments to understand the importance of the native pollinator communities as well. To examine these hypotheses, highbush blueberry of two different cultivars (genotypes) will be inoculated with a commercially available inoculum or with soils containing native fungal spores and grown in pots in a common garden.  Once they flower, plants will be placed at six farms in Vermont alongside existing blueberry bushes.  Floral traits will be measured on each plant.  In addition, a pollen limitation experiment will be conducted to examine if mycorrhizal inoculation affects pollen limitation. Experimental plants, as well as others growing at each site, will be observed and the number and identity of bee pollinators will be recorded to assess site-specific differences in pollinator communities.

Unfortunately, these ecosystems are threatened by disturbances such as sea-level rise, land-use change, nutrient runoff, and ocean acidification. Changes in the spatial and temporal dynamics of processes regulating carbon fluxes could ultimately dictate the role of these ecosystems as net sources or sinks of carbon. The project will provide new insights regarding the biological and physical processes that regulate carbon fluxes in tidal salt marshes. The project also has a significant educational component that will integrate minority Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math undergraduate and graduate students into research, educational, and outreach activities. Specifically, the project will empower underrepresented students by providing research and networking opportunities, and to enhance social capital by strengthening the network of students, science professionals, and researchers. An outdoor laboratory will be maintained at a tidal salt marsh at the St Jones Reserve in Delaware, and the carbon cycle in salt marshes will be used as the engaging phenomenon to provide real-world learning, so students can explore, examine, and use science ideas to explain the ecosystem functions of salt marshes.<br/><br/>This project will integrate multiple sensors and techniques to better understand the processes and timescales that control carbon fluxes in salt marshes. By combining a variety of measurements such as micrometeorological techniques, near-remote sensing of canopy phenology with discrete sampling techniques of sediment and water carbon dynamics, this project tackles three interrelated research objectives. The goal is to investigate ecological processes underlying vertical and lateral carbon fluxes in salt marshes: a) assess the influence of plant phenology on ecosystem scale CO2 and CH4 fluxes, b) elucidate the role of sediment CO2 and CH4 on ecosystem fluxes, and c) determine the influence of tides (i.e., neap vs. spring tides) on vertical and lateral carbon fluxes. The project will provide educational opportunities for 8th grade students and will be aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Finally, the outcomes of this project will provide a baseline for interaction with science professionals and policy makers through outreach activities in collaboration with ongoing state and national initiatives."

Conflict arises because genes that are evolutionarily favored in males are disfavored in females, and vice versa. If these conflicts are difficult to resolve, then they will have profound impacts on the evolution of most species. However, the basic question of how to produce two different organisms from the same set of genes transcends evolutionary biology because it involves every step along the way from the expression of genes to the hormones that regulate the development of each sex.

In particular, plant root and shoot biomass - two important ecosystem attributes - are likely to influence the stability of hill slopes in complex ways. This project investigates the relationships between soil fertility, climate, ecosystem attributes, and slope stability in the Sierra de Las Minas, a mountain range in eastern Guatemala. This study area was selected because it is subject to periodic landslides and has a considerable history of previous research. The project integrates for the first time basic ecosystem concepts to better understand the evolution of landforms and landslides, suggesting that the division of vegetation biomass between roots and shoots is critically important. This is a highly interdisciplinary project that also will contribute to the engagement of women and underrepresented minorities in research and outreach, forge international collaborations, and provide for the dissemination of new knowledge that will be of interest to a wide range of stakeholders and scholars, including those interested in landform evolution, ecosystem and landscape development, carbon cycling, and sustainable management of regions subjected to landslide hazard.<br/><br/>Building upon previous work, this project takes advantage of the diverse lithologies and contrasting climates found in the Sierra de Las Minas, to test the overall hypothesis that variation in soil fertility inherited from different lithologies influences the partitioning of biomass between roots and shoots with consequences for slope stability, soil development, and ultimately landslide regimes. Variation in climatic conditions, however, may change the magnitude and direction of the observed effects. The work is organized around three specific goals and corresponding hypotheses: 1) examine the relationship between soil fertility and vegetation attributes that influence slope stability, 2) investigate differences in soil development trajectories in landslides underlain by different parent materials, and 3) evaluate the interactions between different soil fertilities and vegetation dynamics on landslides. These goals will be developed using a combination of geographic information systems and remotely sensed data, fieldwork, tree-ring studies, biogeochemical and geochronological analyses, and modeling."

In addition to their agricultural importance, grasslands also play key roles in diverse ecosystem services, including the production of clean water and the prevention of flooding. Native grasslands are often very species-rich, with richness increasing with increasing annual precipitation and declining following disturbance. These patterns of diversity can have important consequences because species-rich grasslands have been shown to be more productive and more resilient to unpredictable events like drought, flooding, or tornado damage. It is essential to understand the processes that govern both the patterns of plant diversity and the benefits of plant diversity to better manage grassland areas. The different processes that create and maintain the rich diversity of plant species coexisting in grasslands are unknown, but recent research suggests that plant pathogens may play a role. This project examines the extent plant disease determines natural patterns of plant diversity within grasslands by conducting parallel experiments at multiple field sites within the United States and China. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods, including students and faculty from colleges and community colleges adjacent to study sites in Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. Data from this project will generate new directions for the management of rangelands and also lead to improvements in the yield and resilience of agricultural and native ecosystems.<br/><br/>Pathogens are predicted to accumulate and limit plant productivity most strongly in grasslands with low plant phylogenetic diversity, low plant genetic diversity and high precipitation. These predictions will be tested through a coordinated set of field observations, field manipulations, and greenhouse assays, performed on parallel diversity and rainfall gradients in North American and Asian grasslands. Specifically, patterns of plant and pathogen phylogenetic diversity, patterns of plant resistance due to genetic diversity, and patterns of ecological and evolutionary feedback will be tested across rainfall gradients in central United States and China. Rainfall manipulations of experimental plant communities will test environmental dependence of plant species coexistence, productivity benefits of plant diversity, and the role of pathogens as drivers of these processes. These empirical studies will be integrated with mathematical models to generate predictions of patterns and benefits of plant biodiversity, as well as predictions of vulnerabilities of grasslands to environmental perturbations."

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Complementing these long-term observations, experiments and modeling will be carried out to understand feedbacks associated with browning and enhancing understanding of broader patterns of change in inland water bodies.

Researchers will combine comparative anatomical, phylogenetic, and genomic data from across the vascular plant tree of life to clarify how changes in the basic structure of a genome -its size- relates to the size of cells and, subsequently, how individual cells and entire organisms process energy. The project will train undergraduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups, and facilitate collaboration among project team members having diverse expertise, most of whom are early-career researchers. Societal benefits of the research include the potential for discovering a new, fundamental scaling law in biology as well as new pathways for developing more productive agricultural crops.<br/><br/>This project will test whether coordination between genome size, cell size, and metabolism represents a fundamental 'rule of life' that constrains the phenotypic diversity of organisms. Researchers will use vascular plants as a model system because its lineages have shifted repeatedly among C3, C4, and CAM photosynthetic metabolisms over evolutionary time and therefore provide multiple, independent tests of the overarching hypothesis. Researchers will determine the dependence of different photosynthetic metabolisms on genome-cellular allometry across about 360 vascular plants species that encompass multiple transitions among photosynthetic pathways. Sampling will include flowering plant clades known to have many C4 and CAM transitions, including the grass and bromeliad monocot families and the eudicot order containing cacti (Caryophyllales). Genome size and anatomical traits (leaf epidermal, guard cell and vein sizes and densities) will be quantified for all species. For a subset of species, the three-dimensional structure and organization of leaf cells will be measured using microCT imaging. Researchers will then characterize how vascular plant genomes have changed in size and composition by analyzing 288 whole plant genomes. Comparative analyses will reveal genomic architecture associated with shifts in photosynthetic metabolism and will uncover how early-diverging flowering plants reduced their genome size as compared to their gymnosperm relatives. Project outcomes will provide a direct test of genome-metabolic scaling as it applies to autotrophic metabolism and elucidate the evolutionary genetic mechanisms by which genomes expand and contract in response to selection on photosynthetic metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the importance of these insects as a study group, there is no comprehensive phylogeny depicting the evolutionary relationships among these insects. By using anatomical information gathered from fossil and living dragonflies and damselflies in combination with DNA data gathered by harnessing the power of next generation sequencing technologies, this research will produce the first comprehensive phylogeny for this group.

There is a pressing need in ecology and conservation biology to better understand the underlying processes leading to species extinction with the goal of developing predictive models for local, regional, and ultimately global extinctions. Although general threats to biodiversity are well-documented, there is less consensus about why one species may go extinct while others persist in response to one particular disturbance or threat. This suggests that the key question to understanding modern biodiversity loss is not what causes extinctions, but why do some species go extinct, while others survive? This study examines the loss of species from aquatic and terrestrial environments due to a variety of disturbances. These disturbances will include the loss of habitat area, and the introduction of predators and novel species. Mathematical models will be developed to predict and test for different outcomes. Of key interest is determining the degree to which the loss of species is due to chance events alone and the degree to which the characteristics of species that make some more susceptible to being lost than others. This work will engage undergraduate students in the development, design and implementation of each stage of the project. This research training of undergraduates in experimental design and theory and the use of modeling approaches will prepare the next generation of scientists to address pressing environmental issues. <br/><br/>Empirical data and perspectives provide conflicting evidence as to whether species extirpations and extinctions are best explained by random chance or by selective trait-based processes. This proposal uses artificial aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm environments to test a framework for clarifying when probability alone or ecological determinism, acting through species identity and traits, predict and explain patterns of local and regional extinctions. Through a combination of manipulative experiments, modeling and null analyses, this study will 1) test the prediction that local extinctions caused by habitat loss will be explained by species rarity alone; 2) determine whether delayed extinctions (extinction debt) after habitat loss are the function of random chance or selective, deterministic processes; and 3) test whether ostensibly selective disturbances, such as predator addition and habitat homogenization, may overwhelm the importance of random chance and rarity in explaining patterns of local and regional extinction. Understanding how and why species go extinct will allow for the prediction and prevention of extinctions, which is essential for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity."

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which microbes convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere to a form that can be used by the plant to make proteins, DNA, and other compounds crucial for life. This process is well-documented for legumes, i.e. plants that house nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, but it can also occur for grasses where a wide range of bacteria appear to fix nitrogen by a process known as associative nitrogen fixation. Many details of associative nitrogen fixation remain unknown, including its ecosystem importance, the microbial taxa that fix the nitrogen, and the ecological relationships driving its occurrence. Associative nitrogen fixation has potential significance for many ecosystems, and in agriculture it may help to meet the fertilizer requirements of perennial grasses grown for forage and bioenergy. If perennial grasses could get most of their nitrogen from biological fixation, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, which reduces both costs to farmers and the negative environmental consequences associated with synthetic fertilizer use. The goals of this research are to determine when and how much associative nitrogen fixation occurs in perennial grasses, identify the microbial taxa fixing nitrogen, and explore the relationship between the plant and nitrogen-fixing microbes.  The project will also provide research experiences and develop teaching materials for K-12 teachers and students. <br/><br/>The research will use stable isotope tracers to trace the nitrogen in switchgrass, a well-studied perennial grass native to North American prairies. They will trace labeled dinitrogen gas into switchgrass tissues and surrounding soils, as well as into the DNA of the nitrogen-fixing microbial taxa. Carbon will be traced from photosynthesis through the plant and into microbes, which will show whether the nitrogen-fixing microbes are receiving carbon from the plant or from the soil. Finally, the active nitrogen-fixing microbes will be sequenced, with the resultant genomic data providing insights into the functions of the plant microbiome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A robust set of theories and models of cities as social-ecological systems is necessary to help cities adapt to changing conditions, and improve environmental quality both within cities themselves, and in the hinterlands that lie within their ecological footprints.  In addition, knowledge of the drivers of ongoing changes within existing cities and suburbs are important for environmental sustainability, economic vitality, and human well-being. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) is a Long-Term Ecological Research project that is committed to understanding metropolitan Baltimore, MD, as an ecological system, and to sharing crucial ecological knowledge with communities, educators, and decision makers in the city and surrounding regions. A long-term approach to understanding urban systems is required because 1) many ecological processes that occur in cities, such as changes in plant communities, animal diversity, and soil development, are slow, 2) many of the intense and even catastrophic events that change city form and function occur only infrequently, and 3) the feedbacks between ecological processes and human actions unfold over long-time periods. BES has discovered clear baselines and has documented trajectories of environmental change over nearly two decades of concentrated research. These ongoing studies have documented surprising results about the functioning of urban systems, tested or modified existing ecological models, and generated new ways to understand the city as an ecosystem. Many of these insights have been incorporated into curricula and educational materials for K-12 and post-secondary education. The new urban models and perspectives developed in BES have proven to be important for understanding cities and regions well beyond Baltimore.<br/><br/>The fundamental challenge and mission of BES is to understand and discover how biological, physical, and human factors interact to change urban ecosystems over long time scales. The project addresses three questions that reflect the complex nature of urban ecosystems: 1) How do hydrology, ecosystem nutrient transformations, and social factors affect transport and retention of nutrients and contaminants by urban watersheds; 2) How do species composition and structure of biological communities respond to a complex set of biophysical and social processes; and 3) How do human choices about land management interact with watershed dynamics and the structure of biological communities? These questions emerge from fundamental theories of the drivers of nutrient retention in ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem function, metacommunity dynamics and human decision-making. The BES research team will continue to collect key long-term data on stream and watershed function, the biodiversity of plants, animals, and microbes, and human resource use and social structure. We will develop and implement new spatially extensive field sampling to improve knowledge about 1) the spatial linkages between streams and their watersheds, 2) the role of human management on diversity in plant and insect communities, and 3) the impact of both market and non-market land use decisions on ecosystem processes. Our overall approach is to co-locate research across all disciplines on three watersheds to facilitate the level of social-ecological integration necessary to achieve deep understanding of urban ecosystem structure and function."

Biologists have long tried to explain why this form of reproduction is so widespread across nature despite substantial costs. One possibility is that mixing up genomes through recombination allows natural selection to act more efficiently. Yet, asexual reproduction should be more efficient: it avoids the costs of finding partners and mating, and allows individuals to pass all (rather than half) of their genetic material to their offspring. This research will test this hypothesis by comparing adaptation in sexual versus asexual yeast populations. In addition to these scientific goals, this work will involve the development and dissemination of curriculum integrating mathematics and biology education. <br/><br/>Much recent theoretical attention has focused on the potential for recombination to speed adaptation by bringing together beneficial mutations that occur in different genetic backgrounds, alleviating competition and interference between them. Similarly, recombination can purge deleterious mutations from advantageous genetic backgrounds. However, experimental evidence for these effects is scarce. A few laboratory microbial evolution experiments have shown that recombination can indeed increase the rate of mean fitness increase in adapting populations, but until recently it has been impossible to directly observe the effects of recombination at the genotypic level. This research will quantify how recombination alters the sequence-level dynamics of adaptation in experimental populations of budding yeast, by combining a novel genetic system with high-throughput sequencing methods to characterize how recombination alters the dynamics and outcomes of genomic sequence evolution in laboratory budding yeast populations. This work will then track the long-term fate of sexual reproduction in direct competition with asexuals, to determine how and why sexual reproduction is favored or lost in adapting populations. This project will produce extensive data describing the rate, predictability, and genetic basis of adaptation in laboratory populations that will contribute to the advancement of the field."

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function. Training of undergraduate students is a key component of the project and undergraduates will be involved with all aspects of the research. A cross-institutional research experiment will be developed for them, where they can work together to study the impacts of species range shifts from North Carolina to Maine. One graduate student and a postdoctoral associate will also be trained. Finally, the team will continue public outreach at each home institution, as well as at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado where most of the research will be conducted. <br/><br/>This project will test how range shifts along environmental gradients in the dominant group of detritivores (caddisfly larvae) will affect multiple ecosystem processes, including the transfer of detrital energy to detritivore secondary production, release of detritus-bound nutrients for algal uptake, bottom-up effects of algae on herbivores, and ecosystem metabolism. Researchers will use models, experiments, and comparative data from whole ponds to investigate the degree to which 1) species replacements along permanence and elevational gradients are functional replacements in terms of detritus processing rates and cascading effects on brown (detrital) and green (algal) trophic paths, 2) the interactive effects of species shifts across the permanence gradient within an elevation and those associated with range shifts across elevations, and 3) how changes in ecosystem processes with community rearrangements scale up to natural ponds. Impacts will be assessed on three components: 1) the amounts of nutrients and energy from dead plant parts that are eaten by animals (detritivory), 2) how much of the consumption is released back into the environment and stimulates the growth of algae, which can then also be eaten, and 3) how new combinations of species affect the overall productivity of the ponds."

Phylogenetically useful off-target sequences, (e.g., complete chloroplast genomes) are also obtained. By sampling 20 individuals per species, the approach will distinguish common causes of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. An analytic workflow will be applied that incorporates simulation of incomplete lineage sorting and a combination of species tree inference methods that are effective even when introgression has occurred.

However, the rate of CO2 rise is much slower than emissions suggest it should be. It appears that the land surface and oceans are together absorbing about 50% of annual CO2 emissions. A plausible explanation is that the land uptake is occurring because higher levels of CO2 increase plant photosynthesis, meaning more plants have carbon available to support growth. However, a competing explanation proposes that tree growth is not limited by the rate of photosynthesis itself, but is instead controlled by other factors such as rates of cell division, nutrients, or water supply. The extent to which trees are carbon-limited, and under which circumstances, is fundamental to understanding how they will respond to rising levels of atmospheric CO2. This project will improve our understanding of this timely issue. Each week during the growing season, the researchers will quantify rates of wood growth and cellular development at the microscopic level. Samples will be collected from the dominant tree species at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. This will be done for three years, to examine how year-to-year variation in weather influences the timing and amount of wood growth, and how this differs among species. The researchers will also conduct a novel experiment to manipulate the flow of carbon within the tree, and thus investigate the relationships between local carbon supply and wood growth. This project will thus directly address the question of whether or not tree growth is carbon-limited. The research has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the role of vegetation in the global carbon cycle, the impacts of environmental change on plants, and our interpretations of past climates as recorded in tree growth rings.

The researchers will tease apart the controls on wood growth at the whole-tree scale for the first time through careful measurements of the internal dynamics of carbon within mature trees of three widely-distributed temperate species (i.e. white pine, red oak, and red maple) growing in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. In an observational study, the researchers will measure non-structural carbon storage dynamics and details of wood growth at the cellular level. In an experimental study, the researchers will manipulate the transport of new photosynthetic products to growing regions using cold-block phloem chilling collars, and will thus be able to draw novel inferences concerning key relationships between wood growth and carbon supply. Subsequently, a model developed using the collected data and derived knowledge will be used to examine the implications of these results for the historical and future terrestrial carbon sink."

It will integrate advanced tools from analytical chemistry, molecular genetics, and behavioral ecology to collect unprecedented data on diet, fruit volatile molecules, bat olfactory genes and behavioral preferences for two ecologically important groups of tropical plants and animals (Piper plants and Carollia bats). This work will test whether mutualism has imposed selective pressures on plant and frugivore traits, or if their diversity is best explained by phylogeny. Novel comparative and experimental approaches will link the patterns of diversity in: (1) mutualism strength, (2) fruit scent chemical composition, (3) bat olfactory receptor subgenomes, and (4) bat scent preferences. By relating plant chemical signals to the olfactory subgenome and behavioral responses of frugivores, this research will jumpstart the integration of genomic and behavioral applications in evolutionary ecology, and enable future research on the functional chemical ecology of complex systems."

Some trait variation can be easily mapped to particular genes due to clear associations with variation in encoded proteins. Much trait variation, however, is difficult to characterize with precision because it is caused by differences in DNA sequences that control gene expression. Variation in these so-called regulatory elements has traditionally been much more difficult to characterize than variation in protein-coding regions for technical reasons. The purpose of this project is to develop new methods and computational resources to allow biologists to identify regulatory elements that control quantitative variation in natural and emerging model systems. The development of these methods will transform the manner in which biologists link phenotype with genotype and thus how they study the functional basis of evolutionary change. The methods will be broadly used and likely impact fields as disparate as agriculture and bioengineering. <br/><br/>Nucleotide polymorphism association studies, sometimes coupled with transcript abundance data, have become a favorite approach for identifying genomic loci underlying trait variation. This commonly adopted approach, however, often fails to characterize specific causal genomic elements. Instead, it often settles for neutral markers indicative of selection across regions spanning tens to hundreds of thousands of nucleotides. In some cases this may be sufficient to identify causal genes, especially when association intervals contain obvious changes in protein coding regions. In many cases, however, it is difficult to improve resolution because important functional changes in regulatory elements are difficult to identify. For this project the investigators are working to develop a novel, high-resolution approach to precisely map cis-regulatory quantitative trait loci (creQTLs). Specifically, they aim to characterize creQTLs by combining standard genotyping analysis with assays for chromatin structure and active transcription. This approach would allow association studies to consider both regulatory activity and nucleotide sequences, and could lead to resolution of <150bp for QTLs mapping to regulatory elements. The overarching goal of this project is to optimize this approach for use in emerging model systems and to develop bioinformatic tools for annotation and statistical inference of creQTLs, with an emphasis on utilizing readily available draft-quality genomes."

Complementary broad sequencing of pine genomes will also provide useful data in which to advance genomics of pines both within and outside of this project. Additional research products will include the generation of least five more genomes for Suillus (only two are currently available) and transcriptomes for multiple members of Suillus and the pines from EMF-colonized roots. Collectively, these molecular resources would be relevant across multiple disciplines: metabolic and signaling networks that participate in co-evolution and host specificity as well as fungal-host recognition, communication, and nutrient acquisition and exchanges.

From these data they will develop, test, and validate new models of how Chagas disease transmission. Once validated, these models can then be extended to predict transmission of the many other vector-borne diseases that affect human beings wherever they are found and that cumulatively produce about 1.4 million deaths annually.<br/><br/>Findings from this research will be shared with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health and the Pan American Health Organization to inform their ongoing efforts to stem the tide of Chagas disease in Latin America.

As they grow, tropical plants take up large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, and store a substantial proportion of that carbon in their biomass and ultimately in soil. In addition, there is some evidence that plant growth will accelerate in the future with rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, taking up and storing more carbon. However, it is unclear whether other plant nutrients are sufficiently plentiful in tropical forest soils to allow plants to grow as much as is predicted. In the tropics, soil phosphorus (P) concentrations are generally very low and such low P concentrations could strongly limit plant growth in the future. This research will explore how plants acquire phosphorus from soil, and which forms of phosphorus are actually accessible to plants. Experiments will explore how plant roots, bacteria and fungi ""mine"" nutrients from the soil, and will identify the specific microorganisms capable of accessing soil P. This work will be among the first to explore relationships between tree growth and different forms of soil P, it will improve understanding of the controls on biological P availability, and it will shed light on how pervasive P limitation is to plant growth in tropical soils. In addition, the project will enhance our ability to predict future rates of tropical forest productivity and could lead to improvements in how soil fertility is managed in tropical agricultural soils. Finally, the research will involve student training as well as promoting interaction between scientists and environmental journalists.<br/><br/>Knowledge of the true extent of nutrient limitation of plant primary production in the tropics remains incomplete, in large part reflecting our poor understanding of what forms of soil P are actually available to biological organisms. The proposed research will address the following overarching question: Are forms of soil phosphorus (P) that have traditionally been considered biologically unavailable actually available to plants and microorganisms? In the highly-weathered soils that dominate the lowland tropics, only a small fraction of total soil P resides in forms that are traditionally considered biologically available; the vast majority resides in more chemically and/or physically protected P pools that are presumed to be unavailable to plants and soil microbes. However, if plants and soil microbes can effectively overcome low soil P availability by accessing these recalcitrant forms of P that, until now, have been thought to be unavailable, then the extent of P limitation in the tropics could be less than current biogeochemical theory predicts. The proposed research includes a set of field, laboratory and greenhouse experiments conducted in a set of tropical forest sites in Panama. Together, the planned experiments have been designed to test the working hypothesis that P forms that have traditionally been viewed as unavailable are actually biologically available. Building on the experimental data, the research will culminate in a set of synthesis and modeling activities designed to explore how variations in soil P availability may affect future rates of NPP at ecosystem to global scales."

This research will identify how genetic variation in host defenses is maintained and thus how hosts evolve to reduce the effects of parasites. The research uses two species of fruit flies, Drosophila species, and their mite parasites as a model. The research outcomes will inform the development of improved pest control strategies in agricultural settings, and new methods to control disease vectors that are of significance to human health and wellbeing. Research outcomes will be integrated into educational outreach programs involving high school students and the general public. <br/><br/>A major hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variation in defensive traits, and hence for the enormous evolutionary potential of parasitism, involves costs of resistance. Costs are expressed as trade-offs between host resistance and other fitness-related traits, such as reproductive output, in the absence of parasites. There are few data available for animal host-parasite systems on the genetic and physiological bases of costs of resistance, despite their widespread importance. The researchers will bridge studies of host molecular, metabolomic, and physiological processes, with whole-organism fitness functions, to understand the mechanistic bases of costs of parasite resistance. Using two naturally occurring host-parasite systems, three interrelated aims will be achieved. 1) Test for trade-offs between evolved ectoparasite resistance and major life-history traits in D. melanogaster. 2) Determine and compare the causal molecular and metabolomic factors of ectoparasite resistance and of trade-offs in the two systems. 3) Identify the physiological and anatomical mechanisms underlying fitness costs. The results will be unique to animals, and will complement studies in plant and microbial systems. The research will thus contribute to the development of a unified theory of resistance evolution."

This high diversity has important implications for sustainable agriculture and for the conservation of biodiversity because genetic diversity allows crops and wild plants and animals to persist in the face of disease and other environmental challenges.  Understanding genetic diversity is also important in medicine because individuals have different susceptibility to disease and they can respond differently to the same treatment; this is the foundation of the recent emphasis on ""personalized medicine"".  However, high genetic diversity is surprising because we expect that local populations that share a common gene pool and experience similar environments should be relatively genetically homogenous. This project addresses the debate about why individuals within populations (including humans) are so genetically diverse.  Specifically, the research team will test a prominent hypothesis: that high diversity is maintained because rare gene variants confer an advantage to individuals who bear them (i.e., they are favored by natural selection).  The project will also identify the genes that are the direct targets of this kind of selection.  Because experiments required to answer these questions would be impossible in humans or agricultural species, the project will use a vertebrate animal that has well-known natural history, ecology, and behavior, and for which the genome sequence has recently become available (the Trinidad guppy).  These small fish have high genetic diversity for body color, and this research will examine competing ideas about why: (1) fish with rare patterns survive better, or (2) fish with rare patterns reproduce more successfully.  This project will also produce educational material and activities for school children.  This material will enhance students' understanding of genetics, ecology, and evolutionary biology by using an animal with which many students are already familiar since guppies are popular in home aquariums.<br/><br/>Accounting for the persistence of high genetic diversity in ecologically-important traits is a fundamental problem in population genetics, and one that has fundamental implications for agriculture, medicine, and conservation biology.  Debate about what processes maintain variation has led to the development of important population-genetic principles and hypotheses, but the larger question remains unanswered.  This project will test the hypothesis that selection that varies in space or time (""balancing selection"") maintains genetic diversity in natural populations and will link these selective processes directly to the genetic variants they target. Researchers will combine genomic and ecological approaches in a species exhibiting one of the best-known cases of adaptive polymorphism, the colour patterns in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Field and laboratory studies of predator density, reproductive behavior, and color-pattern variation will determine which ecological processes promote genetic variation. Whole-genome sequencing of guppies from 13 natural populations will identify regions of the genome enriched for intermediate-frequency alleles; using data from many populations will allow us to differentiate between loci under balancing selection and those that are polymorphic because of non-selective processes such as random genetic drift and migration. This multipronged approach will enable linking evolutionary processes that maintain variation directly to the genetic variants (polymorphisms) they target."

By identifying those incompatible regions in species of mice, this research will reveal genetic mechanisms responsible for speciation (and biodiversity). Another novel contribution of this research will be the development of new approaches that analyze entire genomes, instead of one region at a time. The project will combine research with teacher training to share discoveries with the public. In addition to expanding evolutionary knowledge, this research will benefit applied fields, including human health. For example, the framework developed in this project can be used to understand the current reproductive effects of historical mating between humans and Neanderthals.<br/><br/>This research will provide new theoretical and empirical frameworks for measuring gene flow between species in hybrid zones. The focus will be ancestry junctions - those points along chromosomes where ancestry switches from one species to the other. In contrast to existing analyses of hybrid genomes, this approach will easily scale to entire genomes. Computer simulations will be used to quantify the effects of selection, migration and genetic drift on ancestry junctions across the genome. A range of genetic architectures of reproductive isolation will be investigated to determine the conditions under which selection against hybrids leaves detectable genomic signatures.

In the following mass extinction event, non-avian dinosaurs, which had been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, did not survive. One surviving group was the mammals; yet, they did more than just survive, they in turn became the dominant vertebrates in most ecosystems. However, the scientific community still does not understand how mammals flourished in the post-extinction world. Numerous mammalian fossils from the first few million years after the extinction event have been discovered, including the first large mammalian herbivores. However, it is unclear how these unusual fossils relate to mammals alive today - are they direct ancestors or merely distant cousins? This project will focus on this neglected fossil record from the first 12 million years after the asteroid impact, a time characterized by high global temperatures and brief episodes of rapid global warming. By understanding what these extinct mammals were, this project will explore the true role of this extinction event in the evolution of mammals, examining which kinds of mammals survived, and how and why they recovered and evolved in a very rapidly changing climate. Today, Earth is experiencing a modern-day extinction event, as environmental change and human actions are threatening many species. Although the current circumstances differ from those 66 million years ago, understanding the underlying biological processes acting in a post-extinction world will guide us in the future.<br/><br/>Controversy surrounds the origin of placental mammals and the role of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event on their evolution, with evidence from morphology on the one hand and DNA on the other at odds. DNA-based studies argue for a Cretaceous placental origin, with the K-Pg event having little impact, whereas morphology-based studies argue for a Paleogene origin driven by the K-Pg event. Previous phylogenetic analyses of placentals have sampled heavily from older (Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene, 56 to 34 million years ago or earlier) taxa, but the sizable mammalian diversity from the Paleocene (66 to 54 million years ago) has been largely ignored. This project will correct this shortcoming by including most Paleocene lineages in a comprehensive phylogeny designed to directly address the controversy regarding the impact of the K-Pg event. Over 1,500 morphological characters, including some studied with computer tomography (CT), from 262 extinct and extant taxa will be combined with over 35,000 base pairs from 26 nuclear genes from extant mammals, and analyzed together using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methodology. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees will be used to resolve the origin of Placentalia and diversification of major subclades using divergence time analyses, and to estimate body size and morphological character evolution rates using model-based techniques.

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease.  Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies.

In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions.

The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence.

A genetic duplication can occur when an offspring inherits two copies of a DNA sequence from a parent who only has one copy; these duplicated regions in the genome are called repeats. Following duplication events, these repeats can subsequently diverge due to mutations that affect one repeat but not others. However, this divergence can be partially or completely counteracted by a phenomenon known as interlocus gene conversion (IGC). IGC increases the similarity of repeated sequences by copying sequence stretches from one repeat copy into the corresponding region of another. The role of IGC mutations in shaping how repeated genomic regions evolve through time is poorly understood. This project aims to develop statistical methods for quantifying and incorporating the impact that IGC has in shaping genomes. By doing so, this research will illuminate the forces that shape repeated regions in genomes and will assist in understanding the biological function of these regions. Project goals will be accomplished with the assistance of undergraduate researchers. These students will have the opportunity to visit collaborators at the University of Tokyo in a cross-cultural exchange. In addition, visualizations will be created to simultaneously teach the general public about statistical inference and the forces that shape genomes.<br/><br/>A variety of likelihood-based statistical tools for studying IGC will be developed and assessed.

The research will investigate whether there are tendencies of some repeat copies to be donors and other repeat copies to be recipients during IGC events. Careful consideration will be made of how to accommodate IGC in detection of positive diversifying selection, divergence time estimation, and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The work will combine theoretical development, software implementation, and testing using a combination of simulation and empirical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Outreach to the public and K-12 students will occur as part of this project, and undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be involved in the research. <br/><br/>The strength and direction of natural selection on phenotypic variation is not equal among all individuals within a population. In particular, genetic correlations between the sexes can produce intralocus sexual conflicts when selection acts antagonistically between males and females. Recent work has shed light on the evolutionary constraint that sexually antagonistic selection can produce, but its role in the general process of adaptation remains unclear. Theory suggests that intralocus sexual conflict will be minimal in a population adapting to a novel environment and will emerge only when populations approach their adaptive peaks. This research will address the role of intralocus sexual conflict on the adaptive process by answering these questions: (1) Does sexually antagonistic selection and the resulting sexual conflict influence the adaptive process from the start or does it have more of an influence later when trait values approach their optimum? (2) Does the antagonistic relationship between the sexes change over time allowing for or limiting the evolution of sexual dimorphism? This project integrates the experimental study of evolution with the statistical tools of a large-scale mark-recapture project and next-generation sequencing. Genetic and phenotypic samples are available for nearly every guppy within these experimental populations dating to the start of the experiment. These data provide the opportunity to estimate fitness, mate choice, trait heritability, and the genetic covariance between the sexes. Using this system and these methods, the researchers will answer questions on the genetics of adaptation in a manner not previously possible.<br/>"

Many rare or endangered species have experienced sharp population declines known as population ""bottlenecks"".  These bottlenecks can have deleterious genetic impacts similar to inbreeding and affect the probability of species recovery. Understanding and quantifying these effects in populations allows for more effective management and better prediction of survival outcomes. A model example of a species that has experienced population bottlenecks is the sea otter. It was hunted almost to extinction, with numerical declines of >99% during the course of the 18th -19th century fur trade. The small number of surviving otters increased over the 20th century under careful monitoring and enhanced protection. In this project, the researchers will endeavor to determine whether the fur trade decline had lasting impacts on the sea otter genome that can be observed in extant populations. The researchers will compare genomes of sea otters that lived before the fur trade to those living today across the entire geographic range. Native American rubbish deposits, known as middens, dating back to Pre-Columbian times will supply the prehistoric and historical samples.  The researchers will use cutting-edge gene sequencing technology to identify deleterious genes and predict their effect on individuals and populations. The results will inform future management plans for these populations and provide a new precedent for research on rare and endangered species. Researchers also will work with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute to create exhibits demonstrating how genome sequencing can aid conservation efforts and provide new genomic insights into a charismatic species that has an essential role in maintaining coastal kelp forest ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project will utilize low and high coverage genome sequencing of individuals from six modern and three ancient pre-bottlenecked sea otter populations to reconstruct demographic history and quantify patterns of deleterious variation as a proxy for genetic load. A novel analytical framework will be developed using genetic variation data across multiple time points to study the relationship between small population size and patterns of deleterious mutations. Using forward-in-time simulations, null expectations of how genetic drift should act on different genomic elements will be developed for comparison to the empirical genomic dataset, and the importance of natural selection in preserving and purging deleterious variation will be quantified. The roles of purifying, relaxed and balancing selection will be examined by testing for enrichment of deleterious variation across genic regions. This research will provide a framework for distinguishing between moderately and strongly deleterious mutations and for evaluating the effects of bottlenecks on natural selection at the molecular level that can be applicable to other systems. As a result of this research, a variety of recent demographic events in a species with a complex demographic history will be detected and quantified, patterns of deleterious mutations across multiple time points will be compared, and patterns of genetic load will be predicted. Finally, the ways in which purifying and balancing selection are affected by small population sizes will be evaluated. The replication of recent extreme demographic events across sea otter populations and the abundance of pre-fur trade otter samples in Pre-Columbian middens provide unprecedented opportunities to isolate the effects of a bottleneck on deleterious variation and genetic load. The results and methods developed in this study will be broadly applicable to understanding the biology of small populations, especially those that are endangered."

Shallow coastal bays are found along much of the east coast, and are particularly vulnerable to the effects of excess nitrogen, which can lead to algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, and loss of high-habitat quality seagrasses.  This research will examine the recovery of a shallow bay as nitrogen inputs are greatly reduced without any concomitant change in inputs of other nutrients and pollutants, making it perhaps the first such study in the US.  The site, West Falmouth Harbor on Cape Cod (MA), has received high levels of nitrogen inputs for the past 15 years, due to contamination of incoming groundwater by a sewage treatment plant, causing poor water quality and habitat degradation.  The nitrogen contamination has now been cleaned up, and so nitrogen inputs entering the harbor will be 3-fold less than in the past.  To date, relatively few coastal bays have recovered from excessive nitrogen inputs, so this study will provide information on the rate of recovery and extent of restoration of habitat quality that is critical to better manage and protect these valuable coastal resources.   <br/><br/>While most coastal scientists believe nitrogen is the primary cause of coastal eutrophication, this remains debated.  This study will provide important insights as to not only whether nitrogen is the controlling nutrient, but if so, why.  One hypothesis is that a large net import of phosphorus from deeper coastal water helps maintain N limitation. If so, net phosphorus import should decline as primary production (and resultant demand for phosphorus) declines.  The research will also explore the relationship of carbon storage to net ecosystem production, testing the hypothesis that lower nitrogen inputs will shift the ecosystem towards greater heterotrophy. Will the harbor continue to store carbon, by importing more carbon than the net amount respired?  These questions will be addressed by measuring rates of primary production and ecosystem respiration from diel changes in dissolved oxygen and pH, seagrass extent and biomass elemental composition, and by measuring the exchanges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon between the harbor and the deeper adjacent coastal waters of Buzzards Bay, MA.  Results will be compared with 12 years of data taken during the high nitrogen loading period, and will thus provide a strong picture of the recovery trajectory of the system."

This research will contribute to the development of new methods for more accurately determining evolutionary relationships when many species have been formed in rapid succession.  The results will have implications for better understanding the coevolution between milkweeds and monarch butterflies and the evolution of plant defense, as well as provide a robust evolutionary context for understanding the results of other scientific studies exploring aspects of plant reproduction, genome evolution, and other areas using milkweeds.

The work combines methods for targeted sequencing of hundreds of specific regions of the nuclear genome applied to unusually large within-species sampling.  The project applies nuclear gene probes developed directly from Asclepias genome and transcriptome sequences to effectively target 768 genes and substantial amounts of their non-coding flanking regions.  Phylogenetically useful off-target sequences, (e.g., complete chloroplast genomes) are also obtained. By sampling 20 individuals per species, the approach will distinguish common causes of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. An analytic workflow will be applied that incorporates simulation of incomplete lineage sorting and a combination of species tree inference methods that are effective even when introgression has occurred. Because current species tree approaches are constrained by a computational tradeoff between the number of loci and number of alleles that can simultaneously analyzed, the project will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods.  The large sample of loci will also validate the recognition of species not currently accepted in Asclepias. Undergraduate and graduate student training in genomics, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics will target participants from underrepresented groups.

How the eye functions depends on the ecological and the biological characteristics of the organism, such as whether particular species are nocturnal, live underground, or metamorphose, e.g., the transition from a tadpole to adult frog. This project uses frogs as a model group of species to investigate the evolution of vision, by integrating information on the morphology, genetics, and physiology of these organisms. Results from the project will provide insight into the role that vision systems play in the evolution of novel, adaptive solutions to new environmental challenges, a topic of primary importance in understanding causes of species diversification throughout the tree of life. To achieve these goals, this project relies on international collaboration to sample frogs from across the globe. Undergraduate researchers will receive research training and aid in producing the scientific results. This project will leverage the outreach of two major public museums to disseminate the new discoveries to the general public via exhibits and educational e-books.<br/><br/>This project integrates morphological, molecular, and spectral data to investigate the evolution of vision systems in frogs at both ancient and recent timescales. Molecular evolutionary studies will provide a genomic perspective on vision evolution with the expectation that visually-oriented frogs exhibit greater levels of natural selection, gene duplication, and retention of vision genes. Characterizing the physiology and molecular underpinnings of vision in species with aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults will reveal how the visual system adapts to distinct visual environments during metamorphosis. These broad studies will provide a framework for more focused investigations that target transitions in natural history characteristics. Using the hyperdiverse African reed frogs, this project will test whether the evolution of bright coloration is associated with visual system diversity that maximizes species recognition. Finally, this project will investigate how transitions to life below ground have shaped the morphological and genetic components of visual systems with the expectation that eye reduction accompanies a reduction in use or inactivation of vision genes. This project takes an integrative approach that will provide detailed and comprehensive insight into vision evolution across life history transitions to address a central gap in our overall understanding of vertebrate vision evolution."

By addressing each of these objectives in a group of closely related species at varying stages of divergence, this research will involve the most detailed analyses of species and speciation ever conducted in a reptile. The results of this work will provide new insights that are central to understanding species and to effective conservation management of biological diversity.

Second, landscape genetic analyses will be used to test the contribution of biogeographic and ecological processes to species divergence. Third, multi-generational experimental crosses will test if intrinsic reproductive isolation evolves relatively early in the speciation process, and in accordance with general rules. Finally, fourth, using mapped genomic sequence data from individuals sampled in nature and individuals with known pedigrees, this work will test if initial divergence between species results largely from natural selection acting on a limited number of loci or genomic regions. This work will investigate each of these topics in a highly variable species complex that includes populations at various stages of the speciation process.

As these types of disturbances become more frequent, the interactions between them can greatly amplify the impacts on forest health and sustainability. This project will study an unprecedented, ongoing forest mortality event that affects oak-dominated forests in southern New England. Tree mortaility appears to be related to the interaction of both drought and multiple canopy defoliations by non-native Gypsy Moth caterpillars. This project will evaluate how the timing and interactions of those disturbances matters in forest health. The research will assess if areas that have greater tree mortality are those that experienced the most intense initial drought or if they underwent defoliation closer in time to the drought. The results of the project will be very valuable to forest stakeholders, helping them understand the underlying causes of the tree mortality event and potentially allowing prediction of future impacts. The investigators are highly engaged with the regional forest management community and the results of the project will be used in planning forest management strategies including tree removals related to this mortality event. The project is important as it will communicate the potential ramifications for wood products markets, forestry and arboriculture practices, and general forest use by the public. <br/><br/>Interactions between climate-mediated disturbances, such as droughts, and biotic disturbances, such as defoliating insect pests, are increasingly driving continental-scale forest structure and function. However, the temporal lags associated with drought effects on biotic disturbance are not well understood and empirical data to address this topic are lacking. The central hypothesis of this project is that the effect of interacting drought and defoliation disturbance will be mediated by temporal proximity between disturbances and initial drought severity. The project will combine high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing analysis with dendrochronological reconstruction of forest growth patterns to assess how the timing and severity of interacting disturbances affects patterns of disturbance resistance, forest productivity, and tree mortality in temperate forest ecosystems. The study will be conducted in a network of forest stands, identified through the remote sensing analysis, which will be replicated across categories of defoliation timing in relation to the initial drought disturbance. The results of the project will support hypothesis generation, model parameterization, and general conceptual frameworks for future experimental and modeling studies that can evaluate the mechanistic basis for, and consequences of, disturbance interactions in terrestrial ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The small, isolated patches of prairie that remain harbor great biodiversity, yet rates of local plant extinctions are alarmingly high in remnant prairies. This project will advance scientific understanding of why some populations go extinct and others persist. Threats to prairie populations include fire suppression, declines of pollinators, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and a reduced capacity to evolve by natural selection. This project builds on a long-term investigation of these ecological and genetic processes and feedbacks between them affecting a model prairie plant species. The purple coneflower typifies prairie plants in its long lifespan, often decades, and in other attributes. This study is the first of its kind to illustrate a population's capacity to adapt. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge and disseminating information to scientists and land stewards, this project will provide research experience and training to diverse participants at a level appropriate for their interests and career stage: high school, college, and graduate students, teachers, and citizen scientists in Minnesota and at the Chicago Botanic Garden.<br/><br/>The project uses formal quantitative genetic approaches and common garden experimental designs to quantify additive genetic variance for fitness, population differentiation, and inbreeding depression. Researchers will estimate the amount of genetic variation in Darwinian fitness of individuals planted in 2003, many of which flowered for the first time in 2015 using aster statistical models to analyze fitness data. Other experiments will estimate the reduction in mean fitness due to mating between siblings. Together with demographic censuses of remnant populations, started in 1996, these studies will yield comprehensive assessments of population growth rates and the potential for evolutionary rescue. A key strength of the research is that experiments are conducted in a realistic habitat, including interactions of the coneflower with its pollinators and herbivores. The core datasets comprise continuous individual fitness records, including annual survival and reproduction of over 17,000 plants in ten experiments and in 27 natural prairie remnants in Minnesota. These datasets, which will extend up to 30 years by the end of the project, offer a rare window into the interplay of evolutionary and ecological processes of a long-lived species."

Genes involved in adaptation or isolation between species are frequently located in regions of a chromosome where the ancestral gene order has flipped. These inverted chromosome regions block gene exchange between closely related species, which allows the genes inside them to evolve independently. It is not known whether those key genes are randomly spread inside the inversions or whether they are more likely found close to the edges or the center of those inverted regions. Circumventing the barriers to genetic analyses posed by inversions will allow researchers to learn the genetic basis of species divergence and adaptation. This project will use the Drosophila (fruit fly) genome editing toolkit to reverse the outcome of the evolutionary process and flip back the large chromosomal inversions that separate Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. This will allow unprecedented analyses of important species divergence traits linked to these inversions. This research will also have educational impacts in K-12 education and teacher training via collaboration with public school teachers from local minority high schools. Moreover, chromosome inversions cause many important human diseases. Understanding where the critical sequences lie is fundamental to development of treatment of those diseases. <br/><br/>An important mechanism that allows species to persist in the face of gene flow is the presence of chromosomal inversions. Although considered impermeable barriers to gene flux in heterozygotes, chromosomal inversions can exchange genetic material via double-crossovers or non-crossover gene conversion. Those processes should be more common in the central regions of inversions. Theoretical studies thus predict that nucleotide divergence between species differing by inversions should be higher at the breakpoint regions relative to the center, and that adaptive or reproductive isolation genes should also be more likely located towards the breakpoints. Tests of the first prediction have been conducted using population genetic or comparative genomic data, resulting in a range of inconsistent patterns suggesting that theoretical models may oversimplify the expected effects of inversions on recombination. Test of the second prediction, on the other hand, have been impossible to conduct because inversions reduce or impede recombination in hybrids, precluding fine scale genetic analysis of interspecific differences at those genomic regions. To overcome this limitation, this project will leverage CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to revert two fixed inversions between the sibling fruit fly species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The strains that will be generated will be used for genetic mapping of reproductive isolation factors (hybrid male sterility), and for an experimental evolution study that will test whether and how much chromosomal inversions facilitate the persistence of hybridizing species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores whether protective pigmentation in flowers has increased in response to increasing amounts of UV light.  Because flower color is important for attracting pollinators, understanding how it may have changed is necessary to understand how effectiveness of pollination may also have changed.

Because UV-B has increased most in polar and temperate regions during the last century, they predict that species with polar and temperate distributions will display larger increases in UV-absorbing pigmentation than sub-tropical species. Additionally, the researchers will test the prediction that species with pollen-bearing structures exposed to sunlight will respond to changes in UV-B, while those with pollen structures recessed within the flower (protected) will not. Researchers will use herbarium specimens and bioclimatic databases to gather data on flower pigmentation and abiotic conditions for 75 diverse taxa with different geographic distributions.

Many large mammals succumbed to the harsh climatic conditions of this period, while others were confined to habitable ice-free areas, or refugia. During the peak of the last Ice Age, sheets of ice divided the Old and New Worlds, restricting movement of organisms across the Bering Land Bridge for thousands of years. Geological and biological evidence have suggested, however, that refugia along the North Pacific Coast may have played crucial roles as ""stepping stones"" for movements of species between the Old and New Worlds, forming an early postglacial corridor for the recolonization of North America. Building on an unparalleled vertebrate bone collection excavated from limestone caves in Southeast (SE) Alaska, this project will perform genetic analyses and radiocarbon dating of black and brown bear specimens from throughout the last 50,000 years to directly test if these caves were occupied by bears at the peak of the last Ice Age. By ensuring precise species determinations of these keystone mammal species in SE Alaska, and providing evolutionary links to extant populations, this research will elucidate species' responses to climate change and help circumscribe the extent and timing of viable coastal refugia in SE Alaska.

Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is universally accepted. In contrast, sympatric speciation, the divergence of species in the absence of geographical isolation, is controversial. The current debate focuses on the relative contribution of sympatric speciation to the origin of biodiversity in general and on the underlying genetic mechanisms. Sympatric speciation has been repeatedly suggested to play a role in the origin of social parasitism, but this has not been comprehensively tested. Fungal farming ants are an ideal model system to study this process. The ant social parasites to be studied lack a worker caste and do not contribute to colony maintenance tasks. Instead they are specialized on using the host colony's resources to maximize their own reproduction. Social parasitism appears to be a highly successful life-history strategy, given that social parasites have evolved more than 100 times independently and convergently in ants. Thus, these ants represent a unique series of natural experiments that allow for testing speciation patterns, for studying the genetic conditions underlying speciation processes in a comparative context, and for testing specific hypotheses regarding the evolution, ecology, and behavior of social parasitism. To take full advantage of this study system, the evolutionary history that shaped the rich mosaic of host-parasite interactions will be reconstructed and species boundaries in the leaf-cutting ants will be clearly delimited. On a practical level, this will enable the better identification of these commonly encountered and economically highly important ant species, which is important to agricultural researchers and pest management. Additionally, this project has real ramifications for the improvement of human agriculture and disease management through the study of an analogous natural system. This project will train high school students, undergraduates, graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. In the course of the project a public outreach experience featuring this research on leaf-cutting ants and fungus-farming ants in general will be designed and implemented at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for a national and international audience.<br/><br/>This project will employ an integrative phylogenomic, population genetic, behavioral, and taxonomic approach to achieve the following research goals: (i) Phylogenomic markers, so-called ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), will be employed to infer a comprehensive, fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny for the fungus-farming ants. The phylogeny will be used to test whether the six social parasite species evolved independently, whether parasites are the closest relatives of their hosts, and whether so-called ""incipient"" parasites evolved more recently than morphologically derived parasites. (ii) In addition to the ants, we will reconstruct the phylogeny of the symbiotic fungi cultivated by the leaf-cutting ants and their close relatives that together comprise so-called ""higher ant agriculture"" utilizing UCE phylogenomic markers that the researchers have recently developed for the fungal order Agaricales. Rare shifts to new fungal cultivars can be associated with ant speciation, and therefore the possible role of fungal association in the ant speciation process will be tested. (iii) An integrative approach, incorporating phylogenomic, population genetic, and morphological data, will be utilized to taxonomically revise and reclassify the leaf-cutting ant genera Atta and Acromyrmex, including the satellite parasite genus Pseudoatta. A process of reciprocal illumination will be applied to clearly delineate species boundaries and recognize cryptic species. A clear understanding of species boundaries in leaf-cutting ants, some of which are serious agricultural pests in Latin America, will allow for unambiguous species identification and inform targeted pest management strategies."

We know that new traits can arise from mutations and other types of changes to existing genes and chromosomes. However, prokaryotes, such as bacteria, are also able to acquire completely new genetic information and traits from other bacteria or from their environment through a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). These horizontally transferred genes can allow bacteria to rapidly adapt to new environments. Until recently, it was thought that HGT happened only in bacteria. However, multiple apparent cases of HGT have been documented in a wide range of organisms, including the fungi, plants, and animals. The goal of this project is to identify, validate, and characterize HGTs in multiple blood-feeding and plant-eating arthropod species, including two species of ecologically and economically important mites. Results will expand our understanding of how widespread HGT is in eukaryotes and how it has contributed to their evolution, diversification, and ability to take advantage of new environments. The research will take place at Spelman College, an historically black all-women's college. Female minority undergraduate students will collaborate on the project and receive hands-on research training. A teaching and research post-doctoral fellow will also be trained. Outreach includes the development of educational materials for middle and high school students, and a half-day teacher training event. <br/><br/>This project seeks to determine whether HGTs played a role in the acquisition of convergent phenotypic traits necessary for the invasion of novel niches by divergent arthropod species. The researchers will validate, characterize, and curate previously identified HGTs in arthropods and determine the prevalence and extent of shared HGTs, using a standardized methodology. The researchers hypothesize that HGT has repeatedly allowed for the independent acquisition of similar novel phenotypic traits in multiple distantly related arthropod species, and has allowed for niche invasion and novel resource exploitation in these species. A combination of bioinformatic, transcriptomic, and genomic approaches will be used to identify and validate HGTs across 15 arthropod species. Resulting data will be used to test the prediction that HGTs are shared by multiple niche-sharing species, either blood-feeders or herbivores, while being absent from more closely related, but non-niche sharing species."

This project will characterize these changes, at the molecular level, within and among closely-related species of fruit fly to understand their evolutionary history, the cause of specific changes, and the effects for sperm survival and fertilization success. This project will also result in the development of a ""Genes, Genomes, and Society"" (GGS) educational program to introduce high-school students to the field of genomics.

Proteomic analyses will be similarly conducted on female reproductive tract secretions. The resulting datasets will provide, for closely related species, an exhaustive library of the sperm proteome throughout the life history of sperm, which will permit all alterations to sperm (protein gain, loss and modification) to be discerned.  With regard to proteins added to sperm during storage, reciprocal sex-specific labeling will distinguish male- from female-contributed proteins. Molecular evolutionary and genomic analyses of proteins involved in sperm-female interactions, together with the data from hybrid inseminations, will address questions about rates of divergence, genetic architecture and the putative role of sperm-female interactions in speciation."

In the wild plants exist in multispecies groups and often share pollinators which can lead to exchange of pollen between different species. This research will determine the mechanisms that allow different species of flowering plants to coexist when utilizing the same pollinators, that is, how they avoid or tolerate exchanging pollen. Thus, the work will advance understanding of the consequences of plant interactions via their shared pollinators and will provide data for predicting the composition and sustainability of natural flowering plant communities, as well as the consequences of disruption of these from global change, such as climate warming, invasive species, or pollinator decline. Identifying the traits that allow combinations of flowering plants to coexist will benefit society by informing agricultural practices for enhanced sustainability, and policies for conservation of biodiversity hotspots. The work will also provide training in pollination biology for elementary school students and high school teachers via workshops and hands-on activities that are designed and implemented by graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The question of how plant-pollinator interactions contribute to flowering plant communities has largely focused on plant traits that mediate pre-pollination interactions, and ignored the potential for traits that mediate post-pollination processes. This work will test the novel assertion that plant traits (e.g., style and stigma features) which influence the female fitness costs of pollinator sharing (detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen receipt) play an important, yet underappreciated, role in mediating coexistence of flowering plants within communities. Using replicated California wildflower communities as a model, the work will link plant traits with the pattern and costs of heterospecific pollen receipt, and modifiers of pre-pollination interactions at a community-wide scale. In doing so, the work will test the idea that within a co-flowering community tolerance and avoidance of heterospecific pollen receipt are alternate strategies for coexistence, and that tolerance is a stabilizing force that depresses the risks of reproductive failure of species that receive high heterospecifc pollen.  Thus, the work will accelerate our understanding of the primary ways pollinators contribute to the coexistence flowering plants, an area urgently in need of greater study, especially in the face of global changes affecting both plants and pollinators."

In the following mass extinction event, non-avian dinosaurs, which had been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, did not survive. One surviving group was the mammals; yet, they did more than just survive, they in turn became the dominant vertebrates in most ecosystems. However, the scientific community still does not understand how mammals flourished in the post-extinction world. Numerous mammalian fossils from the first few million years after the extinction event have been discovered, including the first large mammalian herbivores. However, it is unclear how these unusual fossils relate to mammals alive today - are they direct ancestors or merely distant cousins? This project will focus on this neglected fossil record from the first 12 million years after the asteroid impact, a time characterized by high global temperatures and brief episodes of rapid global warming. By understanding what these extinct mammals were, this project will explore the true role of this extinction event in the evolution of mammals, examining which kinds of mammals survived, and how and why they recovered and evolved in a very rapidly changing climate. Today, Earth is experiencing a modern-day extinction event, as environmental change and human actions are threatening many species. Although the current circumstances differ from those 66 million years ago, understanding the underlying biological processes acting in a post-extinction world will guide us in the future.<br/><br/>Controversy surrounds the origin of placental mammals and the role of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event on their evolution, with evidence from morphology on the one hand and DNA on the other at odds. DNA-based studies argue for a Cretaceous placental origin, with the K-Pg event having little impact, whereas morphology-based studies argue for a Paleogene origin driven by the K-Pg event. Previous phylogenetic analyses of placentals have sampled heavily from older (Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene, 56 to 34 million years ago or earlier) taxa, but the sizable mammalian diversity from the Paleocene (66 to 54 million years ago) has been largely ignored. This project will correct this shortcoming by including most Paleocene lineages in a comprehensive phylogeny designed to directly address the controversy regarding the impact of the K-Pg event. Over 1,500 morphological characters, including some studied with computer tomography (CT), from 262 extinct and extant taxa will be combined with over 35,000 base pairs from 26 nuclear genes from extant mammals, and analyzed together using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methodology. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees will be used to resolve the origin of Placentalia and diversification of major subclades using divergence time analyses, and to estimate body size and morphological character evolution rates using model-based techniques. The evolutionary and diversity rates will be compared to paleoecological data to assess the impact of early Paleogene climate variation on mammalian history."

One explanation for this pattern is that new forms can arise by changes in gene regulation, that is, shifts in when and where those genes are active.  Although regulatory differences are known to underlie changes in features as complex as eyes and wings, it remains unclear how broadly this regulatory hypothesis applies and whether, in some cases, changes in the genes themselves are more important. This project will address this question by tracing the evolutionary changes involved in flower color transitions across Petunieae, a group of 140 species that includes the ornamental petunias.  The genes that produce floral pigments are well studied, making it possible to characterize the genetic changes associated with flower color evolution even at this broad scale.  As a part of this work, the researchers will create and present color-themed activities to diverse groups of K-12 students and undergraduates in order to enhance teaching and learning about the connections between genes, pathways, and phenotypes across the tree of life.<br/><br/>This project will test the role of regulatory evolution in the color diversification of Petunieae through three specific aims. The first aim will infer the history of flower color shifts in the clade using a new phylogeny constructed from transcriptomic data. Building on this phylogenetic framework, the second aim will use comparative methods and biochemical profiling to quantify the evolutionary relationship between changes in the expression of pigment pathway genes and color variation. Given the modular nature of the regulation of these genes, the third aim will test for correlated evolution of gene expression across the phylogeny. These aims will be carried out through collaborations with botanists from Brazil and Argentina, who will participate in research exchanges to foster the sharing of knowledge and techniques. At a local scale, the research activities will be integrated into outreach events as well as inquiry-based course modules for undergraduates and upward-bound high school students.

This loss of biodiversity is likely reducing the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems. Some of these benefits are directly related to plants, including the production of livestock forage in grasslands and wood in forests. There has been some progress in understanding the consequences of biodiversity loss. But it remains challenging to quantify how species loss affects ecosystems over large areas. This study establishes new experiments to expand knowledge of plant productivity and biodiversity. The key advance of this project is to study the mechanisms linking productivity and biodiversity at different spatial scales. Data will be made publicly available through the Cedar Creek Long Term Ecological Research website. Results will be incorporated into Cedar Creek's K-12 education and community engagement programs. These programs serve more than 10,500 K-12 students and visitors each year. The study will also help understand how the diversity of teams can enhance learning and productivity.<br/><br/>This study will test predictions about ecosystem productivity. Productivity depends on local plant diversity and species interactions at small spatial scales. However, at larger scales, additional factors such as dispersal and species sorting are likely more important. At these larger scales, it is important to develop new techniques to measure biodiversity such as remote sensing using hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR. This study will investigate the landscape-scale dependence of productivity on biodiversity using three approaches. First, the impact of dispersal on biodiversity and productivity in grassland plant communities will be experimentally tested. Second, remote sensing techniques will be used to quantify how biodiversity effects on productivity change from local to landscape scales. Third, the role of dominant species will be experimentally tested across several habitat types, including grassland, savanna, deciduous forest, coniferous forest. The hypothesis will be tested that dominant plant species are optimally sorted across heterogeneous landscapes. This would create positive effects of landscape diversity on productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many lakes, however, are now experiencing increased input of carbon and nutrients, warming temperatures, and declining ice cover, which may reduce water quality or cause blooms of potentially harmful algae. Specifically, many lakes across the United States are experiencing increased browning due to high loading of organic matter leached from land plants. Browning reduces water clarity and interferes with drinking water management practices. In addition, it can cause other changes that may lead to rapid long-term declines in water quality. This research will test the hypothesis that browning may reduce oxygen concentrations in lakes. Low oxygen can cause nutrient release from lake sediments that may increase algae blooms, leading to lake eutrophication. Understanding the effects of browning will increase knowledge of lake ecosystems, and improve forecasts of how lakes will change as their surrounding environments change.  This research will also train graduate and undergraduate students, and will lead to better public understanding of threats to lake water quality.<br/><br/>Ecological tipping points are of vital interest as anthropogenic activities rapidly transform natural ecosystems. Changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM) represent one important potential driver of tipping points in aquatic ecosystems. This project will investigate whether increases in terrestrial DOM loading can push clear-water oligotrophic lakes beyond a critical tipping point by stimulating hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment DOM and phosphorus release, which may initiate a positive feedback loop of decreasing water clarity, stronger thermal stratification, and enhanced hypolimnetic anoxia. This feedback loop accelerates ecological change and ultimately may shift lake trophic status toward greener, mesotrophic to eutrophic as well as browner, dystrophic conditions. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s in two lakes in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Complementing these long-term observations, experiments and modeling will be carried out to understand feedbacks associated with browning and enhancing understanding of broader patterns of change in inland water bodies.

The small, isolated patches of prairie that remain harbor great biodiversity, yet rates of local plant extinctions are alarmingly high in remnant prairies. This project will advance scientific understanding of why some populations go extinct and others persist. Threats to prairie populations include fire suppression, declines of pollinators, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and a reduced capacity to evolve by natural selection. This project builds on a long-term investigation of these ecological and genetic processes and feedbacks between them affecting a model prairie plant species.

In addition to advancing scientific knowledge and disseminating information to scientists and land stewards, this project will provide research experience and training to diverse participants at a level appropriate for their interests and career stage: high school, college, and graduate students, teachers, and citizen scientists in Minnesota and at the Chicago Botanic Garden.<br/><br/>The project uses formal quantitative genetic approaches and common garden experimental designs to quantify additive genetic variance for fitness, population differentiation, and inbreeding depression. Researchers will estimate the amount of genetic variation in Darwinian fitness of individuals planted in 2003, many of which flowered for the first time in 2015 using aster statistical models to analyze fitness data. Other experiments will estimate the reduction in mean fitness due to mating between siblings. Together with demographic censuses of remnant populations, started in 1996, these studies will yield comprehensive assessments of population growth rates and the potential for evolutionary rescue. A key strength of the research is that experiments are conducted in a realistic habitat, including interactions of the coneflower with its pollinators and herbivores. The core datasets comprise continuous individual fitness records, including annual survival and reproduction of over 17,000 plants in ten experiments and in 27 natural prairie remnants in Minnesota.

The construction of budgets for whole forest watersheds, for example, has greatly increased our general understanding of how water, carbon, and other substances cycle through ecosystems more generally.  However, uncertainty due either to natural variation in observations or measurement error is rarely included in research reports. This makes it difficult to determine actual rates of change over time or to compare with confidence results from different sites or studies.  Failure to address uncertainties can lead to wrong conclusions, for example in identifying missing sources or sinks for nitrogen in a forest. Uncertainty analysis can also help improve the efficiency of environmental monitoring by allowing sampling designs to optimize information gained relative to the time and money required to collect and analyze the data. This network will organize working groups to address five topics. Expert statisticians will serve on an advisory board for these working groups and also consider cross-cutting issues, such as evaluating the possible approaches to quantifying uncertainties in making observations and building computer models, demonstrating how uncertainty analysis can be used to evaluate the efficiency of monitoring designs, and determining how changes in ecosystem measurements over time can best be detected.  <br/><br/>Building this network will require using several different approaches to coordination and communication, and for providing an effective structure for shared learning, including web meetings, conference calls, email, and annual face-to-face meetings.

This research addresses fundamental questions about how the environment, habitat, local life history, and local physiological traits interact to determine the geographic range of gypsy moths. Introduced from Europe to Massachusetts in 1869, gypsy moth now occurs over nearly a million square kilometers of eastern North America, extending from Minnesota to North Carolina. It is a highly damaging pest of hardwood forests, causing extensive economic and ecological damage to public and private property, as well as negatively impacting the forest products industry. In some parts of its range, gypsy moth is spreading rapidly across the landscape, while in other areas, the invasion front is static or retracting. So far, only one-third of susceptible forest types in the United States have been invaded, leaving large portions of the country still at risk. This project addresses how the invasive potential of a species can change along its leading edge and how a changing environment can determine whether ranges expand or contract. This research also includes training and outreach components that will reach a wide range of student learners, educators, and community stakeholders.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to use patterns of expansion, stasis, and contraction at gypsy moth range limits to examine how local changes in gypsy moth traits influence the potential for future spread. Specifically, the project tests for range-wide variation in tolerance to high and low temperature extremes, local adaptive changes in those physiological limits, and how these traits interact with temperature to influence invasive spread under predicted changes in regional environments. To determine how temperature extremes impact the survival and growth of populations from across the invasion front, experiments will be performed to quantify temperature-dependent growth rates, critical thermal limits, and temperature-specific metabolic rates. Additionally, the effects of current and future environmental conditions will be tested using growth chambers programed with region-specific current and future temperature regimes. The effects of current overwintering conditions at the range extremes on hatching success will be tested by deploying egg masses from a range of populations at both the northern and southern range edge. Publically available climate data, as well as the exhaustive sampling effort by state and federal agencies that annually measures the abundance of gypsy moth along the entire 2000 km range edge, will be used to examine future spread potential. These experimental approaches, combined with information on the current distribution and spread rate will lead to a greater understanding of traits underlying the success of invasive species and help to identify areas that may become more or less susceptible to invasions in the future."

Ants churn the soil, scavenge the dead, suppress (and sometimes propagate) pests, and are themselves some of our most pernicious pests. Ants are ectotherms (i.e., cold-blooded), which means that the health and activity of an ant colony depends in part on the weather. Climate, in turn, is weather observed over time, and abundance evidence shows that climate is changing. This research addresses a key task in ecology by exploring how changing climate across the U.S. will impact the health and activity of ants and, by extension, how shifts in ant species may impact the many species that ants influence. The research tackles a widespread problem: that to document ecological change one must first have detailed historical records of the way ecosystems once were. Such records are rare. This research fills that knowledge gap by revisiting 34 ant communities from across the United States that were first sampled approximately 20 years ago. At the time, those ant studies represented the best global snapshot of the abundance and diversity of this important insect group. This second, high-resolution snapshot will generate an unprecedented 34, 20-year trajectories of ant communities.  When matched to the latest climate trends and ecological theory, the work will paint one of the first pictures of how ecological communities are changing nation-wide. These data will allow ecologists to refine the predictions of how animals respond to climate change, and will jump-start such efforts by the nascent National Ecological Observatory Network.  <br/><br/>This research resamples 34 ant transects of 30 m2 plots from across North America that were originally sampled in 1994-95. The sites include or are matched to those of the nascent NEON network. The resulting 20-year trajectories of ant abundance and diversity will be used to tests three theories: Thermal Adaptation (the dominant model of thermal ecology which posits that thermal tolerance tracks climate means and variability); Biogeochemical Competence (a new hypothesis that links biogeochemistry to tissue concentrations of phosphorus (P), with P-rich tissue enhancing thermal tolerance); and Species Energy Theory (a dominant model of macroecology that builds mechanistic links between climate, abundance, and diversity). It tests these hypotheses at the population scale (i.e., do populations of species vary predictably in their thermal tolerance and dynamics?), across species (how does the mean species performance vary?), and summed across whole communities (what is the net change in the activity and abundance of ants in an ecosystem?). These samples will be calibrated with NEON by-catch of ground beetle pitfall traps to couple historical with future community trajectories."

Yet, the extent to which diversity at different levels of biological organization in host and microbiome communities influence functional diversity within ecosystems represents a considerable gap in our understanding of global biodiversity. This project will represent a landmark in understanding what generates and maintains biodiversity in river ecosystems. Freshwater mussels are a highly imperiled, species-rich group of animals that play critical roles in rivers through their filter-feeding and cycling of nutrients. Although the ecological value of freshwater mussels is widely appreciated, little is known about how factors like genetic diversity of individual species, species composition and diversity of mussel communities, or interactions between mussel communities and their gut microbiomes structure these ecological processes across environments and geographic scales. Similarly, little is known about how host-microbiome interactions have structured the evolution of both groups over time. If the processes and mechanisms underlying patterns of biodiversity in these animals can be identified, managers will be better armed to make informed decisions for conservation and restoration efforts that will ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem. <br/><br/>Using approaches that scale from individual-to-population-to-species levels and above, this project seeks to understand ecological and evolutionary associations among the environment, genetic diversity, functional traits, and community assembly across both host and microbiome phylogenies in contemporary taxa and ancestral lineages. This research will integrate analyses of (1) intraspecific genetic diversity in a suite of freshwater mussel species, (2) phylogenetic diversity of communities of mussel species as well as their associated microbiomes, and (3) functional diversity of the mussel-microbiome holobiont. Integrating these three dimensions of biodiversity will allow us to comprehend the mechanisms that underpin the roles that freshwater mussels play in ecosystems, and to understand the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that structure biodiversity in space and over time. Furthermore, this work will extensively populate public databases with new data on species distributions, abundances, microhabitat environmental characteristics, and DNA sequence variation that will have impacts on basic evolutionary and ecology research while also informing conservation and management of a highly imperiled and ecologically important group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although necessary for plant growth, carbon dioxide is also a greenhouse gas, so changes in activities of the Earth's tiniest life forms could have affects on a global scale. Warming temperatures, in turn, could affect microbial activities. If  warming increases microbial activities and carbon dioxide production, there could be a positive feedback that compounds the severity of environmental changes.  The goal of this project is to study the effects of temperature warming on natural communities of microorganisms in soil.  The research team will use cutting-edge experimental and computational tools to analyze the importance of microbial diversity. The project investigators have designed an experiment to test how well microbes from one climate do in another. For example, they will transplant microbes from a cool, wet mountaintop and measure how fast they can recycle dead plant matter in a desert. It's plausable that the mountaintop microbes will lack essential genes for survival in a desert - genes that desert microbes already have. To test this possibility, the investigators will use DNA sequencing to identify the genes present in nearly all of the microbes from each climate condition. The study will also test whether all microbes are equivalent and speed up their metabolism when the temperature rises.  The investigators will apply a sophisticated computer model to extend their experimental findings. The broad societal impacts of this project include training for a postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, new computational infrastructure, and an outreach-education program for visitors to a California state park. Student and postdoctoral training will focus on interdisciplinary research that links microbial diversity with environmental change. The investigators will make their computer models available on the Web so that they are easily accessible to the scientific community. This project will train a postdoctoral scientist and four graduate students, develop computational infrastructure, and establish an outreach-education program for visitors to a California state park. Training will focus on interdisciplinary research that links microbial ecology and genomics with ecosystem function. A specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based version of the microbial community model for dissemination to the scientific community. On the local scale, the PIs will partner with a University of California-Irvine outreach internship program and the non-profit Crystal Cove Alliance to develop an interactive research education station for visitors to Crystal Cove State Park, CA. Park visitors will have the opportunity to learn about the ecosystem process of litter decomposition and the consequences of microbial diversity in the context of climate change.<br/><br/>Conventional ecosystem models assume that biogeochemical rates are independent of microbial community composition, yet emerging empirical evidence contradicts this assumption. In light of this new evidence, the investigators hypothesize that litter decomposition rates and responses to climate change depend on microbial community composition. They will test this hypothesis by manipulating microbial community composition and transplanting communities across a climate gradient in southern California. The hypothesis would be supported if different communities transplanted into the same location decompose litter at different rates. Similarly, the response of litter decomposition rate to climate variation across the gradient should vary for different microbial communities.  This project will also analyze the microbial traits underlying differences (or similarities) in microbial community function. The investigators hypothesize that variation in decomposition rates across different microbial communities will be driven by extracellular enzyme traits. Likewise, variation in the microbial community response to climate change should relate to differences in 'response traits' such as drought and temperature tolerance. These hypotheses will be tested by sequencing the metagenomes of litter microbial communities and extracting functional traits using bioinformatics analyses. The taxonomic composition of the microbial communities will be quantified with high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS markers for bacteria and fungi. Finally, the investigators aim to examine the consequences of their experimental results under future climate change predictions. Molecular and ecosystem data will be incorporated into a simulation model that accounts for microbial community composition. The transplant manipulation results will be compared to model simulations with and without diverse microbial communities to test the importance of composition for function. Following a model selection procedure, the investigators will simulate litter decomposition under climate change scenarios in southern California. These efforts will reveal the consequences of microbial community composition for ecosystem responses to future climate change."

A key goal of this project is to understand how and when the number, and activity of insects change as one moves from place to place across the U.S., and why those numbers fluctuate from year to year.  Such an understanding can help predict insect pest outbreaks, the spread of invasive species, and changes in an ecosystems ability to provide food and fiber and conserve soil nutrients. This project will use insect samples collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) at 47 locations spanning the U.S.'s major ecosystems to determine how abundance, activity, and diversity of soil insects vary across the U.S.  The project will use environmental barcoding (analyzing insect DNA from the samples' preservative) and image analysis techniques to  train computer algorithms to count and identify insects preserved in the samples. Together, these technologies will automate and streamline NEON's monitoring network, providing the first such nationwide dataset on abundance, activity, and diversity of the U.S.'s soil insects. In doing so they will serve a variety of stakeholders: ecologists testing and refining models that predict future insect communities; land managers who want to know the likelihood of a pest eruption; conservation biologists and urban planners hoping to anticipate spread of invasive ants and beetles.<br/> <br/>A key aim of this project is to quantify and predict how Earth's great abiotic drivers--temperature, precipitation, and biogeochemistry--govern how ecological communities of soil insects vary from place to place. Community data at continental extents vastly underrepresent the terrestrial arthropods in part due to the immense effort required to count, size, and identify taxa ranging from mites to ants to beetles to spiders. Yet the few existing arthropod datasets suggest that as one travels from deserts to rainforests, terrestrial arthropod communities vary by orders of magnitudes in abundance (the number of individuals), size (mass per individual), activity (the rate at which individuals do work on the system), and diversity (the number of species/forms). Combined, these four variables help predict how arthropods regulate ecosystem processes like decomposition, herbivory, and seed dispersal. This knowledge gap will be filled by the analysis of samples from the NEON pitfall network (arrays of traps, sunk in the soil, that capture and store biweekly samples of arthropods in ethanol). It will develop two complementary methods to do so. Environmental Bar Coding samples and identifies pitfall taxa from extracts of ethanol. Image Analysis uses machine learning to count, size, and classify arthropods in a sample. Pitfall samples containing key orders of Earth's arthropods will be analyzed from NEON's 47 sites, and Environmental Bar Coding and Image Analysis pipelines that count, size, and identify taxa from these samples will be developed, tested, honed, and validated, and then used to analyze two years of NEON samples."

This research addresses fundamental questions about how the environment, habitat, local life history, and local physiological traits interact to determine the geographic range of gypsy moths. Introduced from Europe to Massachusetts in 1869, gypsy moth now occurs over nearly a million square kilometers of eastern North America, extending from Minnesota to North Carolina. It is a highly damaging pest of hardwood forests, causing extensive economic and ecological damage to public and private property, as well as negatively impacting the forest products industry. In some parts of its range, gypsy moth is spreading rapidly across the landscape, while in other areas, the invasion front is static or retracting. So far, only one-third of susceptible forest types in the United States have been invaded, leaving large portions of the country still at risk. This project addresses how the invasive potential of a species can change along its leading edge and how a changing environment can determine whether ranges expand or contract. This research also includes training and outreach components that will reach a wide range of student learners, educators, and community stakeholders.<br/> <br/>The objective of this project is to use patterns of expansion, stasis, and contraction at gypsy moth range limits to examine how local changes in gypsy moth traits influence the potential for future spread. Specifically, the project tests for range-wide variation in tolerance to high and low temperature extremes, local adaptive changes in those physiological limits, and how these traits interact with temperature to influence invasive spread under predicted changes in regional environments. To determine how temperature extremes impact the survival and growth of populations from across the invasion front, experiments will be performed to quantify temperature-dependent growth rates, critical thermal limits, and temperature-specific metabolic rates. Additionally, the effects of current and future environmental conditions will be tested using growth chambers programed with region-specific current and future temperature regimes. The effects of current overwintering conditions at the range extremes on hatching success will be tested by deploying egg masses from a range of populations at both the northern and southern range edge.

However, very little is known about how these ecological and environmental factors interact to explain fish body shape over evolutionary time-scales.

Indeed, in some places, plants and animals are the most important factors controlling variation in topography and thus patterns of habitats and hydrology on the land surface.  This work explores the role of biology in shaping the land surface in Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY), a complex and beautiful mosaic of cypress wetlands, pine uplands and deep water sloughs in southwest Florida.  BICY is a karst landscape, where limestone bedrock is present at the land surface.  While the landscape is almost perfectly flat, small wetland depressions carved into the limestone rock are crucially important for storing water and thus providing habitat for a wide array of plants and animals.  The origin of these wetland depressions is unknown.  This research will determine if these depressions, and their remarkably regular spacing on the landscape, are created by biological processes that naturally occur in wetlands that accelerate the rate at which limestone dissolves.  This creates the tantalizing possibility that the organisms populating these wetlands are slowly creating their own habitat by initiating and expanding topographic depressions.  The research team consists of scientists across a variety of disciplines, including hydrologists, geologists, biologists and modelers, creating the type of collaborative integration required to answer these types of research questions. Combining satellite and airborne data with detailed field measurements will allow the team to address how and how fast these depressions form, what that means for regional water flow and water quality, and how the topography and resulting patterns of habitats on the land surface were created.<br/><br/>This work contributes to an understanding of how ecological and geological processes work together to shape the land surface.  The central idea that patterns on the earth's surface arise spontaneously from interactions between plants and animals, on one hand, and rocks and water on the other, is a reminder of the strong and sometimes surprising links that exist in ecosystems.  In this case, wetland ecosystems are thought to change the shape of the land over thousands of years by dissolving rock.  This type of insight will contribute to understanding the origins of this landscape, which supports a remarkable array of organisms and habitats.  It will also improve understanding of hydrologic characteristics, and the impact of water movements on the greater South Florida system, including important elements of the Everglades.  Moreover, this work will help predict how ecosystem and biological processes may change as this very low altitude landscape is altered by sea-level rise.  Finally, the impacts of this work extend beyond south Florida because the project will contribute to an understanding of how karst landscapes form (20% of the earth's land surface) and how small geographically-isolated wetlands interact with their surroundings, a topic relevant to federal wetland protections.

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function.

Researchers will use models, experiments, and comparative data from whole ponds to investigate the degree to which 1) species replacements along permanence and elevational gradients are functional replacements in terms of detritus processing rates and cascading effects on brown (detrital) and green (algal) trophic paths, 2) the interactive effects of species shifts across the permanence gradient within an elevation and those associated with range shifts across elevations, and 3) how changes in ecosystem processes with community rearrangements scale up to natural ponds. Impacts will be assessed on three components: 1) the amounts of nutrients and energy from dead plant parts that are eaten by animals (detritivory), 2) how much of the consumption is released back into the environment and stimulates the growth of algae, which can then also be eaten, and 3) how new combinations of species affect the overall productivity of the ponds."

This project is designed to improve the ability of ecologists to predict the impact of significant tree die-off in semi-arid, forested ecosystems. The study focuses on pion-juniper woodlands. In the Southwest U.S., where they occur, higher temperatures and decreased precipitation have increased drought severity, reducing tree health, and triggering widespread tree death across the region. This research is motivated by previous findings showing that pion pine mortality unexpectedly leads to woodlands becoming hotter and drier, potentially altering the environmental conditions that control future plant growth and ecosystem recovery. These surprising results challenge the expectation that tree mortality would lead to increased soil water availability. This work will contribute key data on the specific roles of woody plants in regulating water availability in water-limited, semi-arid ecosystems following mortality of large numbers of trees. The modeling will clarify the extent to which specific forests are vulnerable to drought and changing climate, and will help to identify key environmental factors that increase vulnerability. One postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and several undergraduate researchers will receive training and support at two Hispanic-American Serving Institutions. This study will inform regional natural resource managers of climate effects and develop activities for students from Albuquerque-area and San Marcos, TX schools through STEM focused K-12 education programs at both institutions. <br/><br/>The project will test the overarching hypothesis that tree density in semi-arid biomes may represent a tipping point, such that a decrease in tree density due to drought-induced mortality can trigger a potentially irreversible drying of the system, and transition to a new ecosystem state.  The project will address: 1) specific mechanisms that explain why plant-available soil moisture and remaining juniper and small pion pine tree function decreases following pion mortality (decrease of hydraulic redistribution, altered energy balance, or reduced infiltration due to hydrophobic litter inputs); and which process, if any, is dominant; 2) if there are specific tree density thresholds or species-specific community compositions that facilitate aridification following tree mortality; 3) if there are soil structure and/or precipitation regimes in semi-arid woodlands that facilitate aridification following tree mortality and 4) what is the likelihood that these disturbed woodlands will return to their previous state or progress to a new ecosystem state. The experimental design is centered on nine large plots, three with no disturbance that will act as controls, three in which all pion pines are girdled, and three in which all juniper are girdled, which will allow the research team to examine species-specific roles of pion and juniper in regulating the hydrology of these woodlands. Measurements include the response of hydraulic redistribution and sapflow in the remaining species, soil moisture profiles, and surface energy balance components, which will be used to constrain a land surface model, the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5), modified to include hydraulic redistribution. The proposed work will greatly enhance the ability to predict how and why coniferous mortality in semi-arid biomes may trigger aridification, advance our understanding of the links between tree mortality and hydrology in semi-arid systems, and quantify the role of hydraulic distribution at the ecosystem scale."

They are classic study organisms for ecology and behavior. Along with frogs and other salamanders worldwide, they are also disappearing at an alarming rate, possibly due to factors such as habitat loss, infectious diseases, and other environmental stresses. Despite their visibility and imperilment, we know little about their genetic diversity and evolutionary history. While there are only 21 currently named species, recent work using DNA sequencing has revealed at least 45 potential species, which would more than double the size of the group. This research will reveal the true diversity of the group, providing a future platform for ecological and evolutionary studies of Desmognathus, and guiding conservation-management decisions for this imperiled group of aquatic vertebrates. Broader impacts will include a K-12 teaching module for understanding forest ecology, centered on salamanders, and updated species accounts for local wildlife-management authorities. This will be invaluable for understanding the biodiversity heritage of the United States.<br/><br/>With an exhaustive ""ecodrainage"" sampling technique, this research will analyze >7,000 samples from nearly every known Desmognathus population. The study will use next-generation genomic sequencing of DNA to understand the true genetic diversity of the group. These data will allow researchers to understand the evolutionary history of divergence, hybridization, and species boundaries from a genetic perspective, using modern species-delimitation methods. Many species are also difficult to distinguish by eye. Thus, this research will complement the genetic perspective with 3-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of size and shape, to reveal the subtle but significant morphological differences between populations. Overall, this research will generate a robust and fully-sampled estimate of the true number of Desmognathus species, their morphological variation for identifying them in the field, and their geographic range. This research will likely yield an increased number of Desmognathus species, while also showing a complex history of introgression, hybridization, and incomplete ecological speciation in the group."

Animal pollinators are critical to the reproduction and survival of most flowering plants, including many of our agricultural crops. Conventional wisdom holds that animal pollinators also have a primary role in driving the diversification of these species. However, this idea has rarely been tested in detail and at scale. Researchers will test this hypothesis using Burmeistera, a flowering plant genus whose 116 species depend on nectar-feeding bats for pollination. Burmeistera species place their pollen on different parts of the bats' heads, which may reduce the exchange of pollen and genes between species. They also have different degrees of genetic incompatibility with each other. These genetic barriers may reduce the fertilization success of cross-species pollinations or the survival of hybrid offspring. Researchers will evaluate which of these reproductive barriers contributes to each stage of the speciation process in Burmeistera. Undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, will be involved in all aspects of the project and will be trained in field and laboratory techniques. The project will also support the professional development of a post-doctoral researcher. Researchers will communicate results to the public via educational displays at the Missouri Botanical Garden and bilingual field guides for Burmeistera species.<br/><br/>This project will discover how reproductive barriers evolve during angiosperm speciation using an integrated experimental and comparative approach. Researchers will construct a robust species-level phylogeny for Burmeistera (Campanulaceae, the bell-flower family) using DNA sequence data from whole plastomes and over 700 nuclear loci. They will then measure pre- and post-pollination reproductive barriers among pairs of species having different phylogenetic distances. Assessment will include cross-pollination trials by captive nectar-feeding bats as well as hand-crosses of species in cultivation. Researchers will compare these measures within the context of the phylogeny to test the hypothesis that post-pollination reproductive barriers evolve before others. They will also determine whether changes in the length of pollen-bearing and receiving organs of Burmeistera flowers are correlated with speciation events, which would be consistent with the hypothesis of pollinator-driven speciation. Project outcomes will include an exceptionally detailed exploration of angiosperm speciation processes, improved taxonomic circumscriptions within a poorly-studied Neotropical flowering plant group, and the creation of new genetic resources and herbarium collections.

However, organisms themselves can contribute to species coexistence through their own  processes of variable reproduction and dispersal, through interactions such as competition, and through ways that different organisms modify their environment locally and increase heterogeneity.  The balance of the roles of the external environment and the organisms themselves in determining coexistence and diversity of species is a largely open question in ecology.  This project will use a novel field experiment to examine this question for a grassland system in Kansas.  The experiment will manipulate environmental heterogeneity using soil mixtures and will introduce differences in the effects of organisms by planting different mixtures of species in different ways.  A computer simulation model will complement the experiment to explore the details of various processes.  This work will contribute to knowledge on the maintenance of species diversity in plant communities, which is valuable in managing natural and modified (in this case, rangeland) plant communities to maintain ecosystem services.

The exogenous spatial heterogeneity is taken here as the spatial heterogeneity in soils, and the endogenous heterogeneity is taken as the conditions created by spatial heterogeneity in response to dispersal limitation, demographic stochasticity, competitive interactions, and organism-environment feedbacks resulting in endogenous spatial structuring of populations and communities independent of underlying environment gradients.  A novel experiment will compare mixed and unmixed soils in a block design.  Seeds will be sown to vary species aggregation pattern and species pools (by functional and phylogenetic diversity).

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function. Training of undergraduate students is a key component of the project and undergraduates will be involved with all aspects of the research. A cross-institutional research experiment will be developed for them, where they can work together to study the impacts of species range shifts from North Carolina to Maine. One graduate student and a postdoctoral associate will also be trained. Finally, the team will continue public outreach at each home institution, as well as at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado where most of the research will be conducted. <br/><br/>This project will test how range shifts along environmental gradients in the dominant group of detritivores (caddisfly larvae) will affect multiple ecosystem processes, including the transfer of detrital energy to detritivore secondary production, release of detritus-bound nutrients for algal uptake, bottom-up effects of algae on herbivores, and ecosystem metabolism.

The researchers have developed a novel way to rapidly determine which microbes grow well under different environmental conditions by following the frequency of unique ""barcodes"" that have been genetically inserted into a panel of 96 natural isolates of bacteria that naturally grow on plant leaves.

Think of the narwhal's tooth, the anglerfish's lure, or the lightning beetle's glowing abdomen. Novelty underlies major transitions in the history of life, including moving from sea to land and the origins of unique mammalian traits such as fur and lactation. However, this process is challenging to study because novel transitions are not often observed at their earliest stages. Missing the early stages means missing out on the opportunity for experimental studies. This research will use a rapidly evolving group of fish to study novel transitions. Since these fish exhibit novel skeletal structures, prey capture behaviors, and ecological niches, they are well-suited for such studies. This project will produce fundamental knowledge of how genes control facial structures and behavior; this knowledge will be useful in understanding variation in all vertebrates, including humans. In addition, a public database for managing endangered species in captivity will be created. New, research-immersive courses will be developed. These courses will provide valuable training in statistical programming and data analysis for undergraduates.<br/><br/>This research spans genotype to ecosystem to address a fundamental question: how does novelty originate from the intersection of ecology, natural selection, performance, and genetics? Answering this question is key to understanding how microevolutionary processes promote macroevolutionary patterns of novelty across the tree of life. Conventional understanding suggests novelty arises from resource abundance in new environments. More recent laboratory studies suggest complex dynamics lead to the evolution of novelty. This project will help bridge the gap between these two fields. To do so, the research will experimentally investigate novel transitions to scale-eating and snail-eating. Both feeding modes originated from an ancestral diet of algae in Caribbean pupfishes. The researchers will employ: 1) field and laboratory experiments measuring selection on hybrid phenotypes across environments; 2) ecosystem-scale measurements of productivity; 3) functional studies of hybrid performance; and 4) quantitative genetic and genomic analyses of the genetic basis of adaptive traits and source of adaptive variation. Hybrid crosses among pupfish species will be reared in the lab. Their fitness will be measured within field enclosures in hypersaline lakes on San Salvador Island and neighboring Bahamian islands.

It's complicated because all species interact with a large number of other species. They eat or are eaten by those species, creating what are called ""food webs"".  Practically all studies of food webs ignore the simple fact that interactions among species are likely to change as individuals grow up. For example, a butterfly eats different things as a caterpillar than as an adult. Likewise, different animals are likely to eat it as a caterpillar than as an adult. Another problem with past studies is that food webs in one habitat are treated as totally separate from those a nearby habitat. The simple fact that animals often move between habitats is typically ignored. This project overcomes both of these problems with past studies. Researchers will test how fish in streams not only affect their prey under water but also how those prey affect animals above water. Students will help collect data, learning cutting-edge ecological techniques. All participants will share their knowledge about food webs with school children and the general public. Results from this project will be important for managing freshwater resources and preserving their benefits for all.  More generally, this project is in the national interest because humans rely on properly functioning food webs for recreation, food, and water quality.<br/><br/>Through field surveys and manipulative experiments, this project will examine stage-structured interactions between fish and their insect prey, and the consequences of those interactions for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. Aquatic insects develop as larvae on the bottom of streams and lakes. They then metamorphose and emerge as winged adults in the terrestrial ecosystem. After emerging from the water, aquatic insects become common prey for terrestrial predators. As a result, fish predation on aquatic insects can affect terrestrial food webs. However, prey life stages vary dramatically in ecological traits, which means they are differentially susceptible to predation by fishes. This combination of cross-ecosystem movement by prey and stage-structured predation means that the effects of fish predation can not only extend beyond ecosystems, but could even be stronger in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the aquatic ecosystem. Such effects of predators would not be predicted based on current species-centric food web approaches, making this a somewhat risky project with high potential for changing how food webs are viewed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Birds, for example, can move easily from one region to another, but the plants and insects they depend on for food cannot.  This project explores the possibility that birds may find suitable climatic conditions in a new area but be deterred from moving there because the plants and insects they typically feed on have not been able to move there.  Researchers in Maine will use DNA to measure the diets of birds in a broad area where one type of forest stops and another type begins. They will test two possible explanations for why some birds are expanding into one of the forest types where they did not occur previously, while others species appear stuck in one place and are experiencing declines.  The first explanation is that the type of food used by the birds is more available for the expanding species than for the declining species.  The second explanation is that there is a mismatch in timing between the when food becomes available and when the declining species start to breed.  Researchers will engage undergraduate students, citizen scientists, and public school children in the project; everyone will work together to collect data and to discover the links between birds, their food, and climate.<br/> <br/>The insects and spiders consumed by birds within the boreal-deciduous ecotone will be identified using metabarcoding of 16S mitochondrial and cytochrome oxidase I genes.  Three groups of insectivorous forest birds will be sampled:  ""leading edge"" species (those that are expanding from a southern/deciduous range), ""trailing edge"" species (those that are declining and typically occur in boreal forest), and habitat generalists (those that occur more broadly across the region or habitat types).  Food availability and use will be assessed relative to both time (phenology) and place (habitat).  Life history, range, and behavioral characteristics of prey items will be used to compare the diets of the three bird groups.  Measures of food use will also be compared to timing of breeding and regional long-term population trends from the Breeding Bird Survey to examine possible effects of food availability and use on demography."

In spite of their high biodiversity and value, coral reefs appear to be particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, a consequence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Many calcifying reef organisms have reduced growth rates and their reproduction is disrupted under these conditions. Likewise the accompanying higher average sea temperatures can lead to coral bleaching, directly killing corals or increasing disease outbreaks. Combined, these impacts may be too much for many coral species to cope with, leading to predictions of degradation and collapse of these incredible ecosystems over the next few decades. This study examines the eight dominant Hawaiian coral species that constitute >95% of the coral cover across the archipelago, yielding broad relevance for the data. Further, the corals include two species-complexes currently being considered for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The results will be used to develop adaptive management plans for preserving biodiversity in a World Heritage Site, the Papahanaumokukea Marine National Monument, which is renowned as one of the most pristine and highly protected coral reefs remaining on the planet. This project provides a critical link between short-term, single-species studies and coral reef community responses to global change relevant to other marine ecosystems across the globe. Training opportunities for a post doctoral scholar, graduate students, and undergraduate students are provided, along with opportunities for local K-12 students. Outreach includes broad communication of the findings through interactive K-12 education, interactions with the Waikiki Aquarium, a rush-hour talk radio show, direct engagement with local resource managers, and an international blog.<br/><br/>Different coral species, and even different individuals of the same species, are known to vary in their tolerances to lower pH and higher temperature. Thus, it is important to know if the environment is changing too quickly for corals and coral reefs to respond effectively, or could acclimatization or adaptation of corals play a significant role in the future of reefs? The role of chronically reduced seawater pH and elevated seawater temperature on corals and on the diverse coral reef communities that rely upon, and live within, them are examined. First, the capacity for corals to regulate pH at their site of calcification after acclimation to a range of seawater pH and temperature using confocal microscopy and pH-sensitive vital dyes will be assessed to understand the influence of previous history (acclimatization) and fixed, heritable differences (adaptation) on the capacity of an individual coral to tolerate changes in the environment. Second, the potential for corals to acclimatize to lower pH and higher temperature will be empirically estimated in a two year mesocosm experiment including all eight of the dominant Hawaiian coral species. The range of physical environments will be characterized and the patterns of population connectivity will be investigated for the focal coral species across sampling locations to assess the potential for local adaptation. Finally, because relatively little is known about the impacts of low pH and higher ocean temperature on reef organisms other than corals, yet these thousands of other species comprise the bulk of reef biodiversity and perform important ecological functions on coral reefs, a two-year mesocosm study will examine the effects of chronically reduced pH and elevated temperature on the biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function of biologically diverse coral reef communities."

These analyses will also permit understanding of interactions among dimensions, for example, whether all are positively correlated and predicted by the same sets of variables, or in what contexts other types of correlations exist. This project is designed to yield two major conceptual advances in ecology and evolutionary biology. First, it will reveal new, emergent properties of biodiversity gradients in symbiotic organisms. Second, deconstructing constraints on individual partners of the symbiosis and quantifying feedbacks between and among them will make possible a full analysis, including biotic constraints, of the factors that impact diversity and distribution of the symbiotic organism as a whole."

These storms are capable of catastrophic short-term ecological and socio-economic impacts on forest ecosystems due to branch breakage and toppling of trees under heavy ice loads.  Their legacy can also persist over the longer-term through changes in forest productivity and species composition; the virulence of forest pests and pathogens; and increased risk of fire due to greater fire fuel loads.  Despite their influential role in shaping forest ecosystems, knowledge of ice storms and their impacts remains limited.  The temporally and spatially unpredictable nature of ice storms has largely confined past investigations to case studies following major storms.  The severity of ice storms in the northeastern United States, Eastern Canada and elsewhere has heightened the need for greater clarity on the role of these storms in shaping future forests.  Scientists at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in NH will conduct a multi-faceted program of research that includes a novel ice storm manipulation experiment, long-term field data, and climate and ecosystem modeling.  This research will provide the scientific community, land managers and the concerned public greater insight on the impacts of these powerful, and extreme winter weather events on the ecosystem dynamics of northern hardwood forests.<br/><br/>This integrated program of research is built on a foundation of previous work at Hubbard Brook and the region, including a pilot ice storm experiment conducted in 2012; a significant body of research on the forest ecosystem response to the severe ""Ice Storm of 1998""; and a new set of historical climate reconstructions which allow for the quantification of the meteorological conditions that lead to ice storms. Specifically, the investigators will: (i) develop high-resolution global climate model simulations to evaluate the severity, frequency and extent of ice storms under future changing climate; (ii) evaluate short-term (2-3 year) ecosystem response to four different intensities and two frequencies of experimental ice events; (iii) evaluate longer-term (17+ years) response of forest vegetation to the 1998 storm; (iv) use results from the experiment and the long term observations to refine an established forest ecosystem biogeochemical model to simulate ice-storm disturbance; and (v) use the results from the high-resolution climate simulations to drive the improved biogeochemical model to project future ice storm impacts on ecosystem fluxes and pools of carbon and nitrogen in a northern hardwood forest.  This research will be integrated with broader impacts involving: (i) the use of sensor technology to engage STEM students with disabilities in the study; (ii) a dialog on the impacts of ice storms with local stakeholders; (iii) the production of a video on the making of an ice storm and relevance to extreme events and climate change; and (iv) undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral training."

They are classic study organisms for ecology and behavior. Along with frogs and other salamanders worldwide, they are also disappearing at an alarming rate, possibly due to factors such as habitat loss, infectious diseases, and other environmental stresses. Despite their visibility and imperilment, we know little about their genetic diversity and evolutionary history. While there are only 21 currently named species, recent work using DNA sequencing has revealed at least 45 potential species, which would more than double the size of the group. This research will reveal the true diversity of the group, providing a future platform for ecological and evolutionary studies of Desmognathus, and guiding conservation-management decisions for this imperiled group of aquatic vertebrates. Broader impacts will include a K-12 teaching module for understanding forest ecology, centered on salamanders, and updated species accounts for local wildlife-management authorities. This will be invaluable for understanding the biodiversity heritage of the United States.<br/><br/>With an exhaustive ""ecodrainage"" sampling technique, this research will analyze >7,000 samples from nearly every known Desmognathus population. The study will use next-generation genomic sequencing of DNA to understand the true genetic diversity of the group. These data will allow researchers to understand the evolutionary history of divergence, hybridization, and species boundaries from a genetic perspective, using modern species-delimitation methods. Many species are also difficult to distinguish by eye. Thus, this research will complement the genetic perspective with 3-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of size and shape, to reveal the subtle but significant morphological differences between populations. Overall, this research will generate a robust and fully-sampled estimate of the true number of Desmognathus species, their morphological variation for identifying them in the field, and their geographic range. This research will likely yield an increased number of Desmognathus species, while also showing a complex history of introgression, hybridization, and incomplete ecological speciation in the group."

In the following mass extinction event, non-avian dinosaurs, which had been the dominant terrestrial vertebrates, did not survive. One surviving group was the mammals; yet, they did more than just survive, they in turn became the dominant vertebrates in most ecosystems. However, the scientific community still does not understand how mammals flourished in the post-extinction world. Numerous mammalian fossils from the first few million years after the extinction event have been discovered, including the first large mammalian herbivores. However, it is unclear how these unusual fossils relate to mammals alive today - are they direct ancestors or merely distant cousins? This project will focus on this neglected fossil record from the first 12 million years after the asteroid impact, a time characterized by high global temperatures and brief episodes of rapid global warming. By understanding what these extinct mammals were, this project will explore the true role of this extinction event in the evolution of mammals, examining which kinds of mammals survived, and how and why they recovered and evolved in a very rapidly changing climate. Today, Earth is experiencing a modern-day extinction event, as environmental change and human actions are threatening many species. Although the current circumstances differ from those 66 million years ago, understanding the underlying biological processes acting in a post-extinction world will guide us in the future.<br/><br/>Controversy surrounds the origin of placental mammals and the role of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event on their evolution, with evidence from morphology on the one hand and DNA on the other at odds. DNA-based studies argue for a Cretaceous placental origin, with the K-Pg event having little impact, whereas morphology-based studies argue for a Paleogene origin driven by the K-Pg event. Previous phylogenetic analyses of placentals have sampled heavily from older (Cretaceous) and younger (Eocene, 56 to 34 million years ago or earlier) taxa, but the sizable mammalian diversity from the Paleocene (66 to 54 million years ago) has been largely ignored. This project will correct this shortcoming by including most Paleocene lineages in a comprehensive phylogeny designed to directly address the controversy regarding the impact of the K-Pg event. Over 1,500 morphological characters, including some studied with computer tomography (CT), from 262 extinct and extant taxa will be combined with over 35,000 base pairs from 26 nuclear genes from extant mammals, and analyzed together using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methodology. The reconstructed phylogenetic trees will be used to resolve the origin of Placentalia and diversification of major subclades using divergence time analyses, and to estimate body size and morphological character evolution rates using model-based techniques. The evolutionary and diversity rates will be compared to paleoecological data to assess the impact of early Paleogene climate variation on mammalian history."

A popular idea is that predators control disease outbreaks by killing infected prey which are weaker and thereby easier to capture. However, this proposal warns that predators may sometimes spread disease in host populations. The researchers will use organisms living in lakes to test five ways in which predators could spread disease. These ideas are that predators: (1) while eating prey, physically spread parasites into prey habitat; (2) can increase food supply for prey, and more food can cause higher parasite production within infected hosts; (3) can shift the composition of prey populations towards certain ages and sizes that get infected more easily; (4) can kill other species that control disease; and (5) can cause genetic changes to prey populations, making them more susceptible to disease organisms. The project will focus on water fleas (the hosts), a deadly fungal parasite, and an insect predator to test these possibilities. The research uses these organisms as a model system: outbreaks of this fungus can be sampled in lakes, created in experiments within lakes and in the lab, and can be understood using mathematical models. These new ideas, once tested thoroughly in the lab and verified in nature, will help managers make prudent decisions on how to control disease outbreaks in wild and domestic animal populations. The project will train many students, and focus on engaging those in underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This project integrates three approaches. First, it will invest in a survey of fungal epidemics in water flea hosts in 40 lakes. The data from this large survey will be used to generate complex statistical models that test the first four mechanisms (ideas) given above. Second, it uses controlled experiments. One experiment will test mechanisms (2)-(4) with factorial manipulation of predatory insects and ""competitor-diluters"" (other water flea species which eat parasite propagules). A second experiment will investigate details of mechanisms (1)-(3). A third experiment investigates a tradeoff among clonal genotypes of the host; genotypes which better escape predation are more vulnerable to parasites. The hypothesis is that predators will shift host populations, via rapid evolution, towards bigger epidemics via this tradeoff. Third, this project develops a new suite of parameterized, mathematical (dynamical) models, designed to evaluate each of the mechanisms separately and together."

When rare species are lost, communities exhibit decreased functionality and provide devalued services to humans, which is an environmental and a socioeconomic problem. Although biodiversity loss is global and affects all ecosystems, biodiversity in freshwaters is threatened by much higher extinction rates compared to terrestrial habitats. Therefore, a better understanding of the causes and extent of rarity in freshwaters is urgently needed. Species rarity can be assessed using the species abundance distribution (SAD), which is a measure of the relative abundances of common and rare species. Although the SAD has been investigated for more than 70 years, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that determine the patterns of abundance inequality. The study will address this knowledge gap by developing a novel framework which predicts the response of the SAD in freshwater habitats along environmental and spatial gradients. The study will also investigate how the SAD affects regional biodiversity. Finally, the study will inform decisions for watershed management and biodiversity preservation by elucidating the causes of rarity in species targeted for conservation. This project will also provide research training for one postdoctoral associated, one graduate student and several undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project formulates specific hypotheses, predicting the SAD variability in response to niche and dispersal-related mechanisms as a function of scale, body size, and connectivity. These hypotheses will be tested with global data on freshwater algae, invertebrates, and fish, collected from running and standing waters by US and foreign agencies. Then, it will be determined how, in turn, the SAD constrains the patterns of beta diversity, a key component of regional biodiversity, by employing null model approaches. The SAD of communities and species groups of conservational or environmental importance will be fit with appropriate models. The variability of the parameters of these models will be analyzed statistically along gradients of water chemistry, climate, land use, latitude, longitude, and altitude, and across scales, habitats, and organismal groups. Implementation of the proposed framework would lead to better integration of metacommunity ecology and conservation."

Sometimes those disagreements are because of different methods or slightly different questions being answered, but other times they're due to true differences between years, places or species being studied.  It is important that scientists be able to distinguish between these possibilities and confidently reach conclusions. For example, some studies suggest that growing different crops together results in higher overall yields for farmers, whereas other studies suggest that growing a single type of crop results in the highest yields.  Do these conflicting results reflect some randomness in nature, different methods used by scientists in the two types of studies, or some other reason?  A statistical approach called meta-analysis has been developed to solve this problem.  Meta-analysis has helped many disciplines because it allows scientists to combine results from many studies, taking into account how they differ and providing insights that would otherwise remain hidden.  This project will use advanced techniques to improve how meta-analyses are done.  Researchers will focus on using the technique in the field of ecology.  They will mentor students and a post-doctoral fellow in data collection and analysis.  The results will be useful for improving the nation's ability to bring together and accurately interpret the complicated results of ecological studies.   <br/><br/>To improve the application of meta-analysis in ecology, this project will: 1) systematically review recent ecological meta-analyses to describe how they are typically performed (i.e., the statistical model and the way the size of an effect is calculated) and the characteristics of the dataset (e.g., the number of studies, the sample sizes of each study, and the magnitude of among-study and within-study variation); 2) use simulations to evaluate the performance of existing meta-analysis models and proposed alternatives (e.g., differing in weighting schemes, using Bayesian vs. frequentist approaches, or using different adjustments for non-independence), under a range of conditions likely to be encountered in ecological datasets (e.g., using sample sizes and the magnitudes of different sources of variation observed in ecology).

The majority of infectious diseases emerging in humans originate from animal hosts.  There are now thousands of scientific studies investigating animal-borne (zoonotic) disease threats, but to date there are few methods to predict in advance where new infectious disease threats are most likely to arise.  In this project, researchers seek to understand why some animals harbor many more human pathogens compared to others; what kinds of pathogens are most likely to pose unforeseen disease threats to humans; and what kinds of environments may see large disease outbreak events in the future.  To do this, researchers will analyze large databases on mammals, their pathogens, and environmental conditions to describe what features best predict animal-borne infectious diseases in humans. Researchers will also examine the theoretical consequences of these predictions using mathematical models, to understand how disease patterns are most likely to change over time. Instead of reacting to new diseases after they have emerged, the predictions and methodological advances developed in this project will immediately benefit society by informing us how future disease threats may be preempted.<br/><br/>By combining machine learning and mathematical modeling with growing volumes of data on infectious diseases in wildlife and humans, this project will: (1) Identify intrinsic traits of hosts and pathogens and general environmental features that best predict patterns of zoonotic infection; (2) Identify particular mammal species and pathogenic agents likely to be undiscovered sources of future zoonoses; (3) Investigate the host, pathogen, and environmental covariates that distinguish infection from zoonotic disease in humans, and that combine to predict outbreak size; (4) Fit mathematical models (theory) to empirically observed patterns to derive potential underlying processes; (5) Investigate paradigmatic eco-epidemiological mechanisms through which empirically observed traits of hosts, pathogens, and changing environments influence transmission processes and disease dynamics."

Mangroves provide a number of ecosystem services that are particularly beneficial to low-income coastal communities. However, dependence on natural resources can lead to environmental degradation. Despite the importance of this interaction, there is a significant gap in understanding the relationship between mangrove ecosystem services and poverty traps, mechanisms that cause poverty to persist, in low income coastal communities. This interdisciplinary research is a first step toward advancing our understanding of ecosystem services through the lens of poverty traps. It empirically investigates important feedback loops, drivers and other mechanisms that link poverty traps and mangrove ecosystems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project will inform stakeholders involved in coastal resource management and poverty alleviation how changes in mangrove ecosystem services are associated with poverty and vice versa, and examine new approaches to break the vicious cycle of resource degradation and poverty. The findings can potentially be extended to efforts to sustain ecosystem services provided by other natural resources in developing economies.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted in rural coastal Tanzania where degradation of mangrove resources and persistent poverty continue to be significant challenges. An interdisciplinary research team with expertise in economics, ecology, hydrology, climatology, and system modeling will undertake a two-year study to conceptualize and provide empirical evidence for the feedback loops, drivers, and thresholds existing within and across natural and human systems for multiple ecogeomorphological and poverty conditions. The researchers will collect and use a wide range of ecological and socioeconomic data by synchronizing the temporal and spatial scales at four sites. Four ecosystem services of mangrove forests that are likely interlinked with poverty will be examined: (a) goods extracted (fuel wood, building poles, and charcoal), (b) fish and shrimp habitats, (c) coastal protection, and (d) prospects for carbon storage (as a net carbon sink),which will be assessed as a potential source of revenue to break poverty-environment traps. The ecological processes of mangrove ecosystem functions and their services, as well as the decision rules related to natural resource use, management, and livelihood inferred from empirical evidence will then be used to build an agent-based model to scale up to a regional level. This approach will help identify system-wide effects under alternative scenarios and simulate directions in which the coupled systems can evolve to benefit both the environment and coastal communities."

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which microbes convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere to a form that can be used by the plant to make proteins, DNA, and other compounds crucial for life. This process is well-documented for legumes, i.e. plants that house nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, but it can also occur for grasses where a wide range of bacteria appear to fix nitrogen by a process known as associative nitrogen fixation. Many details of associative nitrogen fixation remain unknown, including its ecosystem importance, the microbial taxa that fix the nitrogen, and the ecological relationships driving its occurrence. Associative nitrogen fixation has potential significance for many ecosystems, and in agriculture it may help to meet the fertilizer requirements of perennial grasses grown for forage and bioenergy. If perennial grasses could get most of their nitrogen from biological fixation, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, which reduces both costs to farmers and the negative environmental consequences associated with synthetic fertilizer use. The goals of this research are to determine when and how much associative nitrogen fixation occurs in perennial grasses, identify the microbial taxa fixing nitrogen, and explore the relationship between the plant and nitrogen-fixing microbes.  The project will also provide research experiences and develop teaching materials for K-12 teachers and students. <br/><br/>The research will use stable isotope tracers to trace the nitrogen in switchgrass, a well-studied perennial grass native to North American prairies. They will trace labeled dinitrogen gas into switchgrass tissues and surrounding soils, as well as into the DNA of the nitrogen-fixing microbial taxa. Carbon will be traced from photosynthesis through the plant and into microbes, which will show whether the nitrogen-fixing microbes are receiving carbon from the plant or from the soil. Finally, the active nitrogen-fixing microbes will be sequenced, with the resultant genomic data providing insights into the functions of the plant microbiome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The island of Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot that is renowned for its distinctive avifauna -- an exceptional diversity of bird species found nowhere else. This project uses Madagascar as a model to address a fundamental question in biology:  why some groups become much more diverse than others over time. The current bird fauna of Madagascar is the result of several independent colonizations from surrounding regions over historical time. Despite arriving in Madagascar millions of years ago, only half the native lineages have subsequently speciated within this large island. This project will focus on a comprehensive investigation of the poorly-studied bird diversity on Madagascar to determine what causes some groups to diversify while others fail to speciate. The study will produce a more accurate assessment of species diversity and diversification patterns, which is crucial for subsequent conservation measures in this highly threatened landscape. This project will promote international collaborations, education and training from high-school to postdoctoral stages, conservation policy, and public outreach activities.<br/><br/>With a strong collaboration of international scientists of diverse backgrounds and expertise, this project will examine all 43 endemic terrestrial avian lineages, including 14 independent radiations, using phylogenetic, biogeographic, and phenotypic data. This study has three main objectives. First, a robust foundation of systematic and biogeographic information for Malagasy avian lineages and their close relatives will be developed to provide more accurate assessments of species diversity within Madagascar, as well as insight into the timing and routes of colonizations. Second, analyses of how and why lineages change in ecology and morphology upon colonization of novel environments will be conducted. These analyses will include large-scale characterization of morphology, plumage, and climatic niche across Malagasy endemic species and their continental relatives to determine the importance of shared and clade-specific evolutionary responses to common environmental settings. Third, predictability of within-island speciation and adaptive radiation will be determined. The research will investigate the probability of radiation after colonization as a function of numerous predictors, including evolutionary lability of trophic morphology, environmental tolerance, and the intrinsic ""speciation potential"" of individual clades. This project is a novel approach towards a comprehensive analysis of a biota and has broad implications for understanding the disparity in species richness across the evolutionary tree of life."

This dominance is largely due to the evolutionary success of one group, the Pentapetalae, characterized by whorled flower parts in multiples of five, which account for over 70% of described species. In contrast, flower parts are arranged in multiples of three (monocots, for example), two, or a variable number in less abundant groups of flowering plants.  The shift to whorled pentamery of the Pentapetalae occurred about 100 million years ago, and appears to have been one of the most successful evolutionary innovations of not only flowering plants, but of green plants in general. This research will investigate the evolution of the underlying genetic changes that contributed to this ancient evolutionary event. It promises to discover the new and/or modified genetic pathways that produced the typical Pentapetalae flower, one of the major mysteries of plant evolution. Several undergraduates will be trained in phylogenetic and molecular biology methods and analyses, and high school teachers will participate in the research through a summer workshop.  Data generated will be shared freely online and will provide tools for other researchers and the public to investigate other questions about flowering plant evolution. <br/><br/>The researchers will sequence genes expressed during flower development in a phylogenetically representative sample of flowering plants and employ state-of-the-art transcriptome analysis techniques to achieve three major goals. Firstly, phylogenetic relationships among lineages subtending the Pentapetalae clade will be reconstructed. Robustly resolved phylogenetic relationships of the lineages preceding the shift to the pentamerous whorled flower are currently lacking but pivotal to interpreting the evolutionary sequence of genetic changes that underlie this key morphological innovation. Secondly, several comparative methods will be used to identify, date, and determine the evolutionary impact of whole-genome and/or gene duplication event(s) that predate the origin of the Pentapetalae. The occurrence of whole-genome duplication events prior to Pentapetalae is widely acknowledged but their precise positions are uncertain. Lastly, RNA-seq and in situ hybridization approaches will be used to infer spatial patterns of gene expression in non-Pentapetalae versus Pentapetalae flowers to identify gene expression changes that correlate with a shift to whorled pentamery in the latter. Together, this integration of approaches will provide exciting new insights into our understanding of flowering plant evolution"

These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both.

A century of research has presumed that forest trees can exclusively use inorganic nitrogen (i.e., ammonium and nitrate) to fuel their growth. However, recent work has suggested that plants may have access to additional types of nitrogen in the form of more complex organic molecules (organic N) also present in the soil. The key to this story is that nearly all forest trees form symbiotic relationships with fungi that dwell on plant roots below ground.  These fungi act to extend the root system of plants and increase plant access to limiting nutrients, including organic N. This research will explore the capacity for certain groups of fungi to provide forest trees with organic forms of nitrogen.  More specifically, this work will explore the unknown capacity of such fungi to decompose soil organic matter using enzymes, thereby releasing organic N in soil organic matter for plant uptake. The broad goal of this research project, then is to understand the extent which these root-associated fungi are liberating organic N in soil for use by trees.  This project will also provide K-12 teachers with age-appropriate teaching tools to build students' understanding of forest ecology. <br/><br/>Recent global level modeling efforts indicate that trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists will be fertilized by increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Other evidence suggests that the large stocks of C in forest soils are a result of the enzymatic activity of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Both models rest upon the hereto untested general claim that ECM fungi mobilize N from the large pools of soil organic matter (SOM). However, direct evidence that ECM fungi can function in this manner is lacking. Understanding the extent to which these organisms obtain organic N by degrading SOM is contingent on whether genes encoding enzymes that mediate both the decay of plant detritus and SOM, were retained during their evolutionary history and are deployed when in symbiosis with plant roots. Multiple lines of indirect evidence, stemming from whole genome sequencing and field data indicate that only certain evolutionary lineages of ECM fungi have the potential to provision their plant hosts with N that is obtained from SOM. Resolving the saprotrophic physiology of ECM fungi across a range of spatial scales and soil N conditions, holds promise to resolve the ecological forces governing where we may expect plants to commonly obtain growth-limiting N from SOM via the activity of their ECM mutualists. Accordingly, this project will use a synthetic whole-plant system to measure the enzymatic expression of genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes across a wide phylogenetic range of ECM fungi, and will also trace organic N into intact plants. After validating this mechanism in the laboratory, the occurrence of this phenomenon will be tested using meta-transcriptomic enabled field approaches. Overall, the research will span gradients in soil N availability occurring at both the local and ecosystem level scales to improve understanding of the factors that structure the distribution of ECM fungi that obtain N from SOM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ecological and evolutionary effects of these changes on aquatic plants and animals are poorly understood, but will likely become more common in the coming decades. This project will make use of 70-year records of the largest water development project in U.S. history to determine how changes in water flow and amount have altered the ecology and evolution of small aquatic animals. An exciting part of the study involves resurrecting these animals from eggs buried in mud for up to 70 years.  Their genes will be compared to modern-day individuals to understand what changes have taken place and why those changes have occurred.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored, learning cutting-edge genetic techniques, experimental design, statistical analyses, and scientific writing.  Results will be communicated to the public through outreach to public schools, collaboration with volunteer citizen scientists, a blog and a website.<br/><br/>Understanding the structure of spatial processes is a critical need in ecology. Dispersal is one such process and a primary mechanism by which species respond to a rapidly changing environment; it is also important in determining the structure of communities and functioning of ecosystems.  However, understanding dispersal's role can be confounded by rapid adaptation of species, which is affected by the spatial structure of the environment and priority effects. The goal of this study is to measure ecological and evolutionary responses of invertebrate populations across a period of change in a complex environmental mosaic, using a new approach: landscape paleogenetics.  Hypotheses will be tested using the Columbia Basin Project as an extraordinarily large experimental system. The study will exploit a unique feature of some invertebrates, prolonged dormancy, to trace population-level shifts over decades of changes in water distribution. A combination of landscape surveys, historical ecological data going back 70 years, DNA analysis, and landscape genetics will be employed."

Much evidence suggests that parasites play an important role in both the origin and the maintenance of biological diversity. This project focuses on one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: herbivorous insects, their parasites, and their microbes. The project targets three economically important groups of organisms: plants in the pumpkin/cucumber family, true fruit flies that attack these plants, and parasitic wasps that kill the flies. These wasps belong to a highly diverse and little studied group of species. Each wasp species can kill only one fly species; wasps attacking the ""wrong"" species of fly die. These bi-directional lethal interactions may be mediated by microbes (in wasps, flies, or both), by traits of flies' immune systems, or both. This project is designed to uncover the mechanisms (evolutionary, ecological, and immunological) affecting interactions that may help explain the diversity of life. Many species of true fruit flies are major agricultural pests; this project will greatly increase knowledge about factors contributing to their susceptibility to parasitoids. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) defenses of parasites and their hosts affect diversification rates; 2) mechanisms of virulence differ among lineages, and 3) selection arising from predator-prey interactions can affect rates of species-formation.

When new infectious diseases emerge, the effects on humans, agriculture and wildlife are sometimes devastating, as exemplified by Ebola, avian influenza, and West Nile virus.  However, other emergent diseases are much less severe, and may even go unnoticed.  The ability to predict the level of harm (i.e. virulence) that an emergent pathogen will cause is limited. This project will improve our ability to predict the severity of emerging diseases by identifying the factors that influence changes in virulence after the infection of a new host species. An extensive body of work has attempted to address this question. Almost all this work has the same shortcoming, key data are not available from the very start of the host-pathogen interaction. Host jumps mark the beginning of a host-pathogen interaction and they therefore provide the only opportunity to study entire trajectories of virulence evolution. The fish virus IHNV (infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus) in rainbow trout and salmon is one of the few systems where samples are available to look at these changes from the beginning for two, independent host jumps, making it an ideal research model.  Insights from the study of these host jumps will inform how best to allocate resources to combat the public health, economic, and biodiversity impacts of emerging diseases.  The project will also involve building capacity for the management of infectious disease through the education and training of graduate students, undergraduates, and technicians, with a focus on under-represented groups. <br/><br/>Whether the virulence of a pathogen will evolve upwards or downward after emergence in a new host, is a foundational question in evolutionary ecology and infectious disease management. Suitable systems for such studies are rare because they require 1) an extensive collection of pathogen isolates sampled before and after host jumps, which span enough time for evolution to occur, 2) ecologically relevant ancestral and new hosts in which to do common garden experiments, and 3) the ability to measure virulence and key fitness components such as transmission potential in these experiments. The virus IHNV is one of the few pathogens that meet these requirements.  IHNV has been both endemic and epidemic in many salmonid fish populations of the Pacific Northwest since the 1950s, and made two independent host jumps into rainbow trout.  This research will utilize a collection of 3000 IHNV isolates that covers the two host jump events and five subsequent decades to pursue four research foci. (1) Experimental determination of viral virulence throughout emergence (2) Experimental determination of viral transmission potential throughout emergence. (3) Whole genome sequencing to determine genetic correlates of virulence and transmission potential. (4) Mathematical modeling to dissect the selective forces driving virulence evolution and assess the evolutionary risks of environmental change.  The research is expected to show that interactions between virulence, transmission potential, and the ecological setting can be used to explain changes in the virulence of an emerging pathogen over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is focused on understanding processes that control where microbes live and how they respond to changes in local conditions. A tree exists in a given location if it can survive both the environmental conditions and interactions with its neighbors at that location, and its seedlings may disperse to new locations with new environmental conditions. Unlike trees, microbes frequently migrate as whole communities and in tandem with their environment, often merging with other microbial communities along with their respective environments. For instance, wind movement of soil particles across the landscape or human handshakes result in novel contact of previously separated microbial communities. This process is termed community coalescence. The confluence of two water bodies is a clear example of community coalescence, resulting in a new, united environment with novel interactions among the previously separate microbial communities. This research will experimentally identify how aquatic microbial communities interact and respond to the merger under different environmental conditions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how microbial communities from distinct habitats interact under community coalescence, with the following specific objectives: (1) Characterize the membership of microbial communities in the field and their activity at three distinct aquatic environments where coalescence occurs. (2) In the laboratory, track microbial community membership and activity in response to experimentally-imposed coalescence. (3) Analyze experimental data in the context of the patterns observed in the field. Unraveling mechanisms that determine community membership following a coalescence event is difficult, since the abiotic and biotic factors are intertwined. In order to understand the true community ecology of microbes, it is necessary to separate the environmental and biological factors that ultimately determine which organisms persist and which do not. To address these fundamental ecological questions, the research team developed a new approach to directly measure the effects of environmental factors and biotic interactions, independently and in combination, on coalesced communities. This project addresses fundamental concepts in community ecology, dispersal of a massive number of microorganisms in the context of aquatic systems, and directly disentangles biotic and abiotic factors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, biologists have suggested that the sharing of genes and traits between different species (hybridization) may play an important, but overlooked role. If true, this not only calls into question our understanding of how species form, but changes how we evaluate the relationships between species. In this project, researchers from San Diego State University and UC Berkeley will link studies of phylogeny and behavior to understand the role of hybridization in the evolution of a large genus of jumping spiders (Habronattus) from North America. The team will develop genomic resources to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between species and to statistically test for the presence of hybridization in driving biodiversity patterns. Additionally, because hybridization occurs only when individuals of different species mate with each other, the team will examine the mating behaviors that control the exchange of genes and traits between separate species thus allowing insight into the mechanisms that drive larger evolutionary patterns. This project will advance our understanding of how species and populations of animals change and how we evaluate their evolutionary relationships. Research findings and techniques will be used to develop freely available statistical tools for scientists, online biodiversity databases, and educational spider-centric computer games to teach key aspects of systematic biology, in particular sexual selection and speciation. Two postdocs, one doctoral student, and multiple undergraduate students at three separate U.S. institutions will be trained on this project. Undergraduate students will play important roles in research, with high potential for independent projects.<br/><br/>This research will advance Habronattus research, and the field of introgressive hybridization biology, in multiple ways. At both phylogenomic and phylogeographic scales the researchers will quantify the balance between tree-like divergence and reticulate evolution, addressing whether phenotypic evolution is better explained by introgressive hybridization rather than a tree-based model. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be conducted to ask whether courtship complexity is correlated with rates of lineage diversification, introgression, and chromosome evolution. Finding widespread introgression concentrated in groups with the most complex courtship would contradict expectations of animal communication theory. Genomic-scale data will provide a consistent, objective framework for interpreting species limits, unbiased by male ornament ""conspicuousness"". At the behavioral level, the researchers will address the proximate mechanisms behind introgressive hybridization, addressing whether hybridization is best explained by errors in species recognition or selection for novel phenotypes. Large empirical genomic and phenotypic datasets will promote the development of new computer program modules to map phenotypic characters impacted by introgressive hybridization or incomplete lineage sorting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hypothesis to be tested is that whenever bacteria accrue non-genetic damage, such as oxidized proteins, it is more advantageous for a mother cell to reproduce by allocating asymmetrically more damage to one of her two daughter cells.  Because damage causes a cell to grow more slowly, the daughter receiving less damage is rejuvenated and the one receiving more is aged.  The advantage of asymmetry was predicted by a theoretical analysis conducted with a computational model and it can be illustrated with an investment analogy.  Consider having bank accounts A ($1,000 at 8% yearly) and B ($500 at 6% and $500 at 10%).  If more money is the goal, account B has more after two years.  Partitioning damage asymmetrically generates a fast and a slow growing daughter, and it is equivalent to having account B.  Partitioning damage symmetrically is comparable to account A.  The demonstration that bacteria age would overturn a long standing dogma in biology that aging is a characteristic of only complex and multi-cellular organisms such as humans.  If bacterial aging is real, a scientific paradigm will have shifted and text books will have to be rewritten.  Moreover, if aging is universal to both bacteria and humans, a common mechanism may exist and the results of this study would help guide research on aging in all organisms.  If there is a common mechanism, a common solution may also exist.  The fact that human aging is often also associated with oxidative damage is already a promising link.<br/><br/>A unicellular origin of aging does not require natural selection on groups because it is the fitness of the lineage that is maximized by the asymmetrical partitioning of damage. Two sets of experiments with the bacterium Escherichia coli will be completed to test the proposed models of aging in the supported research.  First, the effect of short term variation in the level of damage experienced by a single bacterial species will be examined.  Second, the degree of asymmetry will be estimated and compared for different bacterial species that have evolved over long term under high levels of damage.  Damage levels will be manipulated by adding extrinsic damage agents (e.g. heat, peroxides, antibiotics, and radiation).  The analyses of the theoretical models predict (i) that short term variation in damage levels causes the bacteria to transition from immortality to mortality and (ii) that long term exposure to high levels leads to the evolution of higher degrees of asymmetry.  The degree of asymmetry is quantified by the asymmetry parameter in the models.

A popular idea is that predators control disease outbreaks by killing infected prey which are weaker and thereby easier to capture. However, this proposal warns that predators may sometimes spread disease in host populations. The researchers will use organisms living in lakes to test five ways in which predators could spread disease. These ideas are that predators: (1) while eating prey, physically spread parasites into prey habitat; (2) can increase food supply for prey, and more food can cause higher parasite production within infected hosts; (3) can shift the composition of prey populations towards certain ages and sizes that get infected more easily; (4) can kill other species that control disease; and (5) can cause genetic changes to prey populations, making them more susceptible to disease organisms. The project will focus on water fleas (the hosts), a deadly fungal parasite, and an insect predator to test these possibilities. The research uses these organisms as a model system: outbreaks of this fungus can be sampled in lakes, created in experiments within lakes and in the lab, and can be understood using mathematical models. These new ideas, once tested thoroughly in the lab and verified in nature, will help managers make prudent decisions on how to control disease outbreaks in wild and domestic animal populations. The project will train many students, and focus on engaging those in underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This project integrates three approaches. First, it will invest in a survey of fungal epidemics in water flea hosts in 40 lakes. The data from this large survey will be used to generate complex statistical models that test the first four mechanisms (ideas) given above. Second, it uses controlled experiments. One experiment will test mechanisms (2)-(4) with factorial manipulation of predatory insects and ""competitor-diluters"" (other water flea species which eat parasite propagules). A second experiment will investigate details of mechanisms (1)-(3). A third experiment investigates a tradeoff among clonal genotypes of the host; genotypes which better escape predation are more vulnerable to parasites. The hypothesis is that predators will shift host populations, via rapid evolution, towards bigger epidemics via this tradeoff. Third, this project develops a new suite of parameterized, mathematical (dynamical) models, designed to evaluate each of the mechanisms separately and together."

Because invasion of pathogens into new host populations can have dramatic effects on hosts, including humans, ecologists have long studied the causes and consequences of pathogen invasion. Previous work has focused on situations in which pathogens invade host populations that are stable and already established. That work does not help us understand infectious disease in two other situations that are important: when a new host species is spreading across a landscape (where disease might help slow its spread) and when a rare host species is deliberately reintroduced as part of a conservation program (where disease is a threat to conservation goals). This project will be the first in-depth study of the second situation. It will explore how a rare host and common pathogen interact from the initial reintroduction of the host and invasion of the pathogen to their long-term persistence or die-out. The investigators will study an endangered Island Fox population, recently reintroduced to a California island. The foxes are now experiencing a major outbreak of a disease called leptospirosis, which causes major health problems for humans and wildlife around the world. This project will build understanding of how leptospirosis spreads in wildlife and eventually can infect humans and livestock. Island foxes are a rare success story in which Endangered Species Act protections have enabled the fox population to recover; this work will guide future management of Island Foxes.  More generally, this work will inform risk assessment and disease control in other reintroduction programs.  The project includes outreach efforts to inform the public, including southern California school-children, about conservation and disease issues.<br/><br/>The study system is the Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) on Santa Rosa Island, California. After a population crash in the late 1990s, all 14 remaining foxes on Santa Rosa were taken into captivity. A reintroduction program, beginning in 2004, reestablished foxes on the island, but an outbreak of Leptospira interrogans (the agent of leptospirosis) was discovered in 2010. Analysis of banked serum samples showed that the outbreak was already widespread on the island by 2009-10, and the pathogen likely invaded the fox population as it re-colonized the island after fox reintroduction. The island spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis) was also found to be infected, and genetic analyses indicate a close link to a Leptospira strain circulating in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) that frequent the island. Extensive sample banks and population monitoring data provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct the history of this pathogen invasion. This project will integrate field, laboratory, genomic and modeling approaches. Its goals are to determine the source of Leptospira in the Santa Rosa outbreak, characterize transmission dynamics in the island community throughout the establishment process, predict whether Leptospira will persist on the island, and assess the impact of Leptospira on fox health and conservation. The investigators will generalize the findings to extract lessons and tools to be applied to other disease systems."

Disturbances such as fires can drastically change resource availability to plants. For example, ecosystems that experience frequent fires also experience surges of nitrogen availability after the fire. Although nitrogen is a crucial resource for all plants, nitrogen not captured by plants can be washed away and contribute to the pollution of streams and lakes. As such, it is important to understand how plant diversity might change if nitrogen availability changes, and subsequently how the ability of the plant community to retain nitrogen might also change. Investigators will examine whether plant communities that have experienced frequent pulses of nitrogen are better able to capture nitrogen and prevent it from leaving the ecosystem than are plant communities that have not experienced nitrogen pulses. This research will help to predict how plant communities respond to changes in nitrogen availability, and how patterns of nitrogen retention and loss are affected by fire frequency. As part of this project, one undergraduate student will gain hands-on experience in field ecology and laboratory chemical analyses.  In addition, the investigators will develop teaching activities to improve understanding of N cycling at local and global scales by undergraduate students. Data from this study will be added to a database used to estimate the global carbon cycle. The findings of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at national conferences.<br/><br/>This project is an empirical field test of patterns identified in greenhouse studies of interspecific differences in pulsed nitrogen assimilation. The researchers will trace the fate of nitrogen into different ecosystem compartments in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest, using isotope analysis in sites with contrasting historical fire frequencies (annual burns or fire suppression). Researchers will measure the amount of isotope stored in microbial biomass, aboveground and belowground biomass of dominant plant species, and the bulk soil pool. By comparing the amount of nitrogen stored in different compartments between sites under annual burn or fire suppression regimes, they will assess the extent to which plant communities exposed to frequent nitrogen pulses are adapted to capturing this ephemeral resource. Further, they will test whether these interspecific differences in the capacity to capture pulsed nitrogen scale up to influence ecosystem-level nitrogen retention patterns in the field. The researchers predict that shifts in community composition favoring species adapted to assimilating ephemeral nitrogen will result in increased nitrogen retention in frequently burned sites, as compared to fire-suppressed sites."

These male-harming mutations are not removed because the effects of natural selection acting on males are not passed to the next generation. Most familiar organisms have a large genome that resides in the nucleus of their cells, which is inherited from both parents, plus a small genome in the mitochondria. The mitochondria are the batteries of each cell, which are inherited only from the mother. Mitochondrial gene products interact with nuclear gene products to perform critical life functions. Male-harming mutations are predicted to accumulate in the mitochondrial genome and result in their reduced fitness. The project will examine interactions between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and the effects on male and female fitness in a small marine shellfish, the copepod Tigriopus californicus. The results will test whether the hypothesized negative effects on male fitness are widespread and examine whether and how the nuclear-mitochondrial interactions impact these effects. This hypothesis has profound implications for sex-specific medical interventions, because harmful mitochondrial mutations are implicated in male infertility, and diseases such as diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and male deafness, as well as in the overall aging process.

Genes involved in adaptation or isolation between species are frequently located in regions of a chromosome where the ancestral gene order has flipped. These inverted chromosome regions block gene exchange between closely related species, which allows the genes inside them to evolve independently. It is not known whether those key genes are randomly spread inside the inversions or whether they are more likely found close to the edges or the center of those inverted regions. Circumventing the barriers to genetic analyses posed by inversions will allow researchers to learn the genetic basis of species divergence and adaptation. This project will use the Drosophila (fruit fly) genome editing toolkit to reverse the outcome of the evolutionary process and flip back the large chromosomal inversions that separate Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. This will allow unprecedented analyses of important species divergence traits linked to these inversions. This research will also have educational impacts in K-12 education and teacher training via collaboration with public school teachers from local minority high schools. Moreover, chromosome inversions cause many important human diseases. Understanding where the critical sequences lie is fundamental to development of treatment of those diseases. <br/><br/>An important mechanism that allows species to persist in the face of gene flow is the presence of chromosomal inversions. Although considered impermeable barriers to gene flux in heterozygotes, chromosomal inversions can exchange genetic material via double-crossovers or non-crossover gene conversion. Those processes should be more common in the central regions of inversions. Theoretical studies thus predict that nucleotide divergence between species differing by inversions should be higher at the breakpoint regions relative to the center, and that adaptive or reproductive isolation genes should also be more likely located towards the breakpoints. Tests of the first prediction have been conducted using population genetic or comparative genomic data, resulting in a range of inconsistent patterns suggesting that theoretical models may oversimplify the expected effects of inversions on recombination. Test of the second prediction, on the other hand, have been impossible to conduct because inversions reduce or impede recombination in hybrids, precluding fine scale genetic analysis of interspecific differences at those genomic regions. To overcome this limitation, this project will leverage CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to revert two fixed inversions between the sibling fruit fly species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The strains that will be generated will be used for genetic mapping of reproductive isolation factors (hybrid male sterility), and for an experimental evolution study that will test whether and how much chromosomal inversions facilitate the persistence of hybridizing species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 400 species of Schefflera occur in this vast region, especially in the very mountainous areas of the northern Andes.  Many of these species have only been seen by scientists once or a few times, and almost half do not yet have scientific names.  Moreover, very few tools are available to recognize and identify these ecologically important plants, and we know almost nothing about how they evolved into so many different forms, or how they were able to adapt to the wide range of habitats.  The strategy of this study, which includes field work in four Andean countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), aims to improve our understanding of these evolutionary processes.  It will also focus on identifying and naming the species that occur in a limited number of places and are most threatened with extinction (mostly by tropical deforestation) so that they can be targeted by conservation efforts.  The information generated by the project will be made available on-line to a wide range of users, both within and beyond the scientific community.  To help develop the next generation of plant systematists, 12 undergraduate students will be given an opportunity to learn about this important yet under-appreciated branch of botany through two 6-week summer internship programs at the Missouri and New York Botanical Gardens, and 12 more advanced students in botany or biology will participate in a tropical field botany program, joining the project scientists to gain hands-on experience during field work in South America.<br/><br/>The research will involve constructing phylogenies for the species of Andean Schefflera using DNA-based evidence, taking advantage of recent advances in technology, especially high-throughput approaches to DNA sequencing.  The phylogenies will provide a greater understanding of the major lineages of these 400+ species, which in turn will provide a framework for classifying and naming them, and for understanding their evolutionary and geographic relationships.  A streamlined 'green-listing' approach to assessing conservation status of the species that are most likely to be threatened will inform priorities for naming and conserving new and rare Andean members of Schefflera.  Intensive herbarium studies will provide sources of geographic, morphological, and molecular data, and will guide field work in the countries of the central and northern Andes, targeting sites with the highest concentration of species that remain unsampled, and focusing on areas in southern Ecuador and northern Peru where the group appears to have undergone exceptional diversification.  Time-dated phylogenies will be used to explore biogeographic scenarios and to test for correlations among morphology, ecology, geography and evolutionary history, providing insights into the evolution of plant diversity in the Andes.  These studies will be conducted with the collaboration of local botanists and students from each of the four South American countries where field work will be done. This will  promote a long-term network of international researchers capable of sustaining the long-term goals of fully documenting and understanding the tremendous diversity of Schefflera in the tropical Andes."

Recent evidence suggests that, while forests will grow better as they recover from acid rain, the soil in forests may also lose a substantial amount of the carbon and nutrients.  In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) project, the student is working to understand the mechanisms by which forest recovery from acid rain may increase the vulnerability of soil organic matter that contains soil carbon and nutrients. The investigators are particularly interested in understanding how rising soil acidity and calcium content may alter the solubility and lability (decomposability) of soil carbon.  The project will test this by studying the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils in response to changing acidity.  This research is necessary to predict  future trends of forest growth and carbon storage throughout the Northeastern United States. To facilitate and inform evidence-based management decisions, this research will be incorporated into a web-based application that is geared toward letting the general public explore and understand long-term ecological data.<br/> <br/>To examine the mechanisms by which ecosystem recovery from acid rain may alter soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, the researchers will perform a long-term greenhouse mesocosm experiment. Soils will be collected from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a Northeastern hardwood forest that is impacted by acid rain. The team will reconstruct soil mesocosms by horizon, both with and without sugar maple seedlings, a co-dominant species in the forest where the soils were obtained. Soils will be experimentally amended to increase soil pH and Ca in a fully factorial design. The student will measure SOM solubility and microbial respiration of SOM to determine the responses of SOM pools to these treatments. In addition, researchers will measure proximate mechanisms of SOM dynamics (Aluminum-SOM complexation, soil exoenzyme activity, bacterial:fungal microbial biomass ratios, etc.) that may drive changes to SOM solubility and microbial respiration. These measurements will be compared between planted and unplanted mesocosm to identify possible plant-mediated effects on SOM dynamics."

This project takes advantage of planned dam removals that will connect fish populations that have been separated for nearly four centuries, in order to study the ecological and evolutionary consequences of secondary contact between these recently divergent fish populations, which may interbreed but also may compete. Results from this work will contribute to the conservation and management of migratory alewife fish, a critical resource in coastal freshwater and marine habitats and the focus of intensive restoration and conservation efforts. Researchers will work collaboratively with state managers, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, lake associations, and land trusts to determine the consequences of restoring migratory populations, provide information vital to alewife recovery, and educate local communities on the consequences of river restoration. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher along with graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary project that relies on advanced genetics techniques, field sampling, and manipulative field and laboratory experiments. An existing program at Yale University will support involvement of underrepresented minority undergraduate students in summer research. Training will include the broader scientific context of the research, research methods, data analysis, written and oral project reports, and direct involvement with the public to present the societal benefits of the research. <br/><br/>This project takes advantage of whole-lake restoration projects to understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of secondary contact between recently diverged lineages of alewife. Isolation caused by construction of dams has resulted in two divergent alewife life history forms: the ancestral anadromous form that moves between lakes and the coastal ocean and a landlocked form that is resident in lakes. This project will combine advanced genomics, small-scale experiments, and whole-lake observations and experiments to document and understand the consequences of secondary contact, when dam removal allows reintroduction of anadromous alewife into lakes that contain the land-locked form. Close collaboration with the state agency that removes dams will allow the investigators to study secondary contact from its initiation. The project addresses three stages in response to secondary contact: rapid ecological change in planktonic communities and nutrient flux, rapid evolutionary responses in invertebrate populations in response to novel ecological conditions, and interactions between the two alewife morphs that may result in hybridization and, over the longer-term, alewife evolution and local adaptation. The first of these responses - ecological changes in lacustrine communities - is essential in order to interpret the evolutionary changes that result. The project is unique in its ability to capture the consequences of secondary contact on both time scales. Results will provide rare insight into feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes in field populations following secondary contact with important implications for ecosystem function and the maintenance of biodiversity in restored ecosystems."

While many plants respond to warmer springs by flowering earlier, a significant number of species do not respond, and some even show delayed flowering. Such patterns are inconsistent with predictions based on well-understood physiological responses to temperature.  For plants that grow in boreal forest, however, the process that ends in the bursting of flower buds actually begins a year or more before flowers open, a developmental process known as ""preformation"". This research will test the hypothesis that the effects of rising temperatures on the extended period of preformation explain delayed flowering.  The effects of rising temperatures on preformation may limit the extent to which plants can adapt to environmental variability. The discovery of a strong role for development could dramatically improve our ability to predict the timing of flowering in high-latitude communities and may also provide insights into how temperate trees and shrubs, the majority of which preform flowers, will respond to increasing temperatures. This project will also involve citizen scientists, who will obtain phenology, temperature and snow depth data from across Alaska.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate three potential effects of warm temperatures on the development of flower primordia: increasing temperatures could 1) induce early bud set and dormancy; 2) induce more rapid development and / or a delay in bud set so that some buds mature in the fall of the year in which they were initiated; and 3) delay flower initiation. Eight species of understory boreal shrubs will be studied; their small stature makes them amenable to experimental temperature manipulation, and because they are woody they likely share features of preformation with the dominant trees and shrubs of diverse plant communities. Open-topped chambers will be used to raise temperatures for one or two growing seasons, and development will be followed over the course of three years. Temperature will be related to potential developmental determinants of flower opening: timing of initiation, rate of development, and cessation of growth. By manipulating and analyzing the effects of time of snow melt, date of growth initiation and temperature across the entire multi-year trajectory of flower development for representative species, the researchers will identify the mechanisms that underlie ""non-typical"" phenological responses."

Recent studies have found that, compared to common species, rare tropical tree species suffer more from pathogens that are specialized to a single host species that then spread rapidly through dense patches of seedlings of that single host.  This research will test the novel hypothesis that rare species are more strongly impacted by host-specific pathogens because they have lower diversity of resistance genes at the population level, such that all their seedlings will be susceptible to the same suite of pathogens, promoting rapid pathogen spread and increasing mortality rates.  This hypothesis will be tested using experimental greenhouse and field studies, combined with genetic analyses that will quantify the diversity of resistance genes for rare and common tree species in lowland tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Computer simulations will also be used to examine whether the measured differences in resistance gene diversity would impact infection levels, mortality rates and local abundance of tree species. Results of this study will improve understanding of plant-pathogen interactions, with potential applications for agriculture and horticulture (e.g. increasing pathogen resistance in crops). Hands-on training in cutting-edge genetic techniques would be provided to a wider audience through a summer workshop for students and faculty.<br/><br/>This study will be the first to obtain large transcriptome datasets from a tree community and will provide gene sequence data that will be informative for future studies of genetic diversity in tropical forests. Examination of the effects of resistance gene diversity on forest dynamics will bridge the gap between molecular evolution studies that indicate ongoing selection for multiple resistance genes at many loci, and how this diversity functions in nature. Furthermore, this study is likely to bridge competing theories for tropical plant diversity by providing a genetic explanation for why rare tree species are more strongly controlled by their species-specific enemies, while simultaneously supporting dispersal limitation as a feature determining which species are locally dominant. Ultimately, the study should elucidate whether local rarity restricts local genetic diversity, which in turn reinforces local rarity, a cycle that can be escaped only by recruitment of new alleles via long-distance pollen or seed movement. Demonstrating such a coupling between the ecological and genetic features of populations would bring new perspectives and avenues for theoretical advances in evolution and ecology.

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which microbes convert nitrogen gas in the atmosphere to a form that can be used by the plant to make proteins, DNA, and other compounds crucial for life. This process is well-documented for legumes, i.e. plants that house nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules, but it can also occur for grasses where a wide range of bacteria appear to fix nitrogen by a process known as associative nitrogen fixation. Many details of associative nitrogen fixation remain unknown, including its ecosystem importance, the microbial taxa that fix the nitrogen, and the ecological relationships driving its occurrence. Associative nitrogen fixation has potential significance for many ecosystems, and in agriculture it may help to meet the fertilizer requirements of perennial grasses grown for forage and bioenergy. If perennial grasses could get most of their nitrogen from biological fixation, it reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers, which reduces both costs to farmers and the negative environmental consequences associated with synthetic fertilizer use. The goals of this research are to determine when and how much associative nitrogen fixation occurs in perennial grasses, identify the microbial taxa fixing nitrogen, and explore the relationship between the plant and nitrogen-fixing microbes.  The project will also provide research experiences and develop teaching materials for K-12 teachers and students. <br/><br/>The research will use stable isotope tracers to trace the nitrogen in switchgrass, a well-studied perennial grass native to North American prairies. They will trace labeled dinitrogen gas into switchgrass tissues and surrounding soils, as well as into the DNA of the nitrogen-fixing microbial taxa. Carbon will be traced from photosynthesis through the plant and into microbes, which will show whether the nitrogen-fixing microbes are receiving carbon from the plant or from the soil. Finally, the active nitrogen-fixing microbes will be sequenced, with the resultant genomic data providing insights into the functions of the plant microbiome.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been assumed that the carbon stored in soil represents the ""leftovers"" - plant-derived compounds that cannot be broken down any further by soil microorganisms. Recent work has shown that, as soil microorganisms decompose plant materials, they can produce compounds that increase carbon storage in soil. Thus, soil microorganisms are important to both the breakdown and the buildup of soil carbon. Many questions, however, remain unanswered.  What controls microbial growth, and which aspects of microbial growth should lead to long-term soil carbon storage? These are the questions to be addressed by research through this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant. Experiments will make use of a novel technique to measure rates of microbial production in both a controlled laboratory experiment, and through studies along natural environmental gradients in forests. Results of this project will further our understanding of soil carbon content, and will enhance our ability to predict when and where carbon storage in soils should be greatest. The investigators will work with high school teachers to develop lesson plans and course materials, as well as with high school students directly, to provide training centered around the project objectives. <br/><br/>The conversion of organic inputs into microbial products is fundamentally controlled by three processes: microbial growth rate, microbial growth efficiency, and microbial turnover rate. Yet, despite the theoretical importance of these parameters for stable soil organic matter (SOM) formation, little is known about how these parameters vary with resource availability and environmental conditions, and which of these parameters most strongly controls SOM dynamics. This research will address two questions: 1) How do litter quality and soil properties affect microbial growth rate, efficiency, and turnover? 2) To what extent do changes in these parameters influence SOM formation and soil carbon storage? To date, our understanding of microbial growth physiology has been hindered by the inability of common methods to quantify growth on realistic substrates. To overcome this challenge, the researchers will use a new, substrate-independent method - tracking 18O-labeled water into microbial DNA - to quantify microbial growth parameters in temperate forest soils. First, microbial growth rate, efficiency, and turnover will be quantified across natural gradients of resource availability in six temperate forests in order to determine whether these parameters are consistent with previously-collected SOM data from these same sites. Then, using two isotopically labeled litter decay experiments, the importance of litter quality versus soil properties in controlling microbial growth parameters and the conversion of plant inputs into stable SOM will be evaluated."

A 6-hectare restoration experiment will be used to determine if species' trait syndromes, grouped by resource acquisition strategies, predict the performance of tree species along successional trajectories. In addition to conducting these projects, the researchers will engage the local conservation, forestry, and farming community in a workshop on TDF adaptive management strategies.

The central question motivating this research is how do simple organisms evolve into complex organisms? The origin of organisms composed of more than one cell (i.e., multicellular organisms) was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems, such as plants and animals, to evolve. However, understanding how and why this kind of complexity has increased in some lineages remains a major challenge for evolutionary biology. The challenges posed by the evolution of multicellularity, for example, in the evolution of mechanisms for sharing labor and cooperating among the cells within an organism, underlie many medical conditions and are foundational in understanding genotype to phenotype relationships. The goal of this project is to experimentally evolve multicellularity under controlled conditions and study the pathways involved.

Nutrients feed aquatic plants that support riverine food webs, and it is hypothesized that animal aggregations can influence nutrient pollution. Understanding how these types of biological hotspots interact will further our knowledge of river function and provide targets for river restoration. To understand the ecology of fish and mussel hotspots in rivers, the investigators will use complementary approaches including field monitoring, experiments, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the PIs will train a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate and graduate students as well as organize outreach workshops for K-12 teachers to develop programs associated with water quality and ecosystem services.<br/><br/>The ecological processes that occur at animal aggregations (biogeochemical hotspots) are important for ecosystem health and can help mitigate nutrient pollution. Animal aggregations create patches where processes such as energy transfer and nutrient recycling are higher than outside of patches. Long-lived freshwater mussels live buried in the sediment in localized patches that serve as stable, long-term biogeochemical hotspots. In contrast, where shorter-lived, fish occur depends on flow conditions in rivers. Fish aggregations serve as mobile, widespread, short-term biogeochemical hotspots. This project quantifies the spatial and temporal overlap and interactions between mussel and fish aggregations in rivers. A field study will quantify fish and mussel abundance under different flow conditions in two rivers to determine patch size and location. A correlative field study will quantify ecological services performed by mussel and fish aggregations under low and higher flow conditions. Mesocosm experiments will use chemical techniques to track the movement of nutrients from fish and mussel aggregates through the rest of the food web. Lastly, computer models of ecosystem dynamics will be used to scale from fish and mussel distribution and flow data generated in the small-scale field study up to the whole river scale.

Surprisingly little information exists, however, regarding the capacity of ecological systems to recover after introduced species removal. In particular, only a handful of studies on species invasions combine long-term, pre-invasion data with invader-removal experiments over temporal scales long enough to determine whether or not native species assemblages fully recover. This project will examine the reassembly of native ant communities following the landscape-scale removal of the Argentine ant, a common, widespread and ecologically disruptive introduced species. Following invader removal, researchers will quantify recovery of native ant assemblages with respect to their genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecological function. Multiple approaches, such as those to be employed here, are required to further clarify the rate and extent to which ecosystems recover from this type of environmental change. Broader impacts related to this work include research support for PhD students from UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, a research experience for undergraduates program for students from California State University, Channel Islands (a four-year Hispanic Serving Institution), and a high school outreach program focused on understanding ecological effects of invasive species. <br/><br/>The experimental removal of numerically dominant, introduced species can provide unparalleled opportunities to examine community reassembly. Invader-removal experiments can shed light on how reassembly is influenced by processes acting within a given system or, alternatively, reflects processes acting at larger spatial scales. The objectives of this research are to quantify the structural (genetic diversity, species diversity) and functional (trophic position, ecological function) components of the recovery of native ant assemblages following landscape-scale removal of the non-native Argentine ant. With large-scale eradication treatments on Santa Cruz Island, California, now complete, the project from this point forward will quantify native ant reassembly over a decadal time scale. The central hypothesis is that native assemblages will recover from invader removal but only if reassembly is measured over temporal scales (1) that are commensurate with the life history of focal native species, and (2) that encompass how interspecific interactions change during assemblage formation. This research will provide an unprecedented test of the capacity for native assemblages to regain structure and function after invader removal and also yield novel information about the factors that control the richness, composition and ecological function of an important terrestrial animal assemblage."

Understanding how these types of biological hotspots interact will further our knowledge of river function and provide targets for river restoration. To understand the ecology of fish and mussel hotspots in rivers, the investigators will use complementary approaches including field monitoring, experiments, and mathematical modeling. In addition, the PIs will train a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate and graduate students as well as organize outreach workshops for K-12 teachers to develop programs associated with water quality and ecosystem services.<br/><br/>The ecological processes that occur at animal aggregations (biogeochemical hotspots) are important for ecosystem health and can help mitigate nutrient pollution. Animal aggregations create patches where processes such as energy transfer and nutrient recycling are higher than outside of patches. Long-lived freshwater mussels live buried in the sediment in localized patches that serve as stable, long-term biogeochemical hotspots. In contrast, where shorter-lived, fish occur depends on flow conditions in rivers. Fish aggregations serve as mobile, widespread, short-term biogeochemical hotspots. This project quantifies the spatial and temporal overlap and interactions between mussel and fish aggregations in rivers. A field study will quantify fish and mussel abundance under different flow conditions in two rivers to determine patch size and location. A correlative field study will quantify ecological services performed by mussel and fish aggregations under low and higher flow conditions. Mesocosm experiments will use chemical techniques to track the movement of nutrients from fish and mussel aggregates through the rest of the food web. Lastly, computer models of ecosystem dynamics will be used to scale from fish and mussel distribution and flow data generated in the small-scale field study up to the whole river scale.

Terrestrial plants compete for light, water and soil nutrients. Many birds compete for access to food and nesting sites, and in the intertidal zone, shellfish compete for rocky substrate on which to attach themselves. Classic ecological theory predicts that when competition is important, species can coexist with others by having traits that differentiate their resource needs from those of their competitors. In turn, this prediction has led to the hypothesis that when communities comprise well differentiated species, competition must be a dominant process. Unfortunately, this hypothesis does not support key aspects of modern coexistence theory, which has demonstrated that even very similar competing species can coexist if the competitive advantage is small. This project will address this scientific controversy by developing a general eco-evolutionary mathematical model of intraspecific competition in which competition is explicitly linked to species traits and evolutionarily stable communities are identified. Ultimately, this work will lead to a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of organisms in natural communities and resolve these discrepancies in classic and modern theory. Additionally, this research will provide research training for a postdoctoral researcher and an undergraduate student. A teaching module in theoretical ecology will also be developed for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Most of the theoretical work on trait distributions arising from competitive interactions has assumed that a single trait (or at most a pair of traits) determines both the niche overlap and any fitness differences among competitors.  Under this assumption, trait distributions of climax communities generally demonstrate over-dispersion; however, it has also been shown that clumps of similar species can form at intermediate time-scales when their fitness differences are small (termed ""emergent neutrality""). This project will employ mathematical models of competition to compare patterns of trait variation that emerge under modern coexistence theory to data collected from natural communities. This project will incorporate a greater degree of biological realism than previous approaches, by modulating the extent to which niche differences and fitness differences are controlled by the same trait or different traits. Numerical simulations of a Lotka-Volterra competition model within an eco-evolutionary framework will be used to identify evolutionarily stable communities. The patterns of trait dispersion that develop will be summarized using a variety of metrics to demonstrate the patterns and mechanisms that underlie climax communities when traits have varying degrees of control over fitness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, many herbivores are pests that eat agricultural plants or compete with livestock for food in rangelands.  Past research has focused on three factors that might control herbivore communities: 1) the total amount of plant material available for them to eat, 2) the number of different types of plants available for them to eat, and 3) how much nitrogen and phosphorus (two important nutrients known to be important to herbivore growth) is available in plant material. However, knowing these three things about a particular location has not proved to be enough information to allow scientists to accurately predict how many and what type of herbivores will be present. Recent research has suggested the possibility that other micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, and sodium may help explain how herbivore communities are structured. In the past, scientists thought that these other nutrients were common enough in all plants that they would not affect herbivores. This research will test the hypothesis that some of these micronutrients help to determine the identity and densities of herbivore communities. If this hypothesis is supported, it will suggest novel explanations for what controls herbivore abundance and species composition, which may be helpful for agricultural applications.<br/><br/>Soil micronutrients may benefit or harm herbivores directly (by affecting plant food quality) or indirectly (by altering plant community composition). Preliminary data from a coastal tallgrass prairie in Texas showed that foliar micronutrients were better predictors of herbivore community structure than were plant biomass, diversity or macronutrients, and that soil micronutrient concentration affected feeding of grasshoppers when host plant identity was held constant. This project will support a large, multi-factorial field experiment in a coastal tallgrass prairie located south of Houston that will rigorously test the importance of micronutrients in mediating herbivore abundance and diversity, and determine if the importance of micronutrients 1) depends on macronutrients and 2) varies among herbivore feeding modes and guilds. Complementary mesocosm and laboratory experiments will test potential mechanisms of micronutrient effects; that is, whether micronutrients affect herbivores directly or indirectly. This study will be the first to manipulate macro- and micronutrients in concert for understanding insect community structure, and will do so in the field at an unprecedented scale."

The central question motivating this research is how do simple organisms evolve into complex organisms? The origin of organisms composed of more than one cell (i.e., multicellular organisms) was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems, such as plants and animals, to evolve. However, understanding how and why this kind of complexity has increased in some lineages remains a major challenge for evolutionary biology. The challenges posed by the evolution of multicellularity, in the evolution of mechanisms for sharing labor and cooperating among the cells within an organism, underlie many medical conditions and are foundational in understanding genotype to phenotype relationships. This project will also develop novel curriculum materials for teaching high school students about cellular differentiation and the challenges of multicellularity. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to experimentally evolve multicellularity in the single-celled green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. C. reinhardtii is an established model system with a well-developed set of genetic tools. Its relatives among the volvocine algae range from species having single cells to those having tens of thousands of cells of different cell types. Generation of a novel origin of multicellularity in the lab will enable direct comparison of multicellular descendants to their unicellular ancestors. Twelve replicate populations will be evolved in the presence of a filter-feeding predator, conditions known to favor multicellularity. Genetic changes that occur over the course of these experiments will be tracked to reveal the genetic basis of multicellularity and the evolutionary processes giving rise to those changes. Experimental data will be compared with the evolutionary and genetic routes by which multicellularity evolved in the volvocine algae. Finally, the role of environmentally induced developmental changes in the evolution of multicellularity will be evaluated."

On a global basis, soils store twice as much carbon as is in the atmosphere and regulate the nitrogen supply to maintain plant productivity while preventing excess nitrogen losses. Laboratory studies indicate that rhizosphere priming is likely a key control on soil CO2 emissions and the release of nitrogen from organic matter. However, the control of rhizosphere priming on soil carbon and nitrogen transformations in real ecosystems has been difficult to study and is not well understood. This is important because many environmental changes could alter rhizosphere priming, with potentially large consequences for carbon storage and nitrogen cycling. By measuring carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers in plants and soils, this study will follow the fate of different carbon and nitrogen sources and separate their contributions the functioning of the soil in grasslands of the central United States. This study also uses plants with different kinds of root characteristics to figure out the different influences plants can have on rhizosphere priming. Over three years, this study will address two main questions: (1) What is the magnitude of rhizosphere priming on the breakdown of organic matter under realistic soil conditions? and (2) How do different plant and soil characteristics affect priming across seasons, types of plants and different soils? This project is that start of a comprehensive effort to decipher and ground truth the important roles of of roots in actual grassland ecosystems.<br/><br/>The results of this project will help us understand how changes in plants and environmental conditions affect air quality and the loss of nitrogen from soils.

While many plants respond to warmer springs by flowering earlier, a significant number of species do not respond, and some even show delayed flowering. Such patterns are inconsistent with predictions based on well-understood physiological responses to temperature.  For plants that grow in boreal forest, however, the process that ends in the bursting of flower buds actually begins a year or more before flowers open, a developmental process known as ""preformation"". This research will test the hypothesis that the effects of rising temperatures on the extended period of preformation explain delayed flowering.  The effects of rising temperatures on preformation may limit the extent to which plants can adapt to environmental variability. The discovery of a strong role for development could dramatically improve our ability to predict the timing of flowering in high-latitude communities and may also provide insights into how temperate trees and shrubs, the majority of which preform flowers, will respond to increasing temperatures. This project will also involve citizen scientists, who will obtain phenology, temperature and snow depth data from across Alaska.<br/><br/>This project will evaluate three potential effects of warm temperatures on the development of flower primordia: increasing temperatures could 1) induce early bud set and dormancy; 2) induce more rapid development and / or a delay in bud set so that some buds mature in the fall of the year in which they were initiated; and 3) delay flower initiation. Eight species of understory boreal shrubs will be studied; their small stature makes them amenable to experimental temperature manipulation, and because they are woody they likely share features of preformation with the dominant trees and shrubs of diverse plant communities. Open-topped chambers will be used to raise temperatures for one or two growing seasons, and development will be followed over the course of three years. Temperature will be related to potential developmental determinants of flower opening: timing of initiation, rate of development, and cessation of growth. By manipulating and analyzing the effects of time of snow melt, date of growth initiation and temperature across the entire multi-year trajectory of flower development for representative species, the researchers will identify the mechanisms that underlie ""non-typical"" phenological responses."

Quantifying such factors is important because the structure of tropical forests is rapidly changing.  In particular, the abundance of one major canopy component "" lianas (woody vines) "" is increasing due to disturbance and climate change.  Because lianas physically connect neighboring trees, changes in their abundance should affect the distribution, behavior, and diversity of non-flying animals that live in the canopy. This project tests that hypothesis in Panama by creating a large-scale experiment in which lianas are added or removed from some forest plots and not from others. The project focuses on the response of ants because they are conspicuous, abundant, and play important ecological roles in forests.  The research specifically addresses three interrelated questions.  First, how does the physical connectivity provided by lianas affect ant diversity in tree crowns?  Second, do lianas help restore canopy ant communities in forests that have been cut or otherwise disturbed? Finally, do different ant species prefer to use different types of lianas, and why?  <br/><br/>Tropical rainforests are the world's best classroom for studying biodiversity, and this project provides outstanding opportunities for students at the University of Louisville to gain valuable first-hand research experience in an international setting.  Likewise, local K-12 teachers will collect data in Panama while developing curricula on rainforest conservation for use during the school year.  Because the field site is a popular tourist destination, the project provides a unique opportunity for participants to interact regularly with the general public.  Prior research on rainforest canopies has attracted international media attention, and this project is expected to generate similar public interest.  Finally, the work will reveal how changes in tropical forest structure may shape canopy biodiversity over the next several decades."

The world remains green with plants because a variety of factors limit the intensity of herbivory.  Understanding these limiting factors is an important goal of ecology.  This research focuses on how the seasonal timing of interactions between plants and herbivorous insects could limit herbivory. The project examines interactions between plants and their herbivorous aphids, which form vast colonies on the flowering stalks of the plants, making them an ideal study system for experimental manipulation. The aphid colonies interact with other insects, including ants that provide them with protection from predators. Six years of data show that when snow melts earlier in spring, host plants flower earlier, and this earlier flowering tends to be associated with an increase in aphid numbers.  To understand what is causing this association, the researchers will experimentally alter snow cover as a way to vary the timing of plant-insect interactions.  This work is important because it adds to our understanding of how changes in the timing of when organisms interact with each other, affect food webs, and the resulting ecological communities. The results will have implications for predicting the abundance of insect herbivores in natural and agricultural systems affected by an earlier arrival of spring. This project will also provide undergraduate students from under-served communities with training in field ecology, and will develop learning opportunities for K-12 teachers and students.<br/><br/>Using a combination of observational and experimental approaches, this research will determine the direct and indirect effects of changes in plant phenology on herbivore abundance.  In this study system, aphids (Aphis helianthi) colonize the inflorescences of their host plant (Ligusticum porteri), and six years of monitoring indicates that advances in host-plant phenology (earlier flowering) are associated with increases in the abundance of aphids. This correlation between plant phenology and the abundance of herbivores may be due to the direct effects of phenology on plant nutritional quality and/or to the indirect mediation of interactions among ants, predators and competitors. This study will apply a structural equation modeling approach to evaluate hypotheses about how phenological cues influence arthropod abundance through these direct and indirect trophic interactions. The study will directly vary host plant phenology through the experimental manipulation of snow melt using plant populations found along an elevational gradient. These experiments will also employ a factorial design to combine plant phenology treatments with treatments that alter the accessibility of aphid colonies to their mutualists and/or predators.  Differences in aphid colony growth among treatments will show the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects of plant stage.  Laboratory assays of phloem sap and aphid quality (e.g., C/N ratio, secondary metabolite content etc.) will complement these field experiments and provide a mechanism by which host plant phenology could affect aphid population growth or the ant-aphid mutualism."

This project takes advantage of two pine tree-feeding insect pests that are ""caught in the act"" of species formation. Although there are many differences between them, the redheaded-pine sawfly and the white-pine sawfly interbreed at low levels in nature. This suggests that species formation is not quite complete. Adaptation to different pines appears to be a key factor that reduces gene exchange between these species. Laboratory crosses and field experiments will be used to identify the genetic regions responsible for different pine adaptations. The results should reveal how these differences affect rates of gene exchange between these species in the wild.

This study will inform regional natural resource managers of climate effects and develop activities for students from Albuquerque-area and San Marcos, TX schools through STEM focused K-12 education programs at both institutions. <br/><br/>The project will test the overarching hypothesis that tree density in semi-arid biomes may represent a tipping point, such that a decrease in tree density due to drought-induced mortality can trigger a potentially irreversible drying of the system, and transition to a new ecosystem state.  The project will address: 1) specific mechanisms that explain why plant-available soil moisture and remaining juniper and small pion pine tree function decreases following pion mortality (decrease of hydraulic redistribution, altered energy balance, or reduced infiltration due to hydrophobic litter inputs); and which process, if any, is dominant; 2) if there are specific tree density thresholds or species-specific community compositions that facilitate aridification following tree mortality; 3) if there are soil structure and/or precipitation regimes in semi-arid woodlands that facilitate aridification following tree mortality and 4) what is the likelihood that these disturbed woodlands will return to their previous state or progress to a new ecosystem state. The experimental design is centered on nine large plots, three with no disturbance that will act as controls, three in which all pion pines are girdled, and three in which all juniper are girdled, which will allow the research team to examine species-specific roles of pion and juniper in regulating the hydrology of these woodlands. Measurements include the response of hydraulic redistribution and sapflow in the remaining species, soil moisture profiles, and surface energy balance components, which will be used to constrain a land surface model, the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5), modified to include hydraulic redistribution. The proposed work will greatly enhance the ability to predict how and why coniferous mortality in semi-arid biomes may trigger aridification, advance our understanding of the links between tree mortality and hydrology in semi-arid systems, and quantify the role of hydraulic distribution at the ecosystem scale."

This is certainly true of mosses, which are small plants that can quickly absorb water from rainfall or fog mist, and then gradually release the water back to their environment, thus moderating water flow, preventing soil erosion, and assisting in preventing landslides and flooding down mountain slopes. Mosses are believe to play an especially vital role in the mountain forests and the alpine regions throughout the Andean ecosystems of South America. The tropical Andes represent one of the world's most species diverse regions for mosses, but is also where degradation and fragmentation of the natural landscape, coupled with rapid melting of glaciers, is having a major impact on ecosystems.  Identifying and describing the diversity of species of mosses is critical in order to understand their ecological roles and ensure their conservation in the natural environment. This project will provide documentation and summary of the more than 1400 moss species for the highly diverse, Andean mountain ecosystems. Descriptive text and data based collections, accompanied by maps, photographs and illustrations will be made accessible through a project webpage to the scientific community and general public. Products include a complete taxonomic description of all Andean mosses, as well as illustrated on-line guides to these poorly studied but important organisms. Through workshops and direct collaborations, this project will strengthen scientific connections between U.S. and South American scientists and provide international research experiences to U.S. graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Based on 30 years of fieldwork and investigations by the principal investigator, this project will provide a thorough taxonomic treatment of all families, genera, and species of Andean mosses accompanied by detailed information on their ecology, geographical distribution and observations. The project will also produce interactive identification keys to all 69 families and 345 genera generated from a character state list accompanied by corresponding illustrations. The principal investigator will complete species<br/>Illustrations previously prepared in draft form, with the objective of having two thirds of all species illustrated, and produce new illustrative plates to provide defining morphological traits of medium and large families and genera.  Precise estimates of species diversity for most major groups of organisms has been elusive for the tropical Andes. This project will provide a complete account of the tropical Andean mosses, providing new knowledge on up to 500 species that are currently undescribed or undiscovered."

A popular idea is that predators control disease outbreaks by killing infected prey which are weaker and thereby easier to capture. However, this proposal warns that predators may sometimes spread disease in host populations. The researchers will use organisms living in lakes to test five ways in which predators could spread disease. These ideas are that predators: (1) while eating prey, physically spread parasites into prey habitat; (2) can increase food supply for prey, and more food can cause higher parasite production within infected hosts; (3) can shift the composition of prey populations towards certain ages and sizes that get infected more easily; (4) can kill other species that control disease; and (5) can cause genetic changes to prey populations, making them more susceptible to disease organisms. The project will focus on water fleas (the hosts), a deadly fungal parasite, and an insect predator to test these possibilities. The research uses these organisms as a model system: outbreaks of this fungus can be sampled in lakes, created in experiments within lakes and in the lab, and can be understood using mathematical models. These new ideas, once tested thoroughly in the lab and verified in nature, will help managers make prudent decisions on how to control disease outbreaks in wild and domestic animal populations. The project will train many students, and focus on engaging those in underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This project integrates three approaches. First, it will invest in a survey of fungal epidemics in water flea hosts in 40 lakes. The data from this large survey will be used to generate complex statistical models that test the first four mechanisms (ideas) given above. Second, it uses controlled experiments. One experiment will test mechanisms (2)-(4) with factorial manipulation of predatory insects and ""competitor-diluters"" (other water flea species which eat parasite propagules). A second experiment will investigate details of mechanisms (1)-(3). A third experiment investigates a tradeoff among clonal genotypes of the host; genotypes which better escape predation are more vulnerable to parasites. The hypothesis is that predators will shift host populations, via rapid evolution, towards bigger epidemics via this tradeoff. Third, this project develops a new suite of parameterized, mathematical (dynamical) models, designed to evaluate each of the mechanisms separately and together."

Such advances will enable a better understanding of human interactions with nature and improve our ability to forecast how environmental change will affect services provided by natural and agricultural ecosystems in the future. To reach these goals, this project will synthesize three decades of the principle investigator's and his close colleagues' research into a predictive theory of the way ecosystems with many species are organized and how they change over time. The core of this theory is based on organisms' abilities to consume resources, grow, and be consumed by other organisms as well as the network architecture of these consumer-resource interactions among tens, hundreds and thousands of species. Elements of this general theory have been published in over one hundred papers, most of which are sole or co-authored by this project's principle investigator. How the ideas in all these papers fit together, including the theory, its foundations, and future directions have yet to be adequately synthesized and articulated. This project will describe that synthetic framework in the form of a book, a review article, visualizations and video animations that define the concepts, equations and computer simulations underlying the theory. This research will also increase the accessibility of ecological network theory to broader audiences, and advance the careers of researchers who are members of groups underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This project will synthesize theory focused on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of food webs and their bipartite subsets including mutualistic and host-parasite/pathogen networks based on integrating consumer-resource theory with network theory and the metabolic theory of ecology. This involves describing the conceptual and computational theory of allometric trophic networks and its application to ecological, evolutionary and sustainability sciences including predictions of the quantitative consequences of species loss, fishing, and climate change. Further development aims to advance a systems biology of ecology that synthesizes ecology by integrating its subdisciplines, especially organismal, population, community and ecosystem ecology, as well as the interface between ecology and evolutionary, social, sustainability, and network sciences. Benefits to society include increasing our understanding of ecosystem management and eco-evolutionary and coupled natural-human dynamics. Two years of research and writing will be conducted involving collaborative visits to international and domestic centers of network and ecological network research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After analysis of the survey's results, a larger group of scientists and representatives from professional organizations will meet to reach consensus on the most important obstacles to students pursuing careers in ecology and evolutionary biology, and to propose new ways of assisting those students.  This work is important because advancement of science depends on a diverse workforce to provide novel ideas that would remain undiscovered if all scientists had similar backgrounds.<br/><br/>Previous research to understand the low participation of blacks in ecology and evolutionary biology suggests they have higher levels of religiosity than other underrepresented groups and that their reluctance may also hinge on misconceptions about evolution. The principal investigators (PIs) of this project hypothesize that lack of role models, lack of experience working in the outdoors, and cultural factors (e.g., religious beliefs, values) are barriers to inclusion, lowering blacks' sense of identity and belonging in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology.  To test this hypothesis, the PIs have developed a survey to assess the roles these factors play in shaping attitudes of undergraduate students to careers in different disciplines of science.  Participants at a small initial workshop will rigorously review and assess the efficacy of the survey.  After revisions are made, the survey will be administered to a large and diverse sample of students.  Participants at a second workshop will review the results of survey and consider their implications for broadening participation in careers of science, with an emphasis on blacks and the disciplines of ecology and evolutionary biology."

By combining the evolutionary process with robotic engineering, more complex and novel designs should be possible compared to traditional methods.  In spite of the promise, so far evolved robots only do simple things like walk, navigate, or pick up objects. What limits progress is a lack of understanding of ""evolvability,"" the capacity of organisms (or robots) to change and become more complex.  Understanding evolvability is the main goal of this project: researchers will borrow ideas from modern genetics so their robots mutate and develop in ways that are similar to how biological creatures do.

By linking complexity, genetics, and evolution, this project seeks to discover new principles that can be applied in science and industry.  To help convert scientific principles into innovation drivers, online software will be created to show how to evolve virtual or physical robots; this will help students learn about engineering, biology, and how to apply both to technology.  Finally, evolutionary robotics can be used to solve complex problems in robotic control that defy logical programming solutions, so this research can help companies that manufacture robots."

The application of ecological knowledge to improve sustainable agricultural ecosystems remains a recognized grand challenge for environmental science.  Since 1988, research at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) LTER has addressed this challenge for row-crop ecosystems and landscapes, by seeking to understand the fundamental ecological underpinnings of these highly managed ecosystems and to reveal ways that ecological knowledge can enhance the long-term sustainability of production agriculture. This renewal award builds on past work to launch an effort to better understand the long-term stability of key ecosystem services afforded by agriculture, with an emphasis on three major drivers: climate change, changes in the science of land management for crop production, and invasive species.  Proposed research bears directly on agricultural and environmental management and policies at scales ranging from local to global. The study of agricultural systems also informs ecology because few other ecosystems have such a degree of simplification and control of major environmental drivers.  Training graduate students and postdocs is an important component of this project, as is providing research experiences for undergraduates. KBS scientists also will continue to work with K-12 science teachers through an established partnership with 11 nearby school districts. Outreach and extension activities will reach a broad community of stakeholders, and will include a new emphasis on farmers and those who influence farmer decisions.<br/><br/>The major scientific foci of the KBS LTER are vulnerability and resilience of cropping systems to drivers of change, and how ecological theory can help design more sustainable crop production.  Two overarching questions motivate the research: 1) How do changing environmental drivers affect the resilience of key ecosystem services including crop yield and profitability as well as environmental and socioecological benefits, and 2) To what extent can ecological knowledge help maintain the robust and reliable delivery of these services?  Key ecosystem services include crop yield but also extend more broadly to climate stabilization (greenhouse gas emissions), water quality (eutrophication), pest suppression (insect herbivory and predation), and soil fertility (plant-microbe-soil interactions).  Knowledge gaps identified from research to date will be addressed with new research lines that include rainfall manipulation experiments, watershed observations, and examinations of rapid evolution of plant-microorganism associations, predator-prey dynamics newly influenced by invasive species and novel pesticides, and long-term changes in farmer attitudes and behaviors."

This research will focus on an insect group that contains species with a wide range of habitats from open waters to terrestrial leaf litter. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of this lineage, the researchers will examine when, where, and how it has evolved across the aquatic-terrestrial boundary, and use the group as a model to understand how other organisms may have undergone major habitat shifts. Understanding how insects undergo major ecological transitions and what implications these transitions have can improve our understanding of how animals respond to changing climates and altered environments. The broader impacts of this research include the training of two PhD students in the biodiversity sciences. A new undergraduate course in biodiversity monitoring and assessment will be developed to teach the theory, methods, and practice of measuring species richness and turnover over geographic distances. This course will include fieldwork in Suriname and Guyana in conjunction with host country institutions.  <br/><br/>This research will use water scavenger beetles (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae), a lineage that encompasses many independent transitions between aquatic and terrestrial niches, as a model to examine habitat shifts at multiple evolutionary scales: clades, species, and populations. Researchers will (1) infer a 500-species molecular phylogeny to identify the number, timing, and placement of habitat shifts and test for associated changes in diversification rate between habitat types, (2) examine the fine-scale morphological evolution associated with changing habitats through a species-level taxonomic revision of the Chasmogenus-group, including the description of approximately 50 new species, coupled with a morphological-molecular phylogeny, and (3) disentangle habitat-associated from lineage-specific effects on co-distributed populations by using RAD-seq methods to examine the genetic structure of 12 species with diverse ecological niches across three independent clades.

The research employs the latest high-tech lightning sensors in combination with digital video cameras to record and precisely locate cloud-to-ground lightning flashes over approximately 20 square km of forest canopy in real time. The central hypothesis is that lightning is a major agent of tropical tree and liana mortality, and thereby plays an important role in carbon cycling and plant-feeding insect distributions. The work will integrate information from field ecology, remote sensing, atmospheric science, and physics to answer three basic questions: 1) What factors affect the probability of lightning strikes to tropical trees?; 2) What is the amount of carbon in the form of dead wood produced by lightning on a forest-wide scale?; and 3) Does the distribution of lightning damage affect canopy insect distributions? This work will improve knowledge of tropical forest dynamics by measuring the effects on lightning on different forest components across the landscape. Specifically, it will uncover key interactions among lightning, lianas, trees, and insects. As a whole, the project will provide the first accurate measure of lightning distribution, frequency, and biological effects in a tropical forest."

Finally, this project includes a collaboration with the Director of Education at the Kentucky Science Center, who will produce museum displays highlighting this research, and will organize public discussions with project participants in an informal Science Caf setting. <br/><br/>The principal objective of this study is to quantify the ecological effects of lightning on trees and lianas (woody vines) in a lowland tropical forest. The research employs the latest high-tech lightning sensors in combination with digital video cameras to record and precisely locate cloud-to-ground lightning flashes over approximately 20 square km of forest canopy in real time. The central hypothesis is that lightning is a major agent of tropical tree and liana mortality, and thereby plays an important role in carbon cycling and plant-feeding insect distributions. The work will integrate information from field ecology, remote sensing, atmospheric science, and physics to answer three basic questions: 1) What factors affect the probability of lightning strikes to tropical trees?; 2) What is the amount of carbon in the form of dead wood produced by lightning on a forest-wide scale?; and 3) Does the distribution of lightning damage affect canopy insect distributions? This work will improve knowledge of tropical forest dynamics by measuring the effects on lightning on different forest components across the landscape. Specifically, it will uncover key interactions among lightning, lianas, trees, and insects. As a whole, the project will provide the first accurate measure of lightning distribution, frequency, and biological effects in a tropical forest."

This Research Coordination Project will create an interdisciplinary network of scientists, decision makers and other stakeholders to synthesize existing information, and produce science products to understand and advance sustainable land-use trajectories. The major activities will be to: generate a suite of qualitative land-use scenarios co-developed with stakeholders that depict a range of possible future social, economic, and environmental realities for the New England region of the United States; simulate the land-use scenarios as they interact with multiple environmental stressors using existing modeling frameworks; evaluate these scenarios in terms of ecosystem services that are defined together with the stakeholders; and share knowledge with the broader public and decision makers to advance sustainable land-use trajectories.<br/><br/>This project will integrate multiple broader impacts throughout its five-year duration. By including post-docs and students at all levels as participants in the network, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development by offering direct experience in managing collaborative, interdisciplinary research networks.  The network will also provide training for scientists of all ranks in techniques of stakeholder engagement, linking science with action, and science communication.  This project will sponsor regional workshops for developing stakeholder-defined land use scenarios and for linking these to practical solutions that can be put into action."

The discovery of these vents in 1977 revealed unexpectedly novel and diverse organisms, challenging the prevailing view of the deep sea as a sparsely populated desert. Recent international efforts to mine hydrothermal vent deposits rich in copper, gold, silver and zinc are intensely debated, as deep-sea mineral mining can destroy diverse vent communities and alter the surrounding seafloor habitat. The investigators will extend their models to analyze the potential effects of mining activities. Results from new models will be synthesized to meet the needs of potential stakeholders, including organizations that advise, manage, and conduct activities related to seafloor mining and Marine Protected Areas. Research products will be disseminated as reports and in stakeholder meetings such as those organized by the International Seabed Authority and the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative. The research team will work with graphic artists, video producers, and educators to develop new educational presentations for the NOAA Science on a Sphere (SOS) system. This new content will be distributed via open access to the entire SOS Users Network and incorporated into SOS programs at over 100 science centers across the U.S. and in 20 other countries. Undergraduate students will participate in the project through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Summer Student Fellowship Program and the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program.

The options for modeling dispersal properties with two alternative dispersal kernels will also advance understanding. The researchers will examine recognized successional patterns not considered in the previous work using patch occupancy models, and they will carry out sensitivity analyses to evaluate the role of parameters for which uncertainty is high, such as larval duration and dispersal distance, patch disturbance rates and recovery times.

While twenty percent of the world population lives in river basins fed by melt waters from snow or glaciers, we know very little about how changes in snowpack and temperature in high mountain areas will affect biodiversity conservation or the management of water resources. Ecosystem responses to increasing temperature occur over many years to many decades, so long-term observations and long-term experiments are required to detect and understand those responses. The NWT LTER research provides an important reference point for regional, national, and global networks to measure changes in the water cycle and life at high elevations. The mountainous lands associated with NWT provides a natural laboratory in which to explore why some habitats may be very sensitive to changes in the environment while other areas may not be sensitive. The natural setting of NWT also provides many features that can help promote and develop an interest in science and nature, and inspire schoolchildren and the public to learn about the ecology of mountains and the tundra.<br/><br/>The NWT LTER program builds on over 35 years of long-term measurements and experiments to better understand where and when climate change results in ecological change, and to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to responsiveness or stability in ecological systems. Specific objectives include (a) using long-term observations to characterize how high-mountain environments are responding to climate, (b) using long-term experiments to test hypotheses about the underlying drivers and integration among these responses, and (c) integrating this information in modeling frameworks to both refine understanding and forecast responses to future change. The research is conceptually organized around how climate change translates to ecological response across a spatially complex landscape and across ecological levels of organization. Proposed questions derive from theory on climate exposure in complex terrain and compensatory dynamics, and the long-term observations and interdisciplinary expertise at NWT allow comprehensive tests of these theories. Specific investigations are framed by substantial variation in ecological responses to long-term trends in climate at NWT involving warmer spring and summer temperatures, earlier snowmelt and lake ice-off, and longer growing seasons. Research will focus on treeline and subalpine forest, and alpine and subalpine lakes, and alpine tundra ecosystems. Outreach and training addresses a broad range of audiences, including K-12 students, the general public, and citizen scientists, while emphasizing training of graduate students in science communication and engaged scholarship."

These attributes make wetlands a significant environmental, recreational, and economic resource for our nation. In freshwater wetlands, tall plants emerging from the water, such as cattails, often account for a large fraction of the plant matter produced. These plants exhibit prolific rates of growth and absorb large amounts of nutrient contaminants, improving water quality in the process. Most of this plant matter is not directly consumed by animals, but instead dies and is decomposed by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). During decomposition, nutrients trapped within plant tissues may be released via the activity of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Bacteria and fungi growing on decaying plants also serve as a key food resource for many invertebrate animals, and form a link in the flow of energy and nutrients up the food chain (to fish and waterfowl, for example) in wetland habitats. As a consequence, the productivity, nutrient uptake, and decomposition of emergent plants will profoundly affect nearly all aspects of wetland function. This research project will measure the importance of bacteria and fungi in wetland plant decay, and investigate how their potential interactions with algae affect rates of plant matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Microorganisms are key players in the circulation of nutrients on Earth. This circulation, often referred to as biogeochemical cycling, includes all of the biological, geological and chemical factors that are involved. Understanding the ecology of microorganisms is essential for us to meet the major challenges facing human society, such as conservation and management of natural ecosystems and mitigation of climate change. In addition to training a postdoctoral scholar, this research will train undergraduate and graduate students through a collaborative, multifaceted effort to understand a key ecosystem process, decomposition. Through these efforts researchers will also participate in a series of existing university programs and coordinated outreach activities aimed at recruiting underrepresented groups into the sciences and strengthening science education at the elementary through university levels.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand the nature of metabolic interactions among algae, bacteria, and fungi in decomposing plant litter, and to quantify how these interactions influence plant litter decomposition and carbon cycling in wetlands.  Photolysis of dissolved and particulate organic matter is widely accepted as an important abiotic decomposition process in aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, enhanced decomposition via algal stimulation of litter-associated heterotrophic microbes has only recently been considered. Prior research by this team has documented rapid metabolic responses of heterotrophic microbes to algal photosynthesis in natural decaying plant litter, thus establishing the potential for algal ""priming effects"" on microbial-mediated litter decomposition, yet, the relative importance of algal priming and photolysis in facilitating litter decomposition in aquatic ecosystems remains unknown. This project will involve a series of field and laboratory experiments in marsh ecosystems, investigating three key questions centered on photostimulation of litter decomposition: 1) What is the relative importance of algal photosynthetic priming vs. photolysis in facilitating microbial-mediated organic matter decomposition? 2) What is the influence of photolysis and autotroph-heterotroph interactions on ecosystem-scale carbon cycling"" 3) What are the mechanisms mediating autotroph-heterotroph interactions in decaying plant litter?"

It will also greatly increase basic knowledge of how plants cope with different environments and how they interact with insects that pollinate their flowers and eat their leaves. Many undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups in science, will participate in the project, gaining research experience and career training. The team will work to increase international capacity in biodiversity science by helping with field courses in Latin America, involving local research assistants at each tropical field site, and organizing an international research symposium in Costa Rica.  Finally, investigators will broadly communicate their experiences and scientific findings to the general public.  Results will help guide conservation and management of tropical forests, which are rapidly changing due to human influences.<br/><br/>Two evolutionary hypotheses for high tropical speciation rates have been proposed. First, because tropical climates are relatively stable year-round, organisms may not evolve the ability to tolerate a wide range of climates and therefore may not disperse widely. Local populations will then become isolated from their relatives and gradually become new species. Alternatively, interactions between plants and other organisms, such as pollinators and herbivores, may vary from place to place, such that a population adapted to one biological community will grow and reproduce poorly when it spreads to another community. In this way, there may be natural selection for plants in different locations to become different species. This research uses spiral gingers in the monocot genus Costus in Costa Rica and Panama to test these hypotheses about tropical speciation. Spiral gingers occupy a wide range of habitats, extending from lowlands to montane forests and from dense understory to forest edges, with different temperature, water, and soil conditions. They interact with many different orchid bee and hummingbird pollinators, highly specialized beetles that feed on young leaves, and ants that provide protection from herbivores in exchange for nectar. This work integrates phylogenetic studies, broad scale observational approaches, focused field experiments (reciprocal transplants and direct manipulations of interacting organisms and abiotic factors), and genetic mapping. It will determine how plants interact with and adapt to pollinators, herbivores, ant protectors, and climatic conditions across their geographic ranges. It will evaluate whether speciation is caused by traits and genes that have positive effects in one environment and negative effects in other environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even in younger forests, strong wind events, insect outbreaks, fire and forest management all can result in accumulation of dead wood.  Dead wood stores carbon, but how much in the long-term is uncertain.  Much of the carbon in wood is slowly returned to the atmosphere as CO2 during decomposition. Some, however, also enters the soil, where it can be stored for decades to centuries.  In 2011, pine, aspen and birch logs were placed in nine forests across the U.S. to help determine how factors such as climate, wood type, presence of termites and fungi affect wood decomposition rate.  The wood used had a unique carbon isotopic signature that allows the research team to trace it as it enters the soil, and to measure how fast carbon is either lost to decomposition or stored as soil carbon. This knowledge will improve understanding of carbon cycling in forests and allow better prediction of how a changing climate or increased tree death from forest disturbance could alter carbon storage in forests. This research will help to determine if forests will be carbon sinks or sources for atmospheric CO2 over long time scales. The project will also give middle and high school students a chance to experience scientific research first-hand, and increase awareness of STEM topics in rural schools near four of the research sites. Project scientists will work with teachers to involve students in research-based discovery and analysis at a nearby field site and incorporate project topics related to ecology and soil science in school curricula, providing a foundation for increasing student interest in science and engineering careers.<br/><br/>The fungal and invertebrate communities that dominate wood decomposition have distinct lignin and carbohydrate decomposition pathways along a white- to brown-rot continuum, and these alter the amount of carbon diverted to the mineral soil.

It influences how DNA is inherited from one generation to the next. Organisms actually have many different ways of reproducing.  It is unclear why the most common should involve genetic contributions from two parents (bi-parental reproduction) as opposed to one (uni-parental reproduction). One important consequence of bi-parental reproduction is that it produces more genetically variable offspring.  Why this is an advantage, however, is unclear.  One possibility is that genetically variable offspring are more likely to escape infection from parasites and diseases that have adapted to the parents' genetic make-up. Another is that the genetic variability is helpful more generally for adaptation to changing environments. This project uses the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which can reproduce either uni- or bi-parentally, along with its bacterial parasite, Serratia marcescens, to experimentally test these ideas.  The project will also contribute to teaching and training students at many levels, providing opportunities for them to learn scientific methods in a hands-on fashion. It will integrate research with education in undergraduate teaching labs and will include developing and implementing new teaching laboratory classes. It will also train graduate students. Finally, it will include an outreach program that will bring hypothesis testing science to a neighborhood with many young children from underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>The questions of both how and why bi-parental reproduction is maintained in nature largely remain a mystery in evolutionary biology. Currently, the Red Queen hypothesis (RQH) is the most well supported hypothesis regarding the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing. The central prediction of the RQH is that negative frequency-dependent selection, imposed by coevolving parasites, favors reproduction via outcrossing over self-fertilization in host populations. Although a rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the ability of coevolving parasites to favor host outcrossing over host self-fertilization, the mode of selection imposed by coevolving parasites, and in general, the coevolutionary dynamics between outcrossing hosts and their respective parasites remain unclear. Here, the fundamental predictions of the RQH will be comprehensively tested in perhaps the only experimental system currently capable of permitting such a test. Specifically, the host, Caenorhabditis elegans, and parasite, Serratia marcescens, populations will be experimentally evolved to determine if coevolving parasites are necessary for the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing, or if only a dynamic changing environment is required. After which, the phenotypic and underlying genetic changes in the hosts and parasites, as well as the mode (or modes) of selection that result from antagonistic coevolution, will be determined through a combination of phenotypic assays, next-generation sequencing, functional genetic testing via transformation, and subsequent experimental evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will work to increase international capacity in biodiversity science by helping with field courses in Latin America, involving local research assistants at each tropical field site, and organizing an international research symposium in Costa Rica.  Finally, investigators will broadly communicate their experiences and scientific findings to the general public.  Results will help guide conservation and management of tropical forests, which are rapidly changing due to human influences.<br/><br/>Two evolutionary hypotheses for high tropical speciation rates have been proposed. First, because tropical climates are relatively stable year-round, organisms may not evolve the ability to tolerate a wide range of climates and therefore may not disperse widely. Local populations will then become isolated from their relatives and gradually become new species. Alternatively, interactions between plants and other organisms, such as pollinators and herbivores, may vary from place to place, such that a population adapted to one biological community will grow and reproduce poorly when it spreads to another community. In this way, there may be natural selection for plants in different locations to become different species. This research uses spiral gingers in the monocot genus Costus in Costa Rica and Panama to test these hypotheses about tropical speciation. Spiral gingers occupy a wide range of habitats, extending from lowlands to montane forests and from dense understory to forest edges, with different temperature, water, and soil conditions. They interact with many different orchid bee and hummingbird pollinators, highly specialized beetles that feed on young leaves, and ants that provide protection from herbivores in exchange for nectar. This work integrates phylogenetic studies, broad scale observational approaches, focused field experiments (reciprocal transplants and direct manipulations of interacting organisms and abiotic factors), and genetic mapping. It will determine how plants interact with and adapt to pollinators, herbivores, ant protectors, and climatic conditions across their geographic ranges. It will evaluate whether speciation is caused by traits and genes that have positive effects in one environment and negative effects in other environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our current understanding of the factors that control belowground carbon allocation is significantly weaker than aboveground allocation. Yet, in grasslands the amount of carbon that goes belowground each year is much larger than the amount of carbon allocated aboveground. Our rudimentary understanding of the controls of belowground carbon allocation and the ratio of aboveground to belowground carbon is a significant knowledge gap, as roots are a major input of organic material and nutrients into soil. Predictions of future carbon storage in these ecosystems hinge on our understanding of the effects of environmental availability on allocation of carbon belowground. This study addresses the questions: How does precipitation affect the above/belowground partitioning of carbon?  During drought periods, are above and belowground structures equally affected, or are roots affected less than leaves and branches?  Finally, is the effect of precipitation on carbon allocation constant or does it vary from deserts to humid grasslands?  This project will install experiments in New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas to understand the effect of precipitation on the partitioning of carbon above versus belowground and the underlying mechanisms.<br/><br/>This proposal presents three novel hypotheses based on: (1) a plant-response mechanism, suggesting decreased belowground allocation with increasing water availability, and (2) a trophic-cascade mechanism, suggesting the opposite pattern derived from the differential sensitivity of root feeders and their predators to water availability. A final hypothesis (3) suggests that the magnitude of plant responses decreases from arid to humid grasslands while the magnitude of the trophic-cascade phenomenon increases. The trophic-cascade mechanism may be constrained by the abundance of belowground predators in arid grasslands, which is greater in humid ecosystems. The experimental design includes complementary field and microcosm experiments located in three different ecosystem types: Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, NM, Shortgrass Steppe, CO, and Tallgrass Prairie, KS. The field experiment includes additions and reductions of precipitation at each site. The microcosm experiment is based on monoliths subjected to 4 soil fauna treatments x 5 water manipulations. Soil fauna treatments consist of (1) soil devoid of fauna (just native bacteria and fungi), (2) defaunated soil inoculated with nematode root feeders, (3) defaunated soil inoculated with nematode root feeders and nematode predators, and (4) control.  Microcosm tubes will be located in each of the water manipulation plots using individuals of the dominant grass species of each ecosystem type. This project will train a post-doctoral fellow and graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. Collaboration with the Asombro Institute for Science Education, a non-profit organization that provides award-winning science education to more than 12,000 children and 4,500 adults annually in southern New Mexico and western Texas, will include establishing a demonstration project of a soil-observation window at the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park. Partnerships with the ""Ask A Biologist"" program will result in an article on the interactions between plants and belowground organisms and how these interactions are modulated by water availability. The project will contribute special events associated with the effects of climate on belowground processes during a summer sustainability program that engages local teachers and students, and the ""Managing the Planet"" series aimed at the general public."

They are also especially vulnerable to human pressures and environmental change. Wetlands contain large reservoirs of soil organic matter, an important source of carbon and nitrogen to estuaries and coastal oceans, but very little is known about the processes involved in the translocation of these nutrients. This project will advance understanding of tidal marsh-estuarine interactions by linking processes between tidal wetland soils and estuaries, and assessing where, when, and how dissolved organic compounds are retained, released and transformed within the marsh soil-estuarine system. Results from this study will be integrated into enhanced monitoring and management efforts through partnerships with the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The project will improve models that predict the influence of wetlands on estuarine and coastal biology,  geochemistry and pollution response.  In collaboration with the Smithsonian Citizen Science program and teachers from middle schools serving minority students, the team will develop K-12 educational materials.  Specialized training will be extended to undergraduate students, as well as graduate and postdoctoral researchers, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>This study will test three key research hypotheses that are critical for understanding the role of marsh soils and tidal wetland-estuary margins as buffers, reactors, and transformers of dissolved organic C and N, and that could transform our ability to predict the influence of wetland ecosystems on estuarine biology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. An integrative approach will be used to test hypotheses that combines rich datasets, process-focused experiments, and a novel coupled hydrodynamic-photo-biogeochemical model to investigate three understudied aspects of marsh export that likely control the seasonality and fate of dissolved organic matter in estuaries: (i) soil and porewater organic matter composition, (ii) adsorption-desorption on soil surfaces, and iii) photo- and bio- degradation in estuarine waters. Proposed activities incorporate a system perspective and cover a broad range of marsh environments (i.e., different marsh vegetation characteristics, soil type, surface area and salinity regimes) providing the ability to scale up and assess tidal marsh biogeochemical fluxes and processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results from this research will increase understanding of the contributions of wetlands and estuarine systems to coastal carbon and nitrogen budgets, and improve predictions of the influences of natural and man-made stresses on ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and exchanges along the continuum of wetlands, estuaries and the coastal zone. This information is highly valuable to managing the coastal zone in the face of accelerated environmental change and continued human pressures and, in particular, to evaluating the potential for managed restoration of wetlands to mitigate climate change impacts."

Flowering plants rapidly diversified and spread around the globe and evolved a variety of life forms that added to the ecological complexity of forests. This project investigates a crucial interval of this transition, ~75 million years ago, by studying a series of exceptionally preserved fossil floras from southern New Mexico, which existed under a wet tropical paleoclimate. These studies will provide important insights into forest evolution in tropical climates, the timing and patterns of ecological expansion of flowering plants, the habitats of dinosaurs and early mammals, and the history of vegetation for the western interior of North America. Most of these plant fossils collected this research represent species new to science and can provide important historical records for living lineages. The project provides training for students from diverse backgrounds. It also has several major initiatives for education and public outreach, including the development, testing, and dissemination of lesson plans for science teachers about the rise of flowering plants and modern forests. <br/><br/>This project will use extensive paleontological field studies, fossil collections, and new quantitative techniques to generate extensive reconstructions of late Campanian forests from fossilized leaves, wood, seeds and fruits. By using newly developed sampling and analytical techniques, these studies will generate reconstructions of the diversity and ecological structure of the paleo forests. The fossil floras are from the Jose Creek Member of the McRae Formation in south-central New Mexico, which was located >200 km inland of the Western Interior Seaway. The diversity and community structure of the fossil forests will be reconstructed using spatial distributions of plant species across the landscape, while the functional ecology of the plants will be reconstructed by measuring traits of leaves, wood, and seeds/fruits that are reflective of life form, physiology, growth rate, and reproductive strategy. This information, when combined with analyses of climatically similar Cretaceous, Cenozoic, and extant floras, will be used to test hypotheses about: 1) the community structure and roles of major clades in Campanian floras; 2) the functional ecology of Cretaceous angiosperms; and 3) how the ecological structure of forests has changed through time in warm-wet climates. The functional trait-based approach used will link extant and paleo-ecology, and have broad applicability to understanding ecological radiations and community turnover following key evolutionary innovations."

Understanding its future depends on understanding biological processes at the molecular level, including the movement of genes, adaptations to disease and drought, and other heritable changes, interact in a changing environment interact to govern its overall success. But in addition, sustainability of SWP is threatened by a non-native tree disease called white pine blister rust.

The approach will also provide a prototype for forecasting complex system behavior that is more generally applicable.<br/><br/>The results of this project will contribute to the conservation of SWP and the ecosystems in which it occurs. White pine blister rust causes widespread tree decline and mortality in western North America, including the rapidly expanding area where it overlaps with SWP. It is quite possible that the climate will change too rapidly for SWP to adapt, causing widespread tree death and potential extinction. To help reach its goals, this project will also involve a number of educational and outreach activities, including exhibits and real common garden plantings at Flagstaff Arboretum in Arizona and the U.S. Forest Service Dorena Genetic Resource Center in Cottage Grove, Oregon. A number of postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in interdisciplinary science that bridges genomics, tree disease resistance testing, landscape ecology, modeling, engineering, remote sensing, and spatial analysis.

They have evolved independently in a wide array of species, and while these chromosomes in different groups share many similarities, they also exhibit important differences. Explaining these differences, however, remains difficult. While a strong body of theoretical work makes several important predictions regarding the evolution of allosomes, conclusively testing those predictions has been difficult because most prior research has focused on a small subset of model organisms. This project will address this problem by examining allosomes in terrestrial isopod crustaceans, which include woodlice and pillbugs. Terrestrial isopods are an ideal group for these questions because they exhibit considerable variation in sex-determining mechanisms, but, surprisingly, their genomes have received little attention. The proposed experiments are designed to help explain why these chromosomes are so unique, and how they contribute to vital biological processes. Importantly, this project will also promote diversity in science and create hands-on educational opportunities for students, especially engaging those from under-served groups. First, a project-based genomics course will be developed, and course materials made publicly available. Second, an international summer program will be established that provides undergraduates at SUNY Oswego with opportunities to conduct research abroad. Finally, this work will generate interest in research on campus by allowing incoming freshmen participating in an existing science and math summer 'bridge' camp to take part in interdisciplinary laboratory activities.<br/><br/>This project will address key questions on the evolution of allosomes in three species of terrestrial isopod crustaceans (Trachelipus rathkei, Porcellio laevis, and Armadillidium vulgare).  This research will (i) identify where changes in sex-determining chromosomes have occurred on the isopod evolutionary tree; (ii) test whether genes on these chromosomes are affected more strongly than autosomal genes by natural selection and genetic drift; and (iii) test whether these species exhibit dosage compensation.  A comparative approach using whole genome sequencing and gene annotation via RNA sequencing will be used to address the first two aims. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) will also be used to determine homology of allosomes among species. The sex of terrestrial isopods can be experimentally manipulated through surgical ablation or implantation of androgenic glands, which offers a unique opportunity to accurately test for dosage compensation using RNA sequencing in manipulated and unmanipulated individuals of the same and opposite sex.  By studying a unique taxonomic group, this research will help examine the generality of patterns suggested by earlier work on allosomes, providing significant insights into these influential components of so many organisms' genomes, including those of humans."

Even in younger forests, strong wind events, insect outbreaks, fire and forest management all can result in accumulation of dead wood.  Dead wood stores carbon, but how much in the long-term is uncertain.  Much of the carbon in wood is slowly returned to the atmosphere as CO2 during decomposition. Some, however, also enters the soil, where it can be stored for decades to centuries.  In 2011, pine, aspen and birch logs were placed in nine forests across the U.S. to help determine how factors such as climate, wood type, presence of termites and fungi affect wood decomposition rate.  The wood used had a unique carbon isotopic signature that allows the research team to trace it as it enters the soil, and to measure how fast carbon is either lost to decomposition or stored as soil carbon. This knowledge will improve understanding of carbon cycling in forests and allow better prediction of how a changing climate or increased tree death from forest disturbance could alter carbon storage in forests. This research will help to determine if forests will be carbon sinks or sources for atmospheric CO2 over long time scales.

The vast majority of woody plant species - especially in the most diverse forests - depend on fruit-eating birds to disperse their seeds, but information on the factors governing fruit choice and seed dispersal at a community level is lacking. This project will address this shortcoming through observations and experiments across the Americas.  The overarching goal of the research is to test the hypothesis that fruit-eating birds of different sizes and classes increase dispersal rates for plant species that are proportionally rare in the environment. Achieving a better understanding of seed dispersal by birds is critically important to advancing ecology, since plant populations depend on seed dispersal to regenerate, coexist, colonize new areas, shift geographic ranges, and cope with climatic and other environmental changes. Beyond advancing basic science, the knowledge generated by this research will have positive implications for forestry, natural resource management, restoration ecology, and conservation. The activities will result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and broaden the education and participation of minorities in the sciences while fostering international collaboration and exchanges between researchers and students from the USA, Peru, and Argentina. <br/><br/>Existing theory and empirical work suggest that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms involving negative density-dependence (NDD) play key roles in the maintenance of species diversity by conferring advantages to species that are relatively rare in communities. This project will study a little known class of NDD process that, if proven to be of widespread occurrence, can be important for diversity maintenance and the structuring of plant-frugivore mutualistic communities: antiapostatic frugivory and seed dispersal. Antiapostatic frugivory would result in disproportionately high seed dispersal when species' fruits are relatively rare in communities of plants that share frugivorous seed dispersal agents such as birds. To examine the generality of antiapostatic frugivory, this research will conduct field studies in four continental localities representing four distinct plant-frugivore communities. These communities provide fully independent biotic and abiotic elements in which to test occurrence and magnitude of antiapostatic frugivory as they are located across a latitudinal gradient: from eastern North America (Pennsylvania) to southern South America (Patagonia), including two Peruvian forest sites (lowland Amazonian rainforest at Madre de Dios, and an Andean cloud forest at Abra Patricia). In addition to observations of fruit consumption and plant demography, controlled fruit-selection experiments using natural and artificial fruit displays will be conducted."

Toxic algal blooms occur when certain algal species become highly abundant and release toxins into the water that harm wildlife or humans. Although toxic blooms have been increasing in frequency and severity, our understanding of the factors that cause such species to either become highly abundant or to die back is still very limited. Most research has focused on how environmental factors, such as water pollution, affect bloom formation, but this explanation is inadequate in many cases. In the focal species certain genetic strains do not produce toxins; this study will test the unique hypothesis that large changes in Prymnesium population abundance result from the cooperation and competition among toxic and non-toxic genetic strains. In nature, many species exhibit cooperative behavior, even when it is not in the best interest of the cooperating individuals. Results from this work are expected to yield important insights into the evolution of cooperation and identify management strategies that can be used to control harmful algal blooms. In addition, the project will involve mentoring both undergraduate and high school students, including individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. Public lectures and a weekly radio science show are also planned.<br/><br/>Algal species that form harmful blooms produce toxins that often function allelopathically, by killing heterospecifics, decreasing interspecific competition and releasing nutrients into the water. In this way, these toxins appear to function as a 'public good' by benefiting the entire population. In Prymnesium parvum, a low-toxic 'cheater' strain has recently been isolated that has a significantly higher growth rate than toxic 'cooperator' strains both in monoculture and in mixed culture. This system offers a unique opportunity to investigate how ecological interactions may maintain cooperative allelopathy in unstructured populations. How can toxicity be maintained, if low-toxicity strains reap the benefits of toxicity while not contributing to toxin production? This question will be explored using a combination of laboratory microcosm experiments, strain culturing, and microscope observation. Specifically, mutual invasibility experiments will be used to look for intransitivity cycles between TOX+, TOX-, and a heterospecific strain in order to determine whether eco-evolutionary feedbacks lead to maintenance of toxic variation in this algal species."

Understanding its future depends on understanding biological processes at the molecular level, including the movement of genes, adaptations to disease and drought, and other heritable changes, interact in a changing environment interact to govern its overall success. But in addition, sustainability of SWP is threatened by a non-native tree disease called white pine blister rust. This project will develop tools to help forecast and manage the future of SWP, including genomic analyses, common garden trials where seedlings originating from different environments are planted together, screening for disease resistance, engineering and technology innovation to measure drought tolerance, and computer modeling that can integrate landscape ecology and genomics. The approach will also provide a prototype for forecasting complex system behavior that is more generally applicable.<br/><br/>The results of this project will contribute to the conservation of SWP and the ecosystems in which it occurs. White pine blister rust causes widespread tree decline and mortality in western North America, including the rapidly expanding area where it overlaps with SWP. It is quite possible that the climate will change too rapidly for SWP to adapt, causing widespread tree death and potential extinction. To help reach its goals, this project will also involve a number of educational and outreach activities, including exhibits and real common garden plantings at Flagstaff Arboretum in Arizona and the U.S. Forest Service Dorena Genetic Resource Center in Cottage Grove, Oregon. A number of postdoctoral scholars and graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in interdisciplinary science that bridges genomics, tree disease resistance testing, landscape ecology, modeling, engineering, remote sensing, and spatial analysis. An outreach website and content will be developed in English and Spanish to provide results to the public, including land managers. Postdoctoral researchers will collaborate on a workshop for students in Mexico as part of their training. Workshops will also be developed for conferences in the Southwest, one of which will be a major cross-border meeting between Mexican and U.S. foresters.

Nevertheless, there are few theoretical and empirical studies that a) simultaneously consider the impacts of these three processes on species interactions and distributions or b) investigate how the relative influence of these factors change across spatial and temporal scales. Host-parasite interactions are species interactions of particular concern because human and wildlife diseases are emerging at an unprecedented rate. Funds are being provided to address this knowledge gap using a theoretical framework to test how spatial and temporal scales affect host-parasite interactions. Spatially, abiotic factors, such as climate, might be most important at large spatial scales, but biotic and propagule pressure factors might be more important at small scales where climate is generally more homogeneous.  Temporally, unpredictable climatic shifts, which are increasing with global climate change, might increase infections because parasites should acclimate to temperature shifts more quickly than their hosts due to their smaller sizes and faster metabolisms.  The overall goal of this grant is to use a combination of experiments, modeling, and local-to-global analyses to test these and other hypotheses for how spatiotemporal scales affect host-parasite interactions and disease emergence.  Amphibian-parasite interactions will be the model study system because there are several spatiotemporally-explicit datasets on amphibian distributions, amphibian pathogen prevalence, and pathogen-driven amphibian declines and extinctions.  The specific objectives are to:<br/>A. Determine how the temporal scale of climatic shifts affects host-parasite interactions.<br/>B.

Over very long time periods, this diversity of plants is produced by speciation, the complicated process whereby one species becomes two. This project will test ideas about how speciation happens in tropical forests. It will also greatly increase basic knowledge of how plants cope with different environments and how they interact with insects that pollinate their flowers and eat their leaves. Many undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups in science, will participate in the project, gaining research experience and career training. The team will work to increase international capacity in biodiversity science by helping with field courses in Latin America, involving local research assistants at each tropical field site, and organizing an international research symposium in Costa Rica.  Finally, investigators will broadly communicate their experiences and scientific findings to the general public.  Results will help guide conservation and management of tropical forests, which are rapidly changing due to human influences.<br/><br/>Two evolutionary hypotheses for high tropical speciation rates have been proposed. First, because tropical climates are relatively stable year-round, organisms may not evolve the ability to tolerate a wide range of climates and therefore may not disperse widely. Local populations will then become isolated from their relatives and gradually become new species. Alternatively, interactions between plants and other organisms, such as pollinators and herbivores, may vary from place to place, such that a population adapted to one biological community will grow and reproduce poorly when it spreads to another community. In this way, there may be natural selection for plants in different locations to become different species. This research uses spiral gingers in the monocot genus Costus in Costa Rica and Panama to test these hypotheses about tropical speciation. Spiral gingers occupy a wide range of habitats, extending from lowlands to montane forests and from dense understory to forest edges, with different temperature, water, and soil conditions. They interact with many different orchid bee and hummingbird pollinators, highly specialized beetles that feed on young leaves, and ants that provide protection from herbivores in exchange for nectar. This work integrates phylogenetic studies, broad scale observational approaches, focused field experiments (reciprocal transplants and direct manipulations of interacting organisms and abiotic factors), and genetic mapping. It will determine how plants interact with and adapt to pollinators, herbivores, ant protectors, and climatic conditions across their geographic ranges. It will evaluate whether speciation is caused by traits and genes that have positive effects in one environment and negative effects in other environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacterial species form complex communities composed of many different functional types, and which types are present and how they behave and interact affects the overall functions produced by the ecosystem. Disturbances in ecosystems caused by things like antibiotic treatments, fertilizer runoff, or invasion by non-native species, can change the species composition of bacterial communities. Even if many of the same bacterial species remain after a disturbance, the functions they provide can be altered by the disturbance, and result in a large impact on the entire ecosystem. This project will examine how lake bacterial communities respond to a widespread disturbance impacting many waterbodies in North American - invasion by zebra and quagga mussels. These non-native mussel species have spread to lakes and rivers in over 30 US states and have had major impacts on the food webs and fisheries. Results from this project will help us understand how the ecosystem effects of these mussels is manifest through their impact on the bacterial communities. The results will help us predict how other types of disturbance will change the ecosystem services provided by the bacteria. The project will also integrate incoming undergraduate students interested in science and technology fields through an intensive summer program focused on increasing retention and diversity in science and technology majors.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to study the responses of bacterial communities to short and medium term biological disturbance, in order to separate the roles of bacterial physiological responses caused by phenotypic plasticity from ecological responses mediated by shifts in bacterial community composition. This work will explore effects of dreissenid mussel invasion in freshwater lakes on resident bacterial communities, and will employ a combination of laboratory and field experiments. The project relies on a recently developed method based on flow cytometric analysis of bacterial diversity that, when combined with sequencing based analyses, will allow the researchers to distinguish phenotypic from genotypic responses of bacterial communities. It holds promise to establish direct connections between high-throughput measurements of in situ plasticity of microbial phenotypic traits and the underlying molecular mechanism (changes in gene expression). This will not only allow the researchers to address the project's central biological question, but will also establish a new approach to tackling the importance of phenotypic plasticity more broadly in the field of microbial ecology, which currently is primarily focused on community composition shifts."

These attributes make wetlands a significant environmental, recreational, and economic resource for our nation. In freshwater wetlands, tall plants emerging from the water, such as cattails, often account for a large fraction of the plant matter produced. These plants exhibit prolific rates of growth and absorb large amounts of nutrient contaminants, improving water quality in the process. Most of this plant matter is not directly consumed by animals, but instead dies and is decomposed by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). During decomposition, nutrients trapped within plant tissues may be released via the activity of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Bacteria and fungi growing on decaying plants also serve as a key food resource for many invertebrate animals, and form a link in the flow of energy and nutrients up the food chain (to fish and waterfowl, for example) in wetland habitats. As a consequence, the productivity, nutrient uptake, and decomposition of emergent plants will profoundly affect nearly all aspects of wetland function.

Predictions for how Pacific Northwest ecosystems will respond to climate change face both scientific and social challenges. First, observed rates of climate change in this region vary in both space and time. Second, forest governance systems face conflicting pressures to provide timber, restore ecological processes, maintain biodiversity, and facilitate adaptation of forests to climate change. The goal of this long-term project is to identify the mechanisms that determine how forested mountain ecosystems respond to changes in climate, land-use, and their interactions. Over the next six years, research will focus on determining how intermittent, spatially variable flows of air, water, nutrients, organisms, and information may reduce or accentuate the effects of regional and global climate change and land use in mountain ecosystems. Simultaneously, researchers will examine how humans and institutions make decisions that affect forest governance. These approaches in combination will engage the public, resource managers, and policymakers in studies of changing social networks influencing forest landscapes and conservation ethics analyses of arguments used in forest governance. Collaborations with arts and humanities will enhance public literacy about science, demonstrate the value of long-term ecological research, and convey the strong sense of place necessary to improve the well being of individuals in society. The project will continue education, outreach and STEM development for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students and teachers as well as the public, with explicit emphasis on enhancing participation of women, people with disabilities, and under-represented minorities.<br/><br/>The project addresses the central question of how climate, natural disturbance, and land use as controlled by forest governance interact with biodiversity, hydrology, and carbon and nutrient dynamics in a forested ecosystem. Research will use the lens of ""connectivity"" to evaluate and characterize spatial and temporal patterns and processes in the old-growth temperate forests, streams, and montane meadows of the mountain landscape of the Andrews Forest. Analyses of long-term climate and hydrology records and short-term mechanistic studies will investigate patterns and drivers of air and water flow in the landscape to assess how temperature, moisture, and associated fluxes of carbon and nutrients in forested mountain ecosystems are connected to or decoupled from regional and global climate.  Analyses of long-term vegetation records combined with short-term studies of phenology and organism movement will examine the implications of timing of trophic connections and landscape connectivity for community structure and function in forests and montane meadows.  Long-term studies of stream ecosystems and short-term experiments will test how stream community structure and function depend on network-level connectivity. Researchers will study how perceptions of the landscape influence societal expectations, social networks, and social movements, and examine the relationship between the arguments underpinning forest policy and the validity and soundness of those arguments.  Research on the changing history of relations between Andrews Forest science, federal forest policymaking, and federal forest management along with the implications of that change for ecosystem function will contribute to theories regarding the role of social networks in governance and landscape transformation, and the functioning of social-ecological systems."

These attributes make wetlands a significant environmental, recreational, and economic resource for our nation. In freshwater wetlands, tall plants emerging from the water, such as cattails, often account for a large fraction of the plant matter produced. These plants exhibit prolific rates of growth and absorb large amounts of nutrient contaminants, improving water quality in the process. Most of this plant matter is not directly consumed by animals, but instead dies and is decomposed by microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). During decomposition, nutrients trapped within plant tissues may be released via the activity of bacterial and fungal decomposers. Bacteria and fungi growing on decaying plants also serve as a key food resource for many invertebrate animals, and form a link in the flow of energy and nutrients up the food chain (to fish and waterfowl, for example) in wetland habitats. As a consequence, the productivity, nutrient uptake, and decomposition of emergent plants will profoundly affect nearly all aspects of wetland function.

By integrating views, backgrounds, and tools from many types of scientists, the proposed Research Coordination Network will develop new ways of looking at the origin of life that combine different scientific perspectives. Multiple meetings and specialty workshops, will encourage scientists from many areas of science to collaborate. This will allow young scientists to create new views that merge ideas from outside their own discipline. In addition to the advances in theory and experimentation that will arise from this network there will be a massive open online course and other outreach activities that will provide the public with a clearer view of how life originated.    <br/><br/>This Research Coordination Network will move beyond debates such as which came first RNA or cellular metabolism. The project promotes Convergence by bringing together researchers from astrobiology, the study of artificial life, evolutionary biology, systems biology, bioinformatics, paleobiology, chemistry, geochemistry, planetary sciences, biochemistry, and statistical physics to explore how the pieces of the theory we have on origins of life fit together. The approach is to move from understanding how building blocks of life originated to understanding how the building blocks assembled into life. The focus is shifted from the pieces to how they become organized. The Santa Fe Institute will provide home base for a series of core meetings along with topical working groups that will explore the rules under which life is assembled.

Given the combination of environmental changes, population growth, and climate impacts, projections suggest that subsistence agriculture and coastal fisheries will fail to support the food needs of many Pacific countries by 2030.  The Solomon Islands in the Western Pacific, with their unique cultural, agricultural, and biological diversity could constitute models for how systems adapt to recurrent change.  Although Solomon Island communities have a long history of effectively addressing major unpredictable environmental and social changes, traditional strategies such as reef closures or fisheries restrictions are now faltering in many areas in response to outside forces such as emerging markets for marine resources that were previously unexploited by local people.  This project will study the relationship among pressures such as climate change and increasing human population size, the health of inter-related human-natural systems, and benefits derived from these systems such as food security, clean water, and biodiversity in order to better inform effective management of people and the land and seascapes that support them.  The project will inform future scenarios and resource management planning across a community-driven conservation network developed over the last decade in partnership with the principle investigators.  This project will also contribute to recommendations for incorporating resilience thinking into policy development for climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and natural resource management in the Pacific and globally.  The researchers will also engage in innovative ways to evaluate and broaden who is participating in the research and management process, in part by exploring technologies that embrace and use local knowledge and cultural identity.  The project will improve the ability of social and biological scientists and of decision makers to manage community landscapes for sustainability at local levels.  Additional broader impacts include training postdoctoral researchers and master's students from the United States and undergraduates from the Solomon Islands.  This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.<br/><br/>Across Pacific Island human and natural communities, recent social and ecological pressures may be changing ""biocultural"" states, defined by coupled and interwoven sets of feedbacks among social, ecological, and evolutionary processes that shape land- and seascape mosaics, communities, and resource values.  Resource use may be shifting due to underlying pressures from demographic, market, and climate changes.  Use of the term biocultural emphasizes that resource management cannot be fully understood from social or biological standpoints alone.  This project will uncover relationships among changing pressures, biocultural states, and socio-ecological benefits.  Researchers will use a pressure-state-benefit-response framework to describe and inform reef-to-ridge management across Solomon Island communities in a multivariate analysis of biocultural state and potential system resilience to ongoing or future shocks.  This project will: 1) evaluate the impact of contemporary landscape mosaic transformation on biocultural state, as defined by indicators of local ecological knowledge, biocultural connectivity, and governance; and 2) assess relationships between the current biocultural state and the state of well-being, both human (as measured by food security and access to sufficient freshwater resources) and ecological (as measured by biodiversity values at the ecosystem scale).  Researchers will analytically relate landscape transformation, biocultural state and well-being benefits to inform future scenario planning.  Researchers will model future shifts with an emphasis on the influence of climate change, market forces, and resource use scenarios to understand how components of a given biocultural state foster resilience potential.  The co-creation of empirical, culturally relevant indicators of biocultural state, combined with participatory scenario planning, will serve as a model for effective integration across western scientific and local knowledge.  This project represents a key advance for the broader scenario planning community by integrating cultural, economic and ecological considerations in a spatially explicit, transparent, and dynamic manner."

Roots play a substantial role in determining the composition and diversity of species in plant communities. Competition among plants for resources is a driving force in shaping plant communities, and root competition often has stronger effects than aboveground competition. A recent review of root competition research concludes that to understand plant community structure we need to know more about the mechanisms by which plants interact belowground. This project investigates mechanisms of root interactions by determining how root growth responds to two important cues that plants encounter in the soil: nutrient availability and the presence of the roots of competitors. How root growth responses influence competition and community structure will be investigated with this research. A graduate student and three undergraduates will contribute to the research, and this project will be used to introduce non-science majors to the principles of scientific research.<br/><br/>Roots encounter many cues in the soil which may trigger changes in growth patterns to maximize plant fitness. This research focuses on two cues that are well studied but still not fully understood: nutrient-rich patches, and roots of neighbors. Responses to these cues will be studied for a set of eight co-occurring grassland plant species. Individuals will be grown in soil with even or patchy distribution of resources and in the presence or absence of neighbors, to determine whether species differ in response to neighbors and whether responses to resources depend on the presence of neighbors. The species identity and relative abundance of roots in samples from two-species pots will be determined using a set of species-specific DNA markers. In a second experiment, communities of seven or eight species will be grown in greenhouse microcosms to determine whether species' response traits influence community structure or the ability of seedlings to establish in existing vegetation. In addition, methods will be developed for classroom investigations of root growth, with plants grown in clear plastic containers so that roots can be readily observed and measured. Students in an ecology class for non-science majors will use this system to practice the scientific method while asking questions about root growth of native and non-native species."

These studies will provide important insights into forest evolution in tropical climates, the timing and patterns of ecological expansion of flowering plants, the habitats of dinosaurs and early mammals, and the history of vegetation for the western interior of North America. Most of these plant fossils collected this research represent species new to science and can provide important historical records for living lineages.

It also has several major initiatives for education and public outreach, including the development, testing, and dissemination of lesson plans for science teachers about the rise of flowering plants and modern forests. <br/><br/>This project will use extensive paleontological field studies, fossil collections, and new quantitative techniques to generate extensive reconstructions of late Campanian forests from fossilized leaves, wood, seeds and fruits. By using newly developed sampling and analytical techniques, these studies will generate reconstructions of the diversity and ecological structure of the paleo forests. The fossil floras are from the Jose Creek Member of the McRae Formation in south-central New Mexico, which was located >200 km inland of the Western Interior Seaway. The diversity and community structure of the fossil forests will be reconstructed using spatial distributions of plant species across the landscape, while the functional ecology of the plants will be reconstructed by measuring traits of leaves, wood, and seeds/fruits that are reflective of life form, physiology, growth rate, and reproductive strategy. This information, when combined with analyses of climatically similar Cretaceous, Cenozoic, and extant floras, will be used to test hypotheses about: 1) the community structure and roles of major clades in Campanian floras; 2) the functional ecology of Cretaceous angiosperms; and 3) how the ecological structure of forests has changed through time in warm-wet climates. The functional trait-based approach used will link extant and paleo-ecology, and have broad applicability to understanding ecological radiations and community turnover following key evolutionary innovations."

Referred to as a ""carbon bank"", scientists believe that the carbon stored in peat is at risk of being released to the atmosphere in response to environmental change.  Mosses often dominate plant production in peatland ecosystems, which are concentrated in northern regions where the environment can become extremely cold and is nutrient poor.  Similar to humans or to other plants, mosses contain a diverse microbiome, microbes that are intimately associated with the plant in a symbiotic relationship, that help the host to grow and thrive under extreme conditions.  The plant host provides the microbiome with a stable environment in which to live and in turn the microbes are believed to help mosses acquire nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon.  For example, some microbes convert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into a form that moss plants can use.  Similarly, there are microbes that can also help mosses acquire carbon from the conversion of methane (natural gas produced in wetland soils) to carbon dioxide. This research will determine how much and how fast nitrogen and carbon are metabolized by peat moss microbiomes, as well as the implications for the growth of peat mosses and carbon storage in northern peatland ecosystems in Minnesota and Canada.   Taking advantage of a large whole ecosystem experiment, the project will further examine the response of peat mosses and their constituent microbiomes to environmental change.  This project will provide fundamental research on how microbiomes aid the growth of peat moss plants, which may store more carbon than any other plant on Earth.  Results of the project will be used to improve predictions on whether peatlands will act as a net carbon source or sink in response to ongoing environmental change as well as the potential use of plant microbiomes as a natural biofilter for methane produced in landfills. This research will also serve society by teaching the next generation of scientists about the important ecosystem services that wetlands provide and the role of microbes in maintaining these services.  At least two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher will be involved in all aspects of the project.  Two signature activities will be used as instruments to communicate project results to the public.  A 5-day workshop in a Georgia wetland will train 16 middle and high school teachers on developing lesson plans for teaching ecosystem science in the context of conservation, restoration, and global environmental change. Project results will be disseminated to the public through an annual interactive activity at the Atlanta Science Festival (which reaches 20,000 people per year).<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research is to investigate the role of the peat moss microbiome in regulating peatland carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles and the resilience of peatlands to environmental change.  Objectives are to: 1) quantify in situ rates of nitrogen fixation and methanotrophy, and elucidate the contribution of keystone microbial associates mediating these processes in the peat moss microbiome, 2) determine the response of nitrogen fixation and its coupling to methane(CH4) dynamics to perturbation of environmental change drivers in the laboratory and in a large-scale whole ecosystem experiment in the field, and 3) leverage datasets from two long-term field sites to estimate the microbiome contribution to ecosystem N and C budgets as well as model the response of microbiome function to perturbation of environmental change drivers. Working hypotheses include: H1: N fixation is a predominant N input to northern peatlands; H2: The dominant nitrogen fixers are methanotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria; H3: Methanotrophs that also fix N represent a substantial CH4 sink;  H4: Net primary production by peat mosses is directly supported by N acquired from nitrogen fixation and methane-derived C from methanotrophy; H5: Peat moss productivity and its response to environmental perturbations will be largely determined by plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions; H6: Increases in temperature and CO2 will result in lower rates of N fixation due to decreased peat moss productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These differences are largely explained by differences in how males and females express genes: how each sex uses the information in the genome to produce RNA and proteins. This type of difference in gene expression is thought to evolve as a result of genetic conflict - expression of a gene in the same way in both males and females could benefit one sex while having harmful effects in the other. Differences between males and females in gene expression can resolve such conflicts by allowing each to express a gene in a way that is beneficial for itself. In addition, differences in expression could even be fine-tuned to maximize the benefit according to the organism's environment. However, little is currently known about the molecular causes of differential gene expression between males and females, how it varies, and how it affects traits. This project focuses on differential expression in hormone signaling and looks at its genetic and environmental variation. It connects expression differences to reproductive traits and survivorship in typical and stressful environments. It will also test whether hormone signaling can resolve genetic conflict between the sexes. The project includes outreach and educational programs that will increase student awareness of and skills in research science in the areas of genomics, evolution and computational biology. A free summer science educational enrichment program for gifted students from underrepresented backgrounds in Alabama and Georgia will be run, supporting opportunities for these students and their teachers to engage in a summer research experiences at Auburn University. Also, work related to the project will be integrated into course-based undergraduate research experiences for Auburn University undergraduates. <br/><br/>Recent work in the model organism Drosophila has shown that even under standardized conditions, the number and identity of genes that differ in expression between the sexes can vary substantially across genotypes. Similar changes are observed in response to environmental perturbations. These sex differences may also be modified by the nutrient and stress sensing insulin signaling pathway - one of three major, interconnected, hormone signaling pathways that regulate many fitness-related traits in adult insects. This project addresses challenges in understanding sex-differential expression and its evolution by focusing on a single type of conflict, intralocus conflict, and a single set of pathways that regulate sexually dimorphic traits, the insulin and ecdysone hormone signaling pathways. Genetic and environmental variability will be assessed and used to relate sex-differences in expression to sex-differences in fitness-related traits for individual alleles of sex-differentially expressed genes. Transcriptomic analyses of expression variation among outbred genotypes will be combined with molecular-genetic and environmental perturbations in a novel way. Allele-specific expression studies will be connected to allele-specific assays of fitness-related traits and combined with population genomic studies focused on the cis regulatory regions responsible for hormone regulation, as well as protein coding regions of hormone signaling regulated genes. While there is considerable diversity in sex determination mechanisms across taxa, the insulin-signaling pathway is widely conserved, as is steroid hormone signaling through nuclear receptor superfamily members. The knowledge that will be gained as a result of this project will therefore be broadly important for a mechanistic understanding of sexual conflict and the origins of sexual dimorphism, especially with respect to the role of environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, a hybrid of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and a recently discovered species, Saccharomyces eubayanus, are cold-adapted and are used in other applications. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) which traits were contributed to lager yeast by each parent, 2) which genetic changes occurred in the brewing environment, 3) and whether variation in the parental species contributed to lager yeast traits. Hundreds of genome sequences of yeasts isolated from natural and brewing environments will be generated and analyzed to identify candidate differences, which will be tested through genetic manipulation.<br/> Understanding how wild yeast adapt to industrial environments will provide a framework and candidate genes for improving biofuel strains. This project will also help train the next generation of scientists and educators, from high school students and teachers to postdoctoral researchers, including individuals from underrepresented minority backgrounds. In particular, the Yeast Exploration and Analysis Science Team (""Wild YEAST Program"") directly involves high school and early-stage undergraduate students in using modern isolation and genetic identification techniques to study natural variation and genetic diversity in Saccharomyces and other yeasts.

This research will address how genetic diversity is affected by trees' ability to grow and defend themselves against insect attack, and by competition from neighboring trees for resources.  Also, forest productivity will be explored in light of genetic diversity. The research will take place in experimental stands of aspen, where trees have been grown for several years at different densities and then subjected to an outbreak of leaf-eating caterpillars. This work will advance scientific knowledge of how best to manage forests to maximize production, while also minimizing insect damage. Results from this research will be particularly relevant to regions where aspen populations are in widespread decline. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in biological science and promote mentoring of high school and college students from groups that are currently under-represented in science.<br/><br/>This research will explore how environmentally mediated growth-defense tradeoffs in a foundation plant species influence intraspecific (genotypic) variation and, in turn, how genotypic  variation shapes stand-level productivity and resistance to insect attack. Aspen exhibits striking genotypic variation in physiology, growth and chemical defense, and strong negative genotypic correlations between growth and defense. How such tradeoffs influence selection to shape the genetic architecture of plant populations is largely unknown. An array of experimental aspen stands, each containing 16 genotypes and subjected to low or high intraspecific competition intensity (CI), will be used to test hypotheses concerning: 1) phenotypic expression of leaf physiological and chemical traits under low vs. high CI, 2) shifts in the genotypic composition of aspen stands as a consequence of competition-mediated selection for growth vs. defense traits, and 3) effects of genotypic divergence on stand resistance to defoliation by forest tent caterpillars. Hypothesis testing will incorporate measures of aboveground growth, photosynthesis and foliar chemical defenses, as well as assessments of stand-level defoliation by tent caterpillars. This research will advance understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that influence the distribution, genetic composition, and function of forest ecosystems."

Our current understanding of the factors that control belowground carbon allocation is significantly weaker than aboveground allocation. Yet, in grasslands the amount of carbon that goes belowground each year is much larger than the amount of carbon allocated aboveground. Our rudimentary understanding of the controls of belowground carbon allocation and the ratio of aboveground to belowground carbon is a significant knowledge gap, as roots are a major input of organic material and nutrients into soil. Predictions of future carbon storage in these ecosystems hinge on our understanding of the effects of environmental availability on allocation of carbon belowground. This study addresses the questions: How does precipitation affect the above/belowground partitioning of carbon?  During drought periods, are above and belowground structures equally affected, or are roots affected less than leaves and branches?  Finally, is the effect of precipitation on carbon allocation constant or does it vary from deserts to humid grasslands?  This project will install experiments in New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas to understand the effect of precipitation on the partitioning of carbon above versus belowground and the underlying mechanisms.<br/><br/>This proposal presents three novel hypotheses based on: (1) a plant-response mechanism, suggesting decreased belowground allocation with increasing water availability, and (2) a trophic-cascade mechanism, suggesting the opposite pattern derived from the differential sensitivity of root feeders and their predators to water availability. A final hypothesis (3) suggests that the magnitude of plant responses decreases from arid to humid grasslands while the magnitude of the trophic-cascade phenomenon increases. The trophic-cascade mechanism may be constrained by the abundance of belowground predators in arid grasslands, which is greater in humid ecosystems. The experimental design includes complementary field and microcosm experiments located in three different ecosystem types: Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, NM, Shortgrass Steppe, CO, and Tallgrass Prairie, KS. The field experiment includes additions and reductions of precipitation at each site. The microcosm experiment is based on monoliths subjected to 4 soil fauna treatments x 5 water manipulations. Soil fauna treatments consist of (1) soil devoid of fauna (just native bacteria and fungi), (2) defaunated soil inoculated with nematode root feeders, (3) defaunated soil inoculated with nematode root feeders and nematode predators, and (4) control.  Microcosm tubes will be located in each of the water manipulation plots using individuals of the dominant grass species of each ecosystem type. This project will train a post-doctoral fellow and graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. Collaboration with the Asombro Institute for Science Education, a non-profit organization that provides award-winning science education to more than 12,000 children and 4,500 adults annually in southern New Mexico and western Texas, will include establishing a demonstration project of a soil-observation window at the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park. Partnerships with the ""Ask A Biologist"" program will result in an article on the interactions between plants and belowground organisms and how these interactions are modulated by water availability. The project will contribute special events associated with the effects of climate on belowground processes during a summer sustainability program that engages local teachers and students, and the ""Managing the Planet"" series aimed at the general public."

Over very long time periods, this diversity of plants is produced by speciation, the complicated process whereby one species becomes two. This project will test ideas about how speciation happens in tropical forests. It will also greatly increase basic knowledge of how plants cope with different environments and how they interact with insects that pollinate their flowers and eat their leaves. Many undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups in science, will participate in the project, gaining research experience and career training. The team will work to increase international capacity in biodiversity science by helping with field courses in Latin America, involving local research assistants at each tropical field site, and organizing an international research symposium in Costa Rica.  Finally, investigators will broadly communicate their experiences and scientific findings to the general public.  Results will help guide conservation and management of tropical forests, which are rapidly changing due to human influences.<br/><br/>Two evolutionary hypotheses for high tropical speciation rates have been proposed. First, because tropical climates are relatively stable year-round, organisms may not evolve the ability to tolerate a wide range of climates and therefore may not disperse widely. Local populations will then become isolated from their relatives and gradually become new species. Alternatively, interactions between plants and other organisms, such as pollinators and herbivores, may vary from place to place, such that a population adapted to one biological community will grow and reproduce poorly when it spreads to another community. In this way, there may be natural selection for plants in different locations to become different species. This research uses spiral gingers in the monocot genus Costus in Costa Rica and Panama to test these hypotheses about tropical speciation. Spiral gingers occupy a wide range of habitats, extending from lowlands to montane forests and from dense understory to forest edges, with different temperature, water, and soil conditions. They interact with many different orchid bee and hummingbird pollinators, highly specialized beetles that feed on young leaves, and ants that provide protection from herbivores in exchange for nectar. This work integrates phylogenetic studies, broad scale observational approaches, focused field experiments (reciprocal transplants and direct manipulations of interacting organisms and abiotic factors), and genetic mapping. It will determine how plants interact with and adapt to pollinators, herbivores, ant protectors, and climatic conditions across their geographic ranges. It will evaluate whether speciation is caused by traits and genes that have positive effects in one environment and negative effects in other environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Living organisms acquire iodine through their diet in most cases and iodine is made available through biogeochemical cycling of this element.  Most of what is known regarding the biogeochemical cycling of iodine comes from studies of seawaters and the atmosphere. While marine systems are a major global source of iodine, they do not account for total global iodine production.  This research will help explain how bacteria in soil and sediments also contribute to global iodine cycling by studying genes potentially associated with iodine modification and by using laboratory techniques that replicate how different bacteria in terrestrial environments may work together to accomplish modifications of iodine compounds.   Additionally, the outcomes of this research will improve the ability to predict how well certain bacteria will be able to modify radioactive iodine compounds.  This has implications for the health of numerous ecosystems and populations that are currently threatened by radioactive iodine contamination. This project is a collaboration between Howard University and Alabama A&M University researchers and students (both undergraduate and graduate), and scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.  Outreach activities in association with this project include presentations on environmental science and research techniques, as well as tours of research labs for students at the Howard University Middle School for Mathematics and Science. <br/> <br/>In assessing the activities of bacterial communities in biogeochemical cycling of iodine this project will: 1) use functional genomics and metagenomics approaches to identify bacterial genes that contribute to the iodine redox cycle, iodination of organic compounds and accumulation of iodine and 2) develop and characterize re-engineered ecosystems derived from multispecies biofilm-based in vitro models for intracommunity interactions to investigate the activities of these bacteria in enriched communities, in isolation and in engineered communities.  The results of this project will reveal the diversity of terrestrial bacteria that contribute in a variety of ways to global cycling of iodine and the underlying mechanisms, including microbe-microbe interactions and, potentially, previously uncharacterized biochemical pathways that drive these processes. This study represents the first multi-target, molecular and culture-based investigation of iodine cycling at both single species and multispecies levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation in nature is also useful for increasing crop yields and for the conservation of wild species. One such challenge faced by organisms at high latitudes is freezing temperatures. This research investigates the genetics of freezing tolerance in the mouse-eared cress, a relative of many crop species that has become a ""model"" organism for which many genetic tools have been developed. In earlier work, the researchers collected seeds of this species from Italy and Sweden and planted them in experimental gardens located in each country. They found that freezing tolerance is required to survive the long, cold winters in Sweden, whereas freezing tolerance reduces performance in Italy. This result exemplifies the concept of biological ""trade-offs""; adaptation to one environment often reduces performance elsewhere. This simple principle can explain why there are so many different species on earth, in that each species is adapted to a particular environment. The research investigates the genetic control of freezing tolerance and explores the mechanisms that contribute to the tradeoff in performance across environments. The genetic mechanisms identified in these studies may be useful tools for producing new crop varieties with increased yield in cold climates. In addition, the research team will perform outreach activities that advance scientific literacy and promote careers in science. Michigan State University scientists will contribute to a partnership between K-12 teachers and the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station to develop lesson plans that support Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for inquiry based learning.<br/><br/>The research employs cutting edge genetic technologies to address the mechanisms and adaptive value of freezing tolerance using three complementary approaches. First, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be further examined in the two original populations in Sweden and Italy using new lines manipulating freezing tolerance genes in otherwise homogeneous parental backgrounds. These lines will then be grown in controlled environment chambers and in the field to estimate the importance of freezing tolerance genes for genetic trade-offs in performance across environments. Second, the genetic basis of freezing tolerance will be investigated in <br/>four new populations from Scandinavia and Spain with dramatic differences in freezing tolerance. Third, this research will be expanded to an even broader scale, asking if the same genes for freezing tolerance found in these focal populations are found in other geographic regions. The techniques employed in part three are similar to those used to study the genetics of many human diseases. Taken together, these studies examine the genetic basis of freezing tolerance in a broad diversity of natural populations and assess the mechanisms of performance trade-offs for this important adaptive trait."

From one perspective, this can be a big problem, costing billions in damage repair to man-made structures and termite eradication. On the other hand, it is also an opportunity to understand how energy can be efficiently extracted from wood. Termites rely on a complex community of microorganisms in their hindgut to break down wood and provide energy for themselves. However, the identity of many of these organisms, and the specific roles they each play in wood digestion, are still unknown. This research focuses on a highly invasive and destructive subterranean species of termite, and aims to identify the community diversity of their associated microorganisms and to understand their specific roles in the wood digestion process. This can be achieved in part through genome sequencing, as each microorganism's metabolic capabilities can be predicted from its genome sequence. This information is fundamentally important for science and society as it may enable exploring alternative approaches to biological termite control as well as biofuel and biomaterial production. In addition to providing research training for students, this project also develops an interactive outreach module for K-12 students to help spark appreciation for science, technology, and engineering research.<br/><br/>The Coptotermes formosanus hindgut community includes large, complex eukaryotic microbes called hypermastigotes. Their genomes are unexplored but are expected to be very large, necessitating deep sequencing. The hindgut community also includes bacteria, archaea, and viruses, at highly variable abundances. To adequately sequence microbes from each of these ""domains"" of life, enrichment steps will be performed before sequencing, namely isolation of hypermastigote nuclei, isolation of viral particles, and rolling-circle amplification of lower abundance bacterial genomes. Assembled microbial genomes will be identified by 16S or 18S ribosomal RNA genes, so that carbohydrate active enzyme genes can be assigned to microbial species. Nitrogen fixing capability will also be inferred by quantitative real-time PCR of nifH genes. For the most abundant bacteria, their symbiotic status (ectosymbiont, endosymbiont, or free swimming) will be determined through fluorescent in-situ hybridization.

Given the combination of environmental changes, population growth, and climate impacts, projections suggest that subsistence agriculture and coastal fisheries will fail to support the food needs of many Pacific countries by 2030.  The Solomon Islands in the Western Pacific, with their unique cultural, agricultural, and biological diversity could constitute models for how systems adapt to recurrent change.  Although Solomon Island communities have a long history of effectively addressing major unpredictable environmental and social changes, traditional strategies such as reef closures or fisheries restrictions are now faltering in many areas in response to outside forces such as emerging markets for marine resources that were previously unexploited by local people.  This project will study the relationship among pressures such as climate change and increasing human population size, the health of inter-related human-natural systems, and benefits derived from these systems such as food security, clean water, and biodiversity in order to better inform effective management of people and the land and seascapes that support them.  The project will inform future scenarios and resource management planning across a community-driven conservation network developed over the last decade in partnership with the principle investigators.  This project will also contribute to recommendations for incorporating resilience thinking into policy development for climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and natural resource management in the Pacific and globally.  The researchers will also engage in innovative ways to evaluate and broaden who is participating in the research and management process, in part by exploring technologies that embrace and use local knowledge and cultural identity.  The project will improve the ability of social and biological scientists and of decision makers to manage community landscapes for sustainability at local levels.

Use of the term biocultural emphasizes that resource management cannot be fully understood from social or biological standpoints alone.  This project will uncover relationships among changing pressures, biocultural states, and socio-ecological benefits.  Researchers will use a pressure-state-benefit-response framework to describe and inform reef-to-ridge management across Solomon Island communities in a multivariate analysis of biocultural state and potential system resilience to ongoing or future shocks.  This project will: 1) evaluate the impact of contemporary landscape mosaic transformation on biocultural state, as defined by indicators of local ecological knowledge, biocultural connectivity, and governance; and 2) assess relationships between the current biocultural state and the state of well-being, both human (as measured by food security and access to sufficient freshwater resources) and ecological (as measured by biodiversity values at the ecosystem scale).  Researchers will analytically relate landscape transformation, biocultural state and well-being benefits to inform future scenario planning.  Researchers will model future shifts with an emphasis on the influence of climate change, market forces, and resource use scenarios to understand how components of a given biocultural state foster resilience potential.  The co-creation of empirical, culturally relevant indicators of biocultural state, combined with participatory scenario planning, will serve as a model for effective integration across western scientific and local knowledge.

However, studying microbes is challenging because they are so small and because they live in complex communities. Most microbial species cannot be cultivated in the lab. Therefore, to understand the diversity, evolution, and ecology of microbes, scientists typically extract bulk DNA from the environment. This can reveal which types of microbes are present, but it does not provide information about what each species looks like and which species are carrying out which processes. In this project, researchers will develop a device to separate complex microbial communities into their individual species. The researchers will share this separation technology broadly with other scientists in the microbial systematics, diversity, and ecology communities to help accelerate research in these areas. An interactive outreach module will be developed and brought to K-12 students to help spark appreciation for science, technology, and engineering research.<br/><br/>This project will develop a method using dielectrophoresis to separate microbial communities based on morphotypes. Dielectrophoresis is the movement of uncharged particles in an electric field. Particles of similar size, shape, and surface characteristics move in similar ways and are expected to accumulate in the same compartment of a gated microscopic channel once an electrical field is applied. This approach will advance the fields of microbial systematics and biodiversity science by enabling scientists to link morphological and molecular biodiversity in understudied microbial communities.  The separation device will be used to answer two main questions about the evolution of symbiotic, wood-digesting protozoa that live in termite hindguts. First, how did the ancestor of termite hindgut protozoa acquire the ability to digest wood? For this project, tens of thousands of cells from key protozoan species will be separated from the rest of their communities for transcriptome sequencing. Genes for wood digesting enzymes will be identified and phylogenetically analyzed along with related genes from other organisms. Second, have protozoan symbionts transferred from one termite species to another in the genus Zootermopsis? And if so, can this explain the greater diversity of protozoa relative to their hosts? For this project, the hindgut communities of four Zootermopsis species will be separated into their constituent species in order to determine how many protozoan species are present and how closely they are related to one another. This information will be compared to the phylogeny and biogeography of Zootermopsis termites to determine whether and when such transfers may have occurred."

Over very long time periods, this diversity of plants is produced by speciation, the complicated process whereby one species becomes two. This project will test ideas about how speciation happens in tropical forests. It will also greatly increase basic knowledge of how plants cope with different environments and how they interact with insects that pollinate their flowers and eat their leaves. Many undergraduate and graduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups in science, will participate in the project, gaining research experience and career training. The team will work to increase international capacity in biodiversity science by helping with field courses in Latin America, involving local research assistants at each tropical field site, and organizing an international research symposium in Costa Rica.  Finally, investigators will broadly communicate their experiences and scientific findings to the general public.  Results will help guide conservation and management of tropical forests, which are rapidly changing due to human influences.<br/><br/>Two evolutionary hypotheses for high tropical speciation rates have been proposed. First, because tropical climates are relatively stable year-round, organisms may not evolve the ability to tolerate a wide range of climates and therefore may not disperse widely. Local populations will then become isolated from their relatives and gradually become new species. Alternatively, interactions between plants and other organisms, such as pollinators and herbivores, may vary from place to place, such that a population adapted to one biological community will grow and reproduce poorly when it spreads to another community. In this way, there may be natural selection for plants in different locations to become different species. This research uses spiral gingers in the monocot genus Costus in Costa Rica and Panama to test these hypotheses about tropical speciation. Spiral gingers occupy a wide range of habitats, extending from lowlands to montane forests and from dense understory to forest edges, with different temperature, water, and soil conditions. They interact with many different orchid bee and hummingbird pollinators, highly specialized beetles that feed on young leaves, and ants that provide protection from herbivores in exchange for nectar. This work integrates phylogenetic studies, broad scale observational approaches, focused field experiments (reciprocal transplants and direct manipulations of interacting organisms and abiotic factors), and genetic mapping. It will determine how plants interact with and adapt to pollinators, herbivores, ant protectors, and climatic conditions across their geographic ranges. It will evaluate whether speciation is caused by traits and genes that have positive effects in one environment and negative effects in other environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecological disturbances often favor growth of cyanobacteria because of their capability to adapt to rapid changes in the environment. Sometimes changes in environmental conditions can result in dense populations of cyanobacteria, (algal bloom) and they may also produce high concentrations of toxins (cyanotoxins) that kill fish and are a hazard to humans. The goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to test whether cyanotoxins have an important alternative biochemical and ecological function, namely, to protect the cyanobacteria by removing hydrogen peroxide. If this proves to be true, it would transform our understanding of the structure and function of freshwater lakes.  The results from this EAGER project may also lead to more effective and economical management of harmful cyanobacerial blooms. Cyanotoxins released during harmful algal blooms can pose health risks, and require millions of dollars to decontaminate freshwater supplies. The project will also include research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with efforts to broaden participation in science.<br/><br/>One of the most important environmental gradients is formed by oxygen, and its availability is fundamental to the distribution patterns of life. Cyanobacteria were the first lineage to establish oxygen-producing photosynthesis. Cyanobacterial photosynthesis captures solar energy, but it comes at the risk of producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. The development of a cellular process capable of handling intracellular reactive oxygen molecules was key to the evolution of cyanobacterial photosynthesis. This EAGER project will test an intriguing hypothesis about why cyanobacteria produce cyanotoxins, that they function to sequester hydrogen peroxide, or otherwise convert it to a non-reactive form. In this project, toxic and non-toxic cyanobacterial strains will be compared with respect to hydrogen peroxide production. A new hydrogen peroxide microsensor will be used to examine the microscale distribution of hydrogen peroxide in thin surface lake water to determine whether (consistent with the hypothesis) it is inversely proportional with the abundance of toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Finally, studies will determine whether the ability to isolate and grow novel cyanobacteria in culture can be improved by adding alpha-keto acids to scavenge any hydrogen peroxide produced by cells."

Acidification events are short periods of time, from a few days to weeks, when the stream water becomes moderately acidic.  These events result from the breakdown of forest organic material releasing carbon dioxide that moves with the water into streams, creating acid conditions in streams. Changes in acidification can affect the way streams function and their biodiversity.  Research in lowland streams in Costa Rica suggest that stream invertebrates and algae, can withstand moderately acid conditions, but are negatively affected when acid conditions are extreme.  This project investigates how periodic acidification affect streams in lowland Costa Rica.  The research will take place at La Selva Biological Station, on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica, where streams have been under study for more than 25 years.  The main objective of this work is to understand the mechanisms and consequences of changing precipitation patterns on the acidity, biology and ecosystem functions of tropical streams.  Acidification is a common phenomenon in streams wordwide, thus it is important to understand it in order to protect and sustain stream ecosystems. The research (1) will contribute to understanding how changing patterns of rainfall affect stream biodiversity and ecosystem function, (2) provide research training for graduate and undergraduate students, and (3) provide environmental outreach through a citizen science project using the iNaturalist mobile device application. <br/><br/>The study will further ongoing long-term research on the consequences of changing patterns of precipitation on lowland tropical streams in Costa Rica.  Ongoing LTREB research described the occurrence of episodic acidification events.  It was hypothesized that an influx of soil-derived CO2 via subsurface flow paths contributes to those pH declines, signaling a tight coupling among rainfall, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems. Precipitation-driven acidification events are stronger and more common in solute-poor, poorly-buffered, streams than in solute-rich, well-buffered, streams - a characteristic of the study landscape.  This project will evaluate and further develop this hypothesis by (1) assessing the relation among daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal patterns in stream water chemistry with major climate events (e.g., El Nio and La Nia - ENSO), by (2) assessing biotic responses to climate-driven acidification, and by (3) experimentally buffering a low-solute stream against acidification related to ENSO events. Climate trends and global circulation models predict changes in the frequency and intensity of weather extremes. For Central America, models predict greater seasonality, similar to patterns observed during ENSO years.  In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, El Nio events result in abnormally low precipitation during the dry season, while La Nia results is high precipitation.  Thus, the project will advance our understanding the consequences of extreme weather events on tropical lowland stream ecosystems."

Researchers will conduct experiments to test hypotheses concerning the importance of algae and the food web of insects and invertebrates that algal production supports, to accumulation of carbon in peatlands. Food webs are a poorly know aspect of peatland ecology, and a better understanding of what controls biotic interactions within them will have profound implications for understanding the global carbon cycle.

Through a contribution of carbon subsidies and by modifying redox potential for heterotrophic microorganisms, the investigators propose that algal photosynthesis fuels a microbial loop and contributes to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen fluxes. The research will evaluate the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down effects (and their interactions) on boreal peatland food webs using a factorial experiment to test three hypotheses: 1) Under low nutrient availability, algal biomass is constrained and decomposition is primarily regulated by detrital pathways. 2) Increasing nutrient availability promotes algal biomass and the transfer of energy to grazers, releasing higher trophic levels from resource limitation. 3) The presence of a second energy pathway in algae (edible vs. inedible) mutes the trophic cascade, leading to greater stability (i.e., lower coefficients of variance) in food web structure than would be expected with strong top-down control of a homogenous edible community."

The on-going effort to survey, inventory, and preserve the ocean's biological diversity is threatened by a shortage of taxonomic expertise. Although focused on Caribbean biodiversity, the overarching goal of this project is to promote conservation of marine biodiversity around the world. This project will make it easier to correctly identify and document marine biodiversity, to detect invasive species, and to protect rare and endangered species by training new taxonomists, by developing Internet-based resources to support taxonomic research, and by making taxonomic methods easily accessible to non-specialists.  This project will create new taxonomic descriptions and revisions of currently undescribed species from the Caribbean, which will be immediately useful to any researcher, manager, or conservation practitioner working in the region, and will contribute to the species inventory of the Caribbean. Open-access videos and how-to guides will allow specialists to convey enthusiasm for these organisms to the public, to managers, and to policy makers, and provide a way for students and the general public to learn more about taxonomy. <br/><br/>This project has three parts with complementary aims. Part A will document the biodiversity of 6 groups of marine organisms with high, but poorly known, diversity in the Southern Caribbean (sponges, hydroids, sea anemones, sea squirts, ribbon worms, and seaweeds). This work will emphasize the integration of traditional morphological and molecular characters with non-traditional characters such as larval morphology, live coloration, and characters derived from confocal and electron microscopy. Established experts will work closely with experts-in-training, with a focus on species from the Caribbean coast of Panama that are known to be in particular need of taxonomic revision. Part B will provide training workshops for graduate students and junior researchers interested in developing taxonomic expertise in one of 6 focal groups; enabling them to (1) identify species in the field, (2) efficiently collect and preserve material for subsequent taxonomic work, (3) use existing keys or monographs to identify material to species, and (4) develop personal connections with a global network of other students and specialists. Part C will make the basic skills and vocabulary involved in the taxonomy of all 6 groups globally accessible to both expert and non-specialist workers in biodiversity and conservation. This part will develop a standard package of internet-based tools for each group, including a set of how-to videos and illustrated definitions of technical terms, with translations into several languages. This toolkit will be designed to facilitate rapid biodiversity documentation and to increase the precision of preliminary field identifications."

Earth system models often fail to capture the magnitude or global distribution of these nitrogen gas losses. Denitrification occurs under low-oxygen conditions, and measurements are complicated by both analytical challenges and tremendous spatial and temporal variation. This project will apply a suite of measurement approaches to test hypotheses about the way that several environmental factors regulate denitrification, and it will improve the representation of denitrification in an important earth system model. This research has important implications for policies regulating nitrogen as an air and water pollutant, and improvements to the earth system model support international science and policy programs for predicting future environmental change.<br/><br/>This project will advance understanding of the environmental regulation of denitrification in both field studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and as represented by the Community Land Model (CLM-CN). At Hubbard Brook, the project will test the role of several environmental factors hypothesized to regulate denitrification, including soil oxygen levels, soil depth, rainfall variability, soil warming, and soil acidification. The project will deploy measurement approaches that include soil core-based fluxes of nitrogen gases, continuous soil oxygen sensors, chamber-based gas fluxes, and nitrate stable isotopes. Together these measurements will provide a comprehensive assessment of denitrification and its environmental drivers, and will enable this project to improve representation of plant-microbe competition and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen biogeochemistry in the Community Land Model. The project will also train two graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, and it will offer hands-on biogeochemistry boot camps for diverse groups of graduate students on the advanced techniques used for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and related ecosystem processes."

Millions of dollars are invested in riparian forest restoration each year by state, federal, and private agencies and institutions.  However, little is known about how long it takes for the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of a stream ecosystem to be restored so that the ecosystem can once again provide the services that humans need (i.e. it is swimmable, fishable, drinkable).  Nor is there much known about the stages that the stream ecosystem passes through during that restoration process and the stream?s relative functionality at each stage. This project will document the time frames of various stages of stream ecosystem restoration, characterize the sequence of those changes through time, and reveal whether the trajectory of recovery of stream ecosystem structure (physical, chemical, biological) parallels that of ecosystem function (delivery of service to humans).  This information, in turn, will help provide the technical basis for better managing riparian corridors so that both the quantity and quality of fresh water for both humans and wildlife can be sustained at a high level for future generations.<br/><br/>The negative effects of eliminating riparian forest along stream ecosystems are well documented.  Yet, the science of stream ecosystem recovery to riparian forest restoration is weak at best.  This project quantifies the trajectory of stream ecosystem recovery in terms of its physical structure, flow of energy, cycling of nutrients, and the composition of biological communities following reforestation of meadows or pastures with native deciduous trees. As the planted forest grows and matures, research will focus on the time frames over which stream ecosystem variables change compared to reference- endpoints of a mature forested- and meadow stream reach. The project is interdisciplinary, and brings together research in fluvial geomorphology, hydrology, biogeochemistry, organic and isotope geochemistry, nutrient cycling, and community ecology of heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms, macroinvertebrates, and fishes to describe the trajectory of stream change as a forested riparian matures.  Key research questions include: the change over time and order of change of different biophysical variables, such as light, temperature, channel geomorphology, bed complexity and hyporheic zone exchange, to documenting the efficiency and magnitude of food-web processing of organic Carbon as organic inputs change during reforestation and the relationship between the level of ecosystem services such as Carbon and Nitrogen processing scale and the degree of stream ecosystem restoration.  The project includes several innovative approaches including large wood debris inventories and fate-tracking, hyporheic exchange studies, LIDAR earth/vegetation surveys, molecular fingerprint analysis of microbial communities, species level analysis of macroinvertebrate community structure, fish biomass and productivity measures, and stable isotope analysis of food and functional feeding animal groups.

Since an early divergence from other land plants some 450 million years ago, mosses took a different path than vascular plants to solving the challenges to survival and reproduction posed by terrestrial environments. One important trait that is well developed in mosses is the capability of drying without dying, known as desiccation tolerance (DT). This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress. Specific methods to be employed include: (1) sequencing the full genomes of S. caninervis and S. ruralis; (2) using next generation sequencing (NGS) to develop genotypic markers for population-level genetic variation studies, signature transcriptome tools for phenotypic analyses (related to ecophysiological and ecosystem investigations), and multiple single-copy genes for phylogenetic analysis; (3) transcriptomics experiments comparing different development stages and sexes of both species in response to desiccation stress and reproductive state; (3) ecophysiological experiments on multiple populations of S. caninervis and S. ruralis, and all 15 species of N. American Syntrichia, to assess phenotypic plasticity in the key trait of DT; (5) population genetic studies of S. caninervis and S. ruralis in different environments; (6) building a robust phylogeny for Syntrichia and using it to understand evolutionary trends and correlations among the traits under study, as well as to produce a refined classification; (7) examining the role of genetic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in the resilience to climate change of biocrust communities that are dominated by Syntrichia (with co-occurring mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria) in field and greenhouse experiments."

There is overwhelming evidence that many species have shifted their ranges in the past 30 years as the climate has changed. However, observed range shifts and the results of computer modeling based on the current climatic boundaries of species distributions, both fail to provide a strong enough theoretical foundation for making sound predictions of how future changes will affect these distributions. A mechanistic approach that fuses theory with field experimentation is required to truly understand controls over range distributions. In addition, how plants disperse has not been included in models of range shifts except in rudimentary ways.  Yet dispersal may keep many species from responding to climate change, especially for those native species that occur in isolated pockets of the highly fragmented landscapes of today. This project will address this gap in understanding by using a novel climate change experiment at three prairie sites across a 300 mile climate gradient in the Pacific Northwest. It will also estimate historical and recent rates of dispersal of representative prairie plants using molecular genetics techniques, and computer models that include the effects of climate on the survival, reproduction, and rates of dispersal of these plants. A range of education activities will help high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to develop their professional skills. A web site will be developed to focus on the potential impacts of climate change on regional and global biodiversity. Several nongovernmental conservation organizations will be partners in the research.<br/><br/>This research will be comprised of three coupled tasks. (1) An established manipulative warming and precipitation study that is embedded within a regional climate gradient will be used to experimentally examine the role of climate versus local factors in controlling the demography of a broad suite of 12 native grass and forb species that currently reach northern range limits in the Pacific Northwest. Demographic models will be used to quantitatively determine the relative effect sizes of local factors (e.g., plant community composition and soil variables), regional-scale climate differences, and interannual climate variability on the vital rates of the focal species. (2) Landscape population genetics will be used to determine dispersal probabilities of eight of the focal species in landscapes that face different barriers to dispersal due to both historical and contemporary land use and vegetation, geographic dispersal barriers, and distance between prairie habitat patches. (3) The first two components will be synthesized in a regional landscape simulation under three climate change scenarios within interior-valley prairies in the Pacific Northwest. The simulation model will then be used to predict whether the focal species are likely to go extinct in all or parts of their current ranges, where they are capable of surviving outside of their current ranges under future climatic conditions, and the probability of reaching these new favorable habitats, if they exist. The effects of increased or decreased landscape resistance to dispersal through loss (e.g., increased development pressure) or gain (e.g., increased prairie restoration) of prairie habitat in the future will also be examined."

Although an increasing number of researchers have begun to understand what drives uneven diversity between species, few researchers have examined how differences within single species can affect these broad scale evolutionary patterns. One source of variation lies in the difference between the sexes. The primary goal of this research is to build upon evolutionary theory by examining how sex differences contribute to species and phenotypic diversity. This research fills a critical gap in our understanding of how variation within species may drive larger patterns of species diversity. Through this research program, scientists will contribute to training the next generation of students through their mentorship of high school students through the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP), undergraduate student training in the Small Mammal Undergraduate Research in the Forest (SMURF) program, public talks through the Santa Cruz Public Library, and undergraduate teaching in Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy. <br/><br/>The skulls of musteloids (badgers, otters, raccoons, skunks, and weasels) will be used as a model to examine the effects of sexual dimorphism on phenotypic disparity at the macroevolutionary scale. Musteloids are a taxonomically rich and phenotypically disparate clade whose lineages exhibit uneven patterns of diversity. The researchers will use 3D geometric morphometrics and develop new comparative methods to test the hypothesis [H1a] that incorporating the effects of sex will reveal increased cranial disparity. Males and females in each species are predicted to occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of cranial morphospace; furthermore, the inclusion of both sexes will fill morphospace that was previously unoccupied when the analysis focused on a single sex. The researchers will then quantify the rates of cranial disparity through time in males and females separately and pooled together (species means) to test the hypothesis [H1b] that incorporating sex enhances the pattern of adaptive radiation (i.e. rapid increases in evolutionary rates near ecological opportunity followed by a slowdown in rates). A rate shift in cranial evolution is predicted to occur just after the onset of the Mid-Miocene Climate Transition when using the pooled male and female dataset. Lastly, the researchers will examine an ecological basis for sexual dimorphism by testing the hypothesis [H2] that the degree of carnivory corresponds with the evolution of sexual dimorphism in cranial shape and size across Musteloidea. Therefore, hypercarnivorous musteloids are predicted to exhibit the highest degree of cranial sexual dimorphism. We suspect that this disparity in hypercarnivores is present to mitigate competition between the sexes."

These impacts can ultimately influence the quality of the services that these ecosystems provide to humans (e.g. water quality). Therefore, measuring the rate of forest recovery from disturbance and whether this recovery is predictable are of fundamental importance. The research focuses on the immediate response of the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Maria. El Yunque is the only tropical rain forest in the United States National Forest System and roughly 20% of the population of island relies on El Yunque for water. The research has two primary objectives. The first is to measure the rate and predictability of tree seedling establishment in the year following Maria. The second is to measure how soil fungal pathogens influence seeding establishment following Maria. The research provides a unique opportunity to experimentally investigate how a vital ecosystem responds to a major disturbance. Two graduate students and one undergraduate student, all from underrepresented groups in science, will be supported by this project. Additionally, the PI will offer an R programming short course at the University of Puerto Rico.<br/><br/>Community structure and dynamics are controlled by random and deterministic processes. Determining the relative importance of these processes is of general importance, but particularly important when attempting to predict the response of communities to natural disturbance. This research will first test the hypothesis that community dynamics are functionally deterministic following natural disturbances, but the identity of the species that establish is less predictable. Specifically, the successful establishment of one guild over another is predictable, but which species from that guild will be the representative in the community is less predictable. Next, the research tests the hypothesis that within species negative interactions will be exacerbated post-disturbance due to large numbers of individuals recruiting in the seedling layer. To examine the nature of these negative interactions, the research will consider the phenotypic similarity of individuals and the presence and identities of fungal species in the soil. The research objectives will be met by performing a series of replicated field experiments in El Yunque National Forest, on plots that were established and surveyed in the summer of 2017, before Hurricane Maria. The experiments will be replicated across low elevations in the El Yunque National Forest that vary in their gamma diversity, allowing the research to determine whether gamma diversity influences community predictability."

Thus, in any landscape, animals encounter an arrangement of suitable habitat patches, or stepping-stones, located within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. The spatial arrangement of these stepping-stones is known as a ""habitat network.""  Losses of these stepping-stones stemming from human development and climate change can alter these habitat networks, affecting persistence of the species in the face of rapid climate and landuse change. Wetland habitats in the U.S. Great Plains are embedded within a mixed grassland and agricultural landscape. The Great Plains experiences dramatic year-to-year variability in weather. Climate drives surface processes such as the hydrologic cycle, and hydrology is the most important factor controlling the quality of wetland habitats and the presence of wetland habitat networks. Thus the spatial arrangement of wetland habitat networks in the Great Plains is constantly changing; some wetlands (stepping stones) disappear as others reappear. Land use change adds an additional level of complexity. Increasingly, farmers are converting remnant grasslands in the Great Plains to row crops, with most of this conversion occurring in close proximity to wetlands. This loss of grassland habitat interferes with the ability of some organisms to move between neighboring wetlands, while other species tend to avoid wetlands not surrounded by sufficient grassland cover. This award will use the highly dynamic wetland landscapes in the Great Plains as model systems for exploring general principles related to habitat connectivity. In particular, the funds will allow the PIs to examine how both climate change and land use change will likely influence the connectivity of wetland habitat networks into the next century. This study will focus on two groups, water birds and amphibians, as model organisms that vary widely in their abilities to disperse between wetlands. Methods for quantifying habitat connectivity will be adapted from the study of social networks and a branch of mathematics known as graph theory. Temporal series of wetland condition and land use trends from satellite imagery, computer simulations of wetland hydrology, and downscaled climate change projections will be used to: 1) examine the effects of land use change and climate change on the ability of these two groups of animals to disperse between wetlands, 2) identify barriers to these movements, and 3) identify those wetland habitat networks most likely to persist under projected change<br/><br/>Findings from this study will be used in support of regional conservation planning.

An interdisciplinary team of scientists will investigate the interaction between climate warming and simulated atmospheric N deposition using a long-term, regional-based, field experiment located in a sugar maple-dominated forest ecosystem common over eastern North America.  During the past 18 years, simulated atmospheric nitrogen deposition at rates expected to occur by 2050 have increased tree growth and slowed the decay of dead leaves and roots, increasing the amount of carbon stored in this wide-spread ecosystem.  However, it is uncertain whether carbon storage will attain a higher equilibrium over the long-term as atmospheric nitrogen deposition increases or whether expected warming will counteract this effect.  The proposed research will quantify the amounts of carbon stored in overstory trees, forest floor and soil over the next decade, allowing this team of scientists to test hypotheses regarding the interaction of climate warming and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on ecosystem carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>Using NSF support, this team will continue conducting the annual Global Change Teachers Institute.

Therefore, understanding how evolution acts on duplicate genes will provide key insights into how complex traits and novel forms have arisen. The main goal of this project is to determine the evolutionary forces responsible for the retention of duplicate genes in an organism's genome. The researchers will test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of functional duplicate genes (those that have a new function) is primarily a consequence of natural selection. Scientists have long thought this to be the case, but have never been able to experimentally test this hypothesis. This project uses an innovative method that allows this hypothesis to be tested for the first time. Results will help to understand how organism traits evolve within and among species. The award will have multiple broader impacts on the scientific community by supporting the training of undergraduate and graduate students, development of open source computer software, and dissemination of research findings in open access publications. Additionally, the researchers will design and teach courses on bioinformatics and genomics to local K-12 students at the Science-U camp hosted by Pennsylvania State University each summer. Curricula developed for these courses will also be made freely available on a website for teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will examine the impact of natural selection on duplicate gene functions via both sequence- and expression-level approaches. The researchers recently developed a phylogenetic approach for identifying duplicate genes with novel functions by quantifying differences between their gene expression profiles in closely related species. Application of this method to spatial gene expression profiles in Drosophila revealed that most young duplicates possess new functions, and that acquisition of new functions occurs rapidly. Conversely, in mammals, most young duplicates retain their ancestral functions, and functional divergence occurs more gradually. The contrast in functional divergence rates between duplicate genes in these lineages is reminiscent of the faster sequence-level evolution observed in Drosophila relative to mammals. Researchers will test the hypothesis that natural selection also plays an important role in acquisition of new functions by duplicate genes. Researchers will apply a combination of traditional sequence-based, as well as innovative, expression-based tests for natural selection on duplicate genes. The objectives of these analyses will be to elucidate the role of natural selection in functional divergence of duplicate genes, and to examine differences in selective forces acting on duplicates in populations of different sizes, over evolutionary time, and with varying levels of functional divergence."

This project capitalizes on a readily manipulated host-parasite interaction to elucidate these effects and therefore has significant societal benefits. The recent outbreak of Ebola and the continued emergence of new infectious diseases underscore the importance of understanding how disease transmission is affected by behavior and social networks.  Established contacts with diverse agencies and non-governmental organizations will allow the investigators to share their results to inform the fields of both human and wildlife health. A series of national and international workshops will allow the investigators to disseminate their novel experimental and modeling methods. A code-free, graphical simulation platform is under development that will allow students at all levels to investigate how individual behavior, movement, interspecific interactions, and resource availability affect disease spread. This platform will be taught to individuals with no computer coding experience through workshops, and simpler versions of this platform will be developed for use in secondary school classes. Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be trained in rigorous field and modeling research, with clear plans to recruit students from under-served groups. The research leverages a strong international collaboration between US and Australian researchers, and is jointly supported by NSF's International Science and Engineering Office.<br/><br/>The project takes advantage of a well-studied lizard-tick system to examine how spatial and temporal variation in the ecological and social environments interact with individual differences in host behavioral type to influence individual host movements, host social networks and parasite transmission. While these conceptual links are individually simplistic, each link and their interactions present complexities that require new experimental and modeling approaches. Field research will use habitat surveys to quantify the location of lizard resources and refuges and will track all lizards in a study site to document their movements, space-use, social interactions, and their behavioral tendencies. Sampling will also quantify the number of ticks carried by each lizard. These studies will be complemented by a unique experiment that adds genetically distinct ticks to free-ranging lizards. The experiment will quantify individual differences among lizard hosts in parasite resistance, the relative ability of individuals with different behavioral tendencies to serve as conduits for spreading experimentally-released parasites, and the extent to which increased parasite loads alter host behavior, movement patterns and social interactions.  Empirical results will be integrated in  Bayesian statistical models and individual-based simulation models to test the role of behavioral mechanisms in explaining parasite loads and transmission.  The models will then be used to examine how environmental changes such as shifts in land use regimes or climate alterations will influence host-parasite dynamics."

Recognition of individual appearance in animals can have consequences for choosing a mate, and consequently the trajectory of a species' evolution, as well.  On the one hand, evolution is typically believed to reduce the variation of individual appearance within a species. On the other, evolution has been shown to favor individuality when it promotes recognition.  This project seeks to better understand these seemingly contrasting consequences of evolution through experiments with paper wasps, insects commonly used to study the evolution of behavior.   The research will focus on a paper wasp species with highly individual facial patterns, and investigates how facial variation is encoded in its genes, how it is maintained, and to what extent natural selection favoring individuality contributes to divergence of populations to create new species. This project will also promote science education through a collaboration with the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY and the local state park system.<br/><br/>The proposed work will study the selective and demographic processes shaping patterns of diversity in a uniquely tractable paper wasp. The color patterns of Polistes fuscatus wasps mediate individual recognition among co-nesting queens and show dramatic variation both within and between populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the color pattern diversity in P. fuscatus is the result of selection for individuals to advertise their identity and facilitate recognition. The extreme color pattern diversity, relatively simple genetic architecture of color variation, small genome size and abundant populations make these wasps ideal for addressing fundamental questions regarding the maintenance of phenotypic and genetic diversity in recognition systems. This powerful system will be used to investigate four major topics using a combination of comparative, population and functional genomics approaches coupled with detailed phenotyping of specimens: (1) What is the genetic architecture of individual identity signals? (2) How do phenotypic diversity and genetic architecture interact to determine patterns of genetic diversity? (3) What are the roles of selective and demographic forces in shaping patterns of phenotypic diversity? (4) Does selection on recognition systems lead to the maintenance of variation or rapid turnover in diversity across time and space?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important, therefore, to understand the processes by which bacteria change over time, and to measure the rates of change in their genes and ecological functions. Reseachers at Michigan State University will study evolutionary changes in replicate experimental populations of the bacteria species Escherichia coli, as they evolve in a controlled laboratory environment for thousands of bacterial generations. To measure adaptation, the researchers place the bacteria from later generations in competition with the ancestral strain, which is stored frozen and revived for these experiments. To quantify genetic evolution, the researchers will sequence the genomes of bacteria from many time points and compare them to the ancestor's DNA sequence. These analyses will provide unique information about the rates, mechanisms, effects, and predictability of bacterial evolution. The knowledge gained will benefit both science and society because bacteria are key players in the environment, health, and technology. <br/><br/>This experiment provides a unique study of bacterial evolution by generating exceptionally long time-series of samples from 12 replicate populations, all founded from the same strain of E. coli and maintained in identical environments. The research team will propagate the populations by transferring them every day into fresh medium; every 500 generations, samples are stored frozen, where they remain viable. Over the next decade, the experiment will surpass 85,000 generations. The frozen samples will be used to analyze the dynamics of adaptation by natural selection, the coupling of phenotypic and genetic evolution, and the repeatability of evolutionary changes. Research questions to be addressed include: Will the fitness of the evolving bacteria relative to their ancestor continue to increase indefinitely? Do the trajectories for relative fitness and genomic evolution have similar curvatures, or are they discordant? How repeatable are fitness gains and genomic changes across replicate populations? The biological samples and datasets generated in this project will be shared with the scientific community."

Nitrogen fixation is a process carried out by microorganisms that allows tropical forests to replenish this nutrient. The highest documented nitrogen fixation rates are found in tropical forests, but few measurements have been made in the Amazon Basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest. Phosphorus and molybdenum are two elements that play an important role in the nitrogen fixation process.  Indeed, phosphorus availability is known to limit nitrogen fixation, but no one has determined whether molybdenum has a similar effect in nature.  Because molybdenum is rare, and is easily leached from soils, it's low concentration could lead to low nitrogen fixation rates in the Amazon Basin, where soils are nutrient depleted, and where regions receive little to no new inputs of molybdenum. These so-called ""weathered"" soils in the Amazon Basin are also acidic, and this condition can make it even more difficult for nitrogen-fixing microorganisms to access molybdenum. Research for this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant will investigate how these factors interact to constrain nitrogen fixation, which affects how tropical forests will grow in response to environmental change. <br/><br/>The southeastern Amazon is an understudied but important forest ecosystem where (1) nitrogen fixation has not yet been quantified and (2) where molybdenum and phosphorus concentrations are low, likely due to low atmospheric inputs of these elements. Funds from this award will support experiments to test whether nitrogen fixation by free-living soil microorganisms in the southeastern Amazon is directly constrained by low phosphorus or molybdenum, or indirectly limited via pH effects on phosphorus and molybdenum complexation in soils. The researchers will conduct phosphorus, molybdenum, and lime plot addition experiments, and will measure long-term changes in nitrogen fixation rates and in the availability of phosphorus and molybdenum. Results will be disseminated in review papers for extrapolation of global nitrogen fixation rates for earth system models. In addition, the researchers will train and collaborate with Brazilian students and use the results to develop a teaching module for the annual Expanding Your Horizons workshop for middle school girls interested in science."

Sperm cells that do not carry DNA cannot fertilize an egg, thus the existence of such sperm cells in butterflies and moths is puzzling. Almost all of these insects make two types of sperm: both traditional, DNA-bearing sperm, and a second type that lacks DNA. In all of these cases, males make far more of this DNA-lacking sperm than traditional sperm. The sheer abundance of this sperm type implies it plays some yet-unknown functional role in reproduction. This proposal aims to uncover the evolutionary significance of these DNA-lacking sperm cells. The research will also aid in the development of technologies that will allow scientists to maintain important genetically modified lineages in a way that is both cheaper and less vulnerable to failure than traditional rearing methods. Such protocols could even be extended to threatened species to create a gene bank. Outreach to the public will occur via summer science workshops.<br/><br/>Production of multiple sperm types by a single male has independently arisen in many animal lineages. In all well-studied cases, evidence suggests that only one type of sperm retains its ability to fertilize eggs but the function of these non-fertilizing sperm remains unclear. Nowhere is this more apparent than in butterflies and moths; males of this order produce a secondary sperm type that lacks nuclear DNA. These anucleated cells represent a significant investment for a male, outnumbering their nucleated sperm by 20-to-1, but cannot possibly fertilize eggs to directly increase male fitness. Several hypotheses have been proposed since the discovery of anucleated sperm to explain the existence of anucleated sperm, but to-date no rigorous tests have been undertaken. This project will develop and refine artificial insemination protocols in two lepidopteran species that differ in mating strategy in order to thoroughly test the function of anucleated sperm in different selective backgrounds with a common framework."

Variation in climate, weather, and species interactions can cause variation in the direction and strength of natural selection. Differences in selection across space cause local adaptation. However, whether seasonal, yearly or longer-term fluctuations in selection are equally important for evolution is unknown. Selection that varies over time can cause rapid evolution. It can also erode or maintain variation for individual traits or genes, but may or may not be an important factor in evolutionary dynamics more broadly. Studies of genome-wide variation in natural populations are needed to fill this knowledge gap. In this project, scientists will use computer simulations, experiments, and genome sequencing of butterflies to understand fluctuating selection. The research will focus on how variation in precipitation, temperature, and other factors causes selection on caterpillars to change across space and time. Importantly, new methods will also be developed. These methods will help other scientists investigate the consequences of natural selection on ecological time scales.

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

By elucidating the chemical structure of glomalin (and its variants), this early concept for exploratory research (EAGER) proposal will yield potentially transformative results in the fields of fungal biology and soil science. One postdoctoral scientist and several undergraduate students will also be trained on sophisticated techniques in protein chemistry and fungal biology as part of this exciting and important project.<br/> <br/>The structure of glomalin sensu stricto will be examined in the hyphal biomass of Rhizophagus intraradices as well as in representatives of the genera Glomus, Rhizophagus, Claroideoglomus, Diversispora, Gigaspora, and Acaulospora within the Glomeromycota. Axenic cultures will be grown in a dual compartment system to obtain plant-free hyphal biomass. The cell wall glycoprotein fraction will be subjected to SDS-PAGE and/or 2D gel electrophoresis and the separated bands/spots will be used for structural elucidation. A fraction of each band/spot will be enzymatically deglycosylated to identify the site of the N-glycan followed by HPLC to identify the N-glycan structure, and LC/MS/MS to identify the primary amino acid backbone composition. The O-glycan site and composition will be identified from the LC/MS/MS fragmentation pattern. A second fraction of each band/spot will be used for identifying the occurrence of a GPI-anchor at the C-terminus. We hypothesize that: glomalin sensu stricto in Rhizophagus intraradices is not a single peptide but will consist of multiple peptides with distinct N-, and O-glycosylation patterns, as well as GPI anchoring sites (H1). We further hypothesize (H2) that comparison of glomalin sensu stricto structures between various Glomeromycota genera will reveal a universal backbone of conserved peptide moieties reflecting a single ancestral evolutionary origin in the phylum, and that variations in glycosylation patterns and amino acid sequences identified will reflect the subsequent distinct evolutionary trajectories within various Glomeromycota lineages."

This project extends the book series in several important ways. First, funding will support publication of three new books, one from each of the Hubbard Brook Forest, Plum Island Ecosystem, and the Jornada Experimental Range projects. Second, existing books will be translated into different languages in order to extend their impacts. Third, electronic versions of the books will be developed along with additional instructional materials. By engaging a Series Editor, the project will ensure direct engagement with the education and trade book markets. Familiarity with content delivery trends and new publishing ideas will keep the Series Editor informed and able to be nimble with developing future books. Taken together, these activities will provide a solid foundation for advancement of the educational and outreach goals of the LTER network.<br/><br/>The importance of the project lies primarily in its broader impacts. It will significantly extend the impact of the LTER Schoolyard Book Series by broader sharing of place-based knowledge about ecosystems with elementary school students. The proposed translation of existing books into other languages provides the opportunity to reach a wide diversity of under-served audiences both within the US and around the world. Many local partnerships will be formed to distribute and use these books and to provide professional development to teachers who adopt the books. The series has great potential to help teachers meet Common Core English Language Arts Standards while simultaneously educating students about the natural world and about the profession of scientific research."

The focus is on anthocyanins (the blue to red pigments that are the most important contributors of color in flowers). Cutting edge DNA sequencing approaches will be used to study the plant biochemical pathways that produce anthocyanins. These results will be placed in an evolutionary context to understand what happens when, for example, purple flowers evolve from red-flowered ancestors. The phylogeny or family tree of Ruellia will be reconstructed using novel molecular markers to be developed for this project; these markers will subsequently be useful to numerous other researchers. <br/><br/>Flowers are among the most common means by which people connect to nature: floral biology has great potential to engage broad audiences in science. This research is also important because it will shed light on the anthocyanins biochemical pathway. Anthocyanins contribute to numerous plant functions (e.g., pollinator and fruit disperser attraction, UV sunscreen, herbivore defense), and have also been linked to human health benefits (e.g., anti-cancer, -viral, -inflammatory, -arteriosclerosis activity; treatments for hypertension, vision disorders). Anthocyanins are common constituents of human diets, being found in frequently consumed fruits and vegetables. This research project will add substantially to knowledge of the genetic basis of anthocyanin production and will thus have implications for human health research."

The sequential order and timing of physical changes during this window plays a key role in the healthy functioning of seasonally snow-covered ecosystems. The vernal window is shorter following cold, snowy winters but lengthens when winters are warmer and snow packs are shallow or melt multiple times through the winter. When the vernal window gets longer, it can lead to a mismatch in the timing of key ecosystems processes. For example, earlier snowmelt in the spring can flush nutrients from soils before trees emerge from dormancy, preventing trees from accessing those vital nutrients during early spring growth. The vernal window is expected to lengthen given documented warming trends in winter climate, and, under higher emission scenarios may be eliminated altogether in more southerly locations. This study will integrate observations of snow, streamflow, and forest health to document historical changes in the length of the vernal window and use simulations to project future changes in the vernal window. Results will be use to assess the impact on key energy, water, and carbon transitions on ecosystem function, using the northeastern United States forests as a testbed. In collaboration with a local high school classroom, the investigators will develop a low-cost instrumentation suite constructed by students through an inquiry-based lab course that will allow students to track changes in the vernal window in their school yards. A Next Generation Science Standard compliant curriculum with units on energy balance, the carbon cycle, and hydrology will accompany the instrument kit, laying the groundwork for outdoor classroom inquiry on the environment. <br/><br/>Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of winter coldness or snowpack as drivers of spring onset, however, it remains unclear how antecedent winter temperature and snowpack properties interact to influence the timing and duration of the vernal window. In addition, previous work has not investigated explicitly how biogeochemical asynchronies that result from longer lags between transitions in the longer vernal window can impact ecosystem function, which is essential for understanding the impact of environmental change.  Rapid changes in winter conditions could lead to vernal asynchronies that have strong potential to alter energy, water, and carbon balances. The most extreme case is a shift into a snow-free regime in which the vernal window ceases to exist and is replaced by a prolonged period of increased net radiation into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems between senescence and leaf out that may fundamentally alter ecosystem function. The work proposed here brings together large existing datasets and process-based models that will be used to investigate explicitly 1) the relative importance of winter coldness and snowpack in altering the vernal window; 2) how longer vernal lags and windows impact ecosystem energy, water, and carbon balance; and 3) how future winter coldness and snowpack characteristics might lead to additional changes in the vernal window. The outcome of this process will be a regional, 30-year historical analysis of changes to energy, carbon, and water balances during the vernal window. Insight gained from this historical analysis will provide the ability to project future changes in not only vernal window length, but also the impact of changing energy, carbon, and water balances during the vernal window on ecosystem function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The area of forests is also being greatly reduced in the Amazon basin by deforestation.  Because trees play such an important role in regulating the climate near the ground, losing trees to massive die offs or deforestation also means changes in that microclimate.  With enough tree die off and large enough reductions in the area forested, the effects of tree loss on microclimates may add together and begin to affect  the climate at much larger scales (or macro-climate).  Recent results from computer models that link climate and forest cover have shown that a large increase in the area of forests in North America actually led to locally warmer conditions and also caused three global scale climate effects: it increased the amount of energy exchanged between the northern and southern hemispheres, it shifted the band of tropical rainfall (known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone), and it increased drought in the Amazon basin of South America.  This raises the concern that decreases in the area forested, which could be caused by either die off or deforestation, could also have important effects both globally as well as locally. In particular, this could link the fates of forests in North America and South America through a so-called climate teleconnection. To address this, this project will use a model that predicts how forests respond to climate to evaluate the effects of large scale decreases in forest area from die off and deforestation in North and South America. To do this, measurements related to how decreases in forested area affects the microclimate near the ground will be made at a series of field sites in both regions.  <br/><br/>This project will provide important information about how decreases in forest area in one hemisphere could affect climate conditions not only locally but also in the other hemisphere.  To find and explore the boundaries of the potential range of responses that could occur in the future, the assessment will evaluate extreme conditions where all forests are removed and then the consequences of actual recent decreases in forested area.  The project will also provide key information on which factors in the models are the most important to accurately measure in order to improve predictions.  Because scientists are uncertain about what conditions massive trigger tree die offs, the project will also provide important information about the reasons for tree death and the expected in climate that might result.  Overall, the project will provide science results that can aide in developing policy.  It will also build a strong collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian scientists.  Finally, the project will train postdoctoral scholars and inform the public and teachers through use of the Biosphere 2 facility in Tucson, where more than 100,000 members of the public  visit each year."

While some marsh losses result from coastal development, others losses have yet to be fully explained. Marshes can build soil vertically and gain elevation to keep pace with slowly rising seas, but the marsh plants that sustain these ecosystems get stressed when sea level rises too quickly. The amount of sea level a marsh can tolerate depends on other factors that are also changing. For instance, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising. Likewise, pollution from nutrients like nitrogen has increased sharply from preindustrial times. Both increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen tend to make marsh plants grow more, which could help marshes keep up with sea level rise. But they also change the types of plants that grow and it is unknown what effects that will have on marshes. This project asks: how will rising carbon dioxide and nitrogen affect plants and the ability of coastal marshes to keep up with sea level rise? Since about half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coastline, there is considerable pressure on coastal wetlands and the services they provide. The annual loss of low-lying coastal wetlands lost to open water each year threatens fisheries, wildlife habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. The project will also continue public education and science education programs at many levels, and the research results will be made freely available on a public Smithsonian Institution website. <br/><br/>To address the central question of this project, the study builds on a thirty-year history of ecological observations at a Chesapeake Bay marsh in Maryland. Measurements of primary production and soil chemistry will be combined with parallel experiments that simulate the future environment by adding carbon dioxide and nitrogen to marsh plots, and comparisons will be made of native to invading plants. The long-term records of this site enable the scientists to document changes in the species composition of plants growing on the marsh over time. At this point, the surface elevation of the soil in the marsh is falling behind local sea level rise, suggesting that this marsh may be in the process of collapsing. The investigators will continue their local measurements, but the results should be generally applicable to coastal wetlands everywhere."

Identification of the sister group and divergence time of the Sri Lankan Polyspora lineage will provide a context for diversification within Sri Lanka and address longstanding questions on the number, delimitation, and geographic distribution of genera in Thecae that will provide a framework for future floristic and taxonomic work in the family.  A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis of 120 Polyspora accessions will be used to provide a fine-scale test of geographic structure within Sri Lanka. This phylogeographic analysis will then be used to clarify species limits within the genus and provide a context for future studies on speciation."

This research will investigate a striking case in a group of trees and shrubs (Viburnum) in which rapid differentiation appears to have occurred repeatedly into two radically different plant forms. Major differences in the leaves of these plants appear to have resulted from adaptation to adjacent forest types that differ subtly in environmental variables. The evident replication of this process in several different mountain regions throughout the New World tropics, provides a rare opportunity to critically test a model of rapid ecological speciation. Detailed studies of adjacent plant populations will be carried out in different mountain regions in Mexico with the aim of identifying the environmental factors and the nature of the variation within populations that have favored the rapid evolution of these leaf traits. It should also be possible to identify genes that underlie these key plant characteristics by taking advantage of natural hybridization between these species. These studies will yield general insights into speciation but also into the adaptive significance of the leaf traits that differentiate related species throughout the flowering plants. This research will be carried out in collaboration with Mexican scientists and will involve multiple undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities have been designed to foster interactions between participants from the United States and Mexico.  <br/><br/>This project focuses specifically on understanding the drivers of speciation in three species pairs in the mountains of Eastern and Southern Mexico. The two species in each pair differ dramatically in leaf size and shape (large and round versus small and elliptical), in leaf margins (toothed versus smooth), and in leaf pubescence (densely hairy versus lacking hairs). The research will focus on quantifying variation within individual plants, within populations, and between the species pairs, and on determining the abiotic and biotic factors that differ between their forest habitats. Hypotheses on the adaptive value of the leaf variables will be tested using transects between adjacent habitats and a reciprocal transplant experiment.  In areas that have long been disturbed by indigenous agricultural practices, extensive hybridization has resulted in a wide array of intermediate leaf forms.  Molecular analyses of these hybrid swarms should allow the identification of the major genes that underlie differences in leaf form. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering."

Plants that live where fire occurs frequently are often capable of surviving fires. Some of these plants produce fuels that change the likelihood and characteristics of future fires, producing conditions favorable to them and/or their offspring. Soil organisms also affect plant fuels, and some are capable of surviving fires. They represent an important but unrecognized driver capable of altering fuels and future fires, especially in habitats with frequent fires. Soil fungi are a key example of such soil organisms, directly affecting fuel loads by decomposing dead plant tissues and indirectly affecting fuel production through their effects on plant growth. Because fungi differ in fire susceptibility, repeated fires may shape the fungi present, altering direct and indirect effects on fuels (and thus future fires). Knowledge of these fungal effects is important for managing natural fire-frequented habitats such as savannas and grasslands and forecasting the characteristics (such as the likelihood and intensity) of future fires in most terrestrial habitats. This research examines how changes in fires (severity, frequency, suppression) influence fungi and their effects on new fuels, both directly through fuel breakdown and indirectly through plants, then models how these differences may affect future fires. This research will also develop two educational modules on fire, fungi and plants: 1) undergraduate students will test different fire traits of cultured fungi and 2) K-5 classrooms will use inquiry-based learning kits that are developed on fire, fungi and plants, and that directly address next generation science standards. <br/> <br/>The research will be conducted in pine savannas, highly diverse and threatened southeastern habitats dependent on frequent fire. Initial research showed that fire alters soil fungi and results in 40% slower decomposition by microbes of dead plant leaves newly deposited on the ground. Slower decomposition causes fuels to accumulate more quickly in the environment, increasing chances and intensities of future fires. This research uses large-scale field experiments with fire, next generation DNA sequencing, and computer modeling to determine how soil microbes like fungi respond to fire, and if they play an unrecognized role by influencing likelihoods and characteristics of future fires. Because these effects are tested over a spectrum of fire severities, the model based on experimental results can be used in other pyrogenic habitats and can be used to forecast likelihoods and effects of future fires."

Human activities that shift communities, such as ecosystem degradation and restoration, have the potential to alter ecosystem processes.  This project will examine how management actions in a restored grassland shape the species and trait compositions of plant and animal communities and the ecosystem processes that these species drive.  Results will provide guidance on how land managers can maximize the benefits of ecosystems to nature and to society.  Collaborations with the research site managers will allow education and outreach opportunities to members of the public who visit the site, including class field trips, and the project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the practice and communication of science.  <br/><br/>This project will examine the community and ecosystem function consequences of changes in environmental context resulting from three landscape-scale management actions:  reintroduction of megaherbivore grazers (bison), large predator removal, and application of prescribed fires in restored tallgrass prairies.  It will advance knowledge of community-trait-function relationships by including consumers in interactions spanning entire food webs and expanding to a relevant landscape scale.  Researchers will measure both traits and ecosystem function changes resulting from management actions in two food web modules.  The first module includes plants and herbivores (insect and small mammal) and their impacts on primary productivity and litter decomposition through changes in plant traits and herbivore foraging specialization and the degree to which herbivores use a wide variety of food resources (niche breadth) as measured by stable isotopes.  The second module is dung decomposers and their effects on soil processes (carbon and nitrogen cycling and decomposition rates) through changes in morphology, foraging strategies, and phenology.  Results will reveal how the trait composition of communities mediates the relationship between environmental context and ecosystem function.  Ultimately this research will lay the groundwork for studies manipulating the species- and trait-composition of consumer communities.  Further, by performing this work in a restored system and in concert with managers, it helps close the loop between researchers and natural resource managers."

Although the group is evolutionarily quite young, there are over 250,000 species of flowering plants. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that reciprocal adaptation between plants and their pollinators (a process known as coevolution) is responsible for the spectacular number of species of flowering plants, but evidence supporting this idea is circumstantial. This project tests this hypothesis by measuring coevolution between yuccas and yucca moths. The yucca / yucca moth interaction is widely referred to as a model system for studying coevolution, but no study has ever conclusively demonstrated coevolution between them. This project will use experimental manipulations of yuccas and yucca moths to determine whether the plants and their pollinators are adapting to one another. Genomic technologies will identify genetic factors associated with plant and pollinator features and determine whether they are coevolving. Finally, genetic tools will be used to determine whether coevolution was involved in the evolution of new species of yuccas and yucca moths. <br/><br/>This project provides one of the first direct tests of the hypothesis that coevolution promotes the evolution of new species, and will significantly advance our understanding of how the diversity of life originated.

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, multiple hypotheses link the latitudinal diversity gradient to a presumed gradient in the strength of biotic interactions between temperate and tropical environments. While biotic interactions are believed to play a major role in the origin and maintenance of diversity and may drive increased rates of adaptation and speciation in tropical regions, this hypothesis remains virtually untested.

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

Since an early divergence from other land plants some 450 million years ago, mosses took a different path than vascular plants to solving the challenges to survival and reproduction posed by terrestrial environments. One important trait that is well developed in mosses is the capability of drying without dying, known as desiccation tolerance (DT). This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress. Specific methods to be employed include: (1) sequencing the full genomes of S. caninervis and S. ruralis; (2) using next generation sequencing (NGS) to develop genotypic markers for population-level genetic variation studies, signature transcriptome tools for phenotypic analyses (related to ecophysiological and ecosystem investigations), and multiple single-copy genes for phylogenetic analysis; (3) transcriptomics experiments comparing different development stages and sexes of both species in response to desiccation stress and reproductive state; (3) ecophysiological experiments on multiple populations of S. caninervis and S. ruralis, and all 15 species of N.

Biologists seek to understand how particular traits of organisms---the size of an animal or the flower color of a plant, for example---affect the chances of giving rise to a new species or suffering extinction. This project develops computational tools to help identify traits that consistently affect speciation and extinction. It further applies the tools to understand the history of particular plant groups, including ones with agriculturally and economically valuable species. Undergraduate science opportunities and mentoring specifically target veterans of the armed services. A workshop and individual advising will equip young researchers with technical skills that are valuable for a variety of future careers. The international collaboration between American and Israeli labs will train students and postdoctoral researchers and hold workshops to build communities of young scientists working with phylogenetic comparative methods.<br/><br/>Inferring trait-dependent lineage diversification from phylogenetic trees is difficult. There is currently a need for methods that are both powerful and reliable, and for tools to distinguish when methods perform well or poorly. In this project, two novel modeling techniques target weaknesses recently revealed in current methods. The first incorporates sequence evolution into models of trait evolution, to allow shifts in diversification rate to be explained by processes at both those levels. The second focuses on connections between diversification and trait shifts, rather than their values, to avoid the statistical problem of pseudoreplication. Two computational tools provided by this project improve the usage of existing and future methods. One is a community-driven database of benchmark tests to compare how methods perform across diverse scenarios. The other is a means of assessing model adequacy, to guide confidence in empirical conclusions and directions for future model development. Finally, this project investigates the macroevolutionary dynamics of two traits that have major effects on plant phenotypes and genotypes: breeding system and whole genome duplication. Methodological advances and expanded datasets provide the potential to make the strongest cases yet for the importance of species selection in shaping biodiversity."

These interaction networks have long fascinated biologists, who are interested in why some species depend on each other and in how these relationships matter for maintenance of biodiversity. For example, why do most insects that eat plants consume only a few types of plants in any one location? And, how did it happen that many of these insects depend on beneficial microbes (fungi and bacteria) that are found nowhere else except with those insects. This project will explore how such specialized interactions arise.  Specifically, researchers will investigate the evolution of new interactions among insects, microbes, and an economically important plant (alfalfa) in western North America.  By identifying the key factors that underlie the insect-microbe-plant interactions in this study system, the research will fill a substantial gap in our understanding of the diversity of life, and enhance our ability to predict how global change will affect biological diversity and ecosystem function. The researchers will also engage and collaborate with the public through a discovery-based citizen science program, and will develop new analytical tools to benefit other scientists who are interested in how species come to depend on each another.<br/><br/>This project examines a complex network of interacting biodiversity, including macroscopic and microscopic organisms, to answer a fundamental question: What role does biodiversity play in the evolution and maintenance of novel interactions? The research team takes advantage of a well-studied plant-insect-microbe system to investigate the importance of multiple layers of inter- and intra-specific diversity for predicting the evolution of novel interactions, specifically the colonization of alfalfa by the Melissa blue butterfly and microbes. The project combines a systems approach to biological complexity with manipulations that allow the researchers to integrate three focal dimensions of biodiversity: (1) functional diversity, encompassing how variation in phytochemistry, larval performance, and butterfly egg-laying preference are shaped by microbial, fungal, plant and caterpillar interactions; (2) genetic diversity, including the role of genomic variation within and among populations of interacting plants and insects, both in the wild and in an experiment context; and (3) phylogenetic diversity, focusing on gut bacteria in insects, as well as fungal and bacterial endophytes in plants."

This project brings a new perspective to this problem by suggesting that environmental conditions in between the isolated pieces might change conditions within a piece and influence the rate of species loss. The research focuses on bee pollinators - organisms that provide essential services to human society, are critical to US agriculture, and are important targets for conservation. If conditions between isolated pollinator patches improve pollinator performance within a patch, then conservation of these important organisms may not be as difficult as it seems. The leader of this project is an early-career African American woman who has tremendous promise both as a research and a role model in science. Both the research and its location in the Ozarks will provide many opportunities for undergraduates to initiate independent projects, engaging in each step of the scientific process. Research results will be used to engage middle-school girls through a Girls Explore Biology summer camp that is dedicated to recruiting under-served groups. Last but not least, results will be shared with the Missouri Department of Conservation to advance national bee conservation efforts. <br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is one of the global drivers of species losses; it alters species abundance and diversity by reducing habitat size and connectivity. Changes in species richness with fragment size are expected based on species-area relationships but questions remain about why these relationships are so variable. The habitat surrounding a site (the matrix) can be important in determining fragment species diversity, but little is known about how matrix quality affects diversity. The research will focus on three questions: Does matrix quality affect resource availability and use? Does matrix quality alter pollinator movement between fragments? Does matrix quality affect pollinator species traits within fragments? Preliminary results suggest that both plant and pollinator abundance and diversity are highly dependent on matrix quality in the study area, the Missouri Ozark Glades. To address the research questions, nesting rates for ground-nesting bees and nesting resource availability in the matrix at different distances from a fragment will be estimated. Bees will be marked with oil-based paint and recaptured along transects in the matrix and in the nearest glade fragments. Results will estimate movement of bees under different conditions. Lastly, bee morphological traits will be analyzed to determine which types of bees (based on traits) are more likely to be threatened by low quality matrix. This is important because larger and more mobile bee species may facilitate pollen dispersal, stabilizing plant communities and fragment quality."

This project extends that work to include effects of governmental policies and social attitudes on the use of fire to keep grasslands open, and to include the impacts of conversion between grassland and woodland on ecological services and resultant economics. Researchers will compare three regions with contrasting degrees of woody encroachment in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to test the hypothesis that changes between grassland and woodland are driven by interactions between fire and grazing regimes that are constrained by policy and culture.

Environmental microbial communities provide essential functions, including the cycling of key resources like carbon and nitrogen. In soils, microorganisms form diverse communities with thousands of distinct species, but the role of most of these species is unknown. In particular, it is not clear how microbial species that are not very abundant (rare) contribute to community functions. However, rare microorganisms are thought to be important when environmental conditions fluctuate because they provide functions that help their ecosystem resist change or to recover quickly. This project will investigate the diversity and functions of rare microorganisms in a soil ecosystem impacted by a long-term disturbance, and determine how they contribute to the system's resilience to this disturbance. The research will provide insights into the critical role of microbial diversity for environmental resilience, which has implications for broad national interests in energy and food security, environmental conservation and remediation, and the management of ecosystem services. The project will advance the fields of ecology and ecosystem science by investigating the links between microbial diversity and functions in the environment. It also will benefit society by providing classroom education in quantitative methods and training members of the scientific workforce in leading-edge technologies used in biology and chemistry.<br/><br/>The three aims of this research are to: 1) quantify the contributions of rare microbial taxa to community stability after a long-term environmental disturbance; 2) evaluate the abilities of rare microbial taxa to a) persist given disturbance and b) respond to specific environmental changes that result from the disturbance; and 3) determine the impact of competition between rare and abundant microbial taxa on community stability and functions. The Centralia, Pennsylvania soil ecosystem is the site of a long-burning coal seam fire that will serve a model severe disturbance for this work. For Aims 1 and 2, surface soils will be collected annually from established sites along a fire-impact gradient so that community changes over time due to the influence of fire can be quantified. Soil microbial communities will be assessed using genetic markers of phylogenetic and functional diversity obtained from untargeted DNA and RNA sequencing. Rare microbial taxa will be identified using bioinformatics and their contributions to community stability will be quantified with ecological statistics. For Aim 3, bacteria isolated from field soils will be arrayed into synthetic microbial communities to assess outcomes of competition between rare and abundant microorganisms. Microbial community ""goods"", which include small, excreted molecules like enzymes and antibiotics, will be measured using sensitive mass spectrometry to determine how competition impacts their production. Together, these efforts will provide insights into the ecological roles of rare microbial taxa, and microbial biodiversity more broadly, for community stability and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a topic of great scientific and societal importance.  Healthy soils have hordes of tiny, beneficial microorganisms that access and recycle the building blocks of life, including nutrients and carbon, and make them available to the next generation of plants. Beneficial soil microorganisms form intricate relationships with plants, supporting crop growth and productivity. Although they comprise some of the most biologically diverse communities on Earth, many details regarding the ways which microorganisms help maintain soil health and promote plant growth remain mysterious. For example, how do microbial communities cope with variations in the water and chemical content of soil, which can change drastically over small distances? This research project will use state-of-the-art methods and recently developed x-ray technology to examine soil micro-scale properties including the number and size of soil pores, pH, and nutrient and carbon quality and availability.  These measurements will be coupled with high through-put genome sequencing to examine the impact of these properties on microbial diversity and soil health. This project will serve national interests through advancing fundamental knowledge about the roles that microorganisms play to support soil health, food security and agriculture. The project will also advance the field of soil ecosystem science, and will support education and workforce training through authentic laboratory research opportunities for undergraduates.<br/><br/>The relationship between spatial heterogeneity of soil micro-habitats and microbial diversity will be investigated by dissecting precise physical and chemical micro-environmental variables and the structure and function of their associated microorganisms.

This research offers a fundamentally new approach of combining synchrotron-based X-ray computed micro-tomography information with microbial metagenomics to achieve an improved understanding of the role that physical micro-environmental conditions play in determining compositional and functional diversity of soil microbial communities. This study will pioneer quantitative, combined analysis of key elements important for microbial functioning, including the architecture and characteristics of soil pores, their relationship to micro-biogeographic patterns in microbial structure, and spatial micro-biogeographic patterns that emerge given associations with plant roots. One unique feature of the project is that observed spatial patterns of micro-habitats will be studied with specific reference to local characteristics of soil pores (""geo-referencing""), which are the avenues enabling air, water, and nutrient fluxes and soil microbial migration.

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle.

Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

Through generations of breeding to increase yield, crop plants have been selected for a variety of branching patterns that change the number, length or angle of branches. In maize, leaf angle has been an important branching trait that has likely contributed to increasing corn yields. The angle of the leaf is determined by the ligule region, which forms at the boundary between the blade and sheath. The blade tilts back to absorb energy from the sun while the sheath holds tight to the stem. This angle between the blade and sheath is a heritable trait that can be modified through selection: decreased angle makes plants more upright for more compact fields, whereas increased angle optimizes the surface area of the blade for more energy capture. Thus, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms involved in establishing the leaf angle will provide new tools for manipulating maize architecture. This project aims to clarify the complex network of factors that determine when and how the ligule region forms. This project will first identify and characterize the expression of genes that define the ligule boundary during the earliest stages of development. Molecular, genetic and genomic methods will then be used to investigate how the ligule region forms. The results will be shared with diverse audiences including breeders, the scientific community and with students. To that end, YouTube videos will be produced that describe the science of corn development to a general audience and additional educational materials will be generated for student classrooms. All resources will be made publically available through lab websites and the maize community website (http://www.maizegdb.org).  <br/><br/>This project investigates how the ligular region is established as a defined organ boundary in the undifferentiated leaf primordium. Previous work used the anatomically distinct ligule as a site for transcriptome analysis: preligule, preblade and presheath cells were clearly identified for laser capture followed by RNA sequencing. Due to the specificity of capture, a collection of candidate genes was identified that is uniquely and differentially expressed in the ligule region. Shared expression patterns in other organ boundaries suggest that the ligule reiterates the lateral organ initiation program that occurs at the shoot apical meristem and at tassel branch boundaries. Thus, distinctly different organ boundaries are hypothesized to share genes and use common mechanisms to define and restrict developmental pathways. To test this hypothesis, gene networks will be established for early stages of ligule development and mechanisms of ligule initiation further investigated. The first specific aim is to identify the earliest determinants of ligule formation by capturing cells from the youngest accessible leaf primordia. Candidate genes will be prioritized based on their expression in other ligule-specific mutants. The second aim investigates three promising candidate gene pathways that support the role of KNOTTED1 (KN1)-like homeobox transcription factors and partner proteins in establishing the ligule boundary. Mutants will be analyzed in these genes for ligule and branching phenotypes.  The third aim tests the hypothesis that the bZIP transcription factor LIGULELESS2 (LG2), bound by KN1, is involved in positioning the blade/sheath boundary. Protein partners will be identified as will down-stream targets to determine the role of LG2 in establishing the blade sheath boundary."

Members of the Agaricomycotina have profound impacts on the functioning of ecosystems through their activities as decayers, pathogens, and beneficial symbionts. Researchers who study members of the Agaricomycotina include medical mycologists, plant pathologists, biofuels researchers, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists. However, such activities are often hampered by the lack of a coherent evolutionary and taxonomic framework for Agaricomycotina. In addition to professional scientists, many members of the public are interested in mushrooms, which they may collect for food, dyes, or as art objects. Amateur mycologists use field guides that are organized according to the physical forms of the mushrooms (e.g., gilled mushroom, polypores, coral fungi, etc.), but these often do not reflect evolutionary relationships. Consequently, amateur mycologists fail to appreciate the genealogical groupings of Agaricomycotina, or the rationale for taxonomic name changes when they occur. In this project,  25 years of work on the Agaricomycotina will be synthesized to produce two books on the subject. One will be a technical publication on ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"" for professional scientists and graduate students. ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"" will enable scientists from diverse backgrounds to gain an overview of the diversity and evolutionary relationships of mushroom-forming fungi, and promote comparative perspectives in basic and applied fungal science. The other book will be a popular text, titled ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life"" for amateur mycologists. ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life"" will show how evolutionary trees are estimated and help amateur mycologists make connections between field guides and the technical literature in fungal systematics.<br/><br/>This work will result in a comprehensive scientific summary text and a popular text for the public.  The first, entitled ""Systematics of Agaricomycotina"", will include five chapters on general topics, including (1) History of phylogenetics of Agaricomycotina; (2) Overview of phylogeny and diversity of Agaricomycotina; (3) Character bases of systematics of Agaricomycotina; (4) Morphological and developmental evolution in Agaricomycotina; and (5) Ecological diversity and evolution of nutritional modes in Agaricomycotina; as well as eleven chapters (6-16) describing individual groups of Agaricomycotina. The popular text, ""Mushrooms in the Tree of Life,"" will be organized in three parts: (1) ""Reconstructing the tree of life"", which will contain a concise primer of fungal phylogenetics, with minimal jargon; (2) ""Mushrooms in the tree of life"", which will present a higher-level phylogenetic framework for mushroom-forming fungi, emphasizing groups that are familiar to amateur mycologists; and (3) ""Stories from the tree of life"", which will contain a series of evolutionary vignettes about mushrooms, illustrating historical narratives that can only be addressed with a phylogenetic perspective."

In 1996, ESA launched the first phase of a new program, called Strategies for Ecology Education, Diversity and Sustainability (SEEDS), intentionally designed to retain underrepresented minority undergraduate students in the field of ecology through intensive mentoring at the individual and small group levels.  Since then SEEDS has grown and expanded to include field trips to ecological research sites, a leadership workshop, a research fellowship program, and partnerships with other organizations and networks.  Over 500 minority students have been served by SEEDS over the years. The current project is Phase IV of SEEDS and is based on results of an independent program evaluation in 2014. In this phase a set of structured workshops and conferences will be integrated into a sequence of activities that build upon previous student experiences and a designed support infrastructure. Three dimensions of experience and support, personal, cultural and institutional, are interwoven during and between proposed program activities.  SEEDS students will work with mentors to identify opportunities in five areas that will help them advance in science careers: research experiences, skills workshops, presentations at  scientific meetings, community projects, and completed LinkedIn profiles and active participation in social media.<br/><br/>SEEDS ecology field experiences serve primarily freshmen and sophomores or those who have no prior research background.  In this way, students are introduced to ecology earlier in their undergraduate careers and motivated to consider the wide variety of research and career options available.  Travel awards to ESA annual meetings support more advanced students who aspire to careers in ecology by more fully integrating them into the large family of professional ecologists. New dimensions in Phase IV include increased support for the development of SEEDS chapters at institutions across the U.S., formal partnerships with specific field-based research organizations and networks, and longer-term mentoring of individual SEEDS students. SEEDS is a cohesive, focused and future-looking program, critically important for enhancing the participation of under-represented groups where agency support, and real progress, has historically been weak."

Climate change is one such disturbance that is expected to result in a re-organization of global biodiversity, including shifts in species geographic distribution and increases in rates of extinctions.  Alterations in local species populations may impact the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide for humans. However, natural ecosystems might prove more resilient that we think if species better adapted to new climates can immigrate or if local populations can adapt to the changes. In this project, researchers will manipulate entire ponds to understand the degree to which these ecosystems are resilient to the climate-induced expansion of a top aquatic predator. As winters warm, the marbled salamander is rapidly colonizing newly suitable temporary ponds in New England. Marbled salamanders are top predators in these ponds and can strongly reduce biodiversity and shift pond ecosystems to a state characterized by high algal production. The project will have broader impacts on society beyond contributing to fundamental science and conservation. The investigators will create a scientific internship for K-12 teachers and an undergraduate internship focusing on students from underrepresented groups.  They will also develop a system of linked remote video cameras to record and broadcast the annual amphibian migration, as a means of public outreach.<br/><br/>In a region where climate change is promoting the rapid expansion of a top predator, the investigators will quantify how immigration and adaptive evolution facilitate ecological and evolutionary rescue. The work will focus on ecological resilience originating from the immigration of species that can restore diversity and replace lost functional roles and the adaptive evolution of an intermediate consumer previously shown to mediate the impacts of the apex predator on community structure. The project advances fundamental and applied questions by 1) performing one of the first tests of resilience theory in parallel, repeated, whole-ecosystem experiments; 2) allowing a comparison of ecological versus evolutionary mechanisms of resilience; 3) challenging the existing paradigm that predictions about biotic responses can ignore landscape connectivity and adaptive variation; 4) initiating an important long-term study on evolution in wild vertebrates; and 5) developing a generalizable understanding of how apex predators alter freshwater systems as they expand in a warming world. The project takes a multi-tiered approach in order to develop insights about two fundamental responses to predator introductions across space and time to contribute to building a broader, more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary resistance to food web changes."

Since an early divergence from other land plants some 450 million years ago, mosses took a different path than vascular plants to solving the challenges to survival and reproduction posed by terrestrial environments. One important trait that is well developed in mosses is the capability of drying without dying, known as desiccation tolerance (DT). This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress.

As ranges move to higher altitudes, important interactions between species may be disrupted, with as yet unknown consequences. The coupled dynamics arising from species interactions can produce complex and unanticipated ecological responses to climate change. Novel species responses may feed back on the rate of climate change itself by altering processes that influence carbon cycling.<br/>Fungal symbionts of plants, such as endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi, are now well documented to influence the resilience of plants to climate change. Fungi also play critical roles in carbon cycling, by storing carbon in recalcitrant forms and decomposing organic material. Therefore, the potential for climate change to decouple plant and fungal interactions deserves careful attention. While plant movement under changing climates is easily observed, movement of fungal species is inconspicuous and little studied.  This project will gauge the potential for plant-fungal symbioses to become destabilized under future climates and test the consequences of disruptions for individual plant species and carbon cycling.<br/>This project has four major components. First, the distributions of fungal symbionts colonizing plant leaves and roots will be described along replicated elevation gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, using microscopy and DNA sequencing. This work constitutes the largest altitudinal survey of fungal symbionts anywhere in the world. Second, an NSF-funded, 22-year long warming experiment will be leveraged to test, for the first time, whether fungal responses to climate warming match their distributional patterns along natural, altitudinal gradients. Third, reciprocal transplants of plants and fungi will mimic range shifts under a 3C warmer climate and experimentally test the consequences of symbiosis decoupling. Fourth, functional assays will evaluate how disrupted symbioses affect carbon cycling. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  A majority of the budget is allocated to training the next generation of scientists, including students from underrepresented groups at the University of New Mexico, a majority-minority institution.

This research will be incorporated into a wildlife course with 150 students per year by creating new inquiry-based labs using photos from carcass sites. In addition, this study will involve Alaska Native students in field and lab research in partnership with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program, and video vignettes about carnivore ecology will be created in partnership with Symbio Studios to reach 2 million K-12 students per year for 5-7 years.<br/><br/>This study will examine the movements and population dynamics of two common mesopredators, coyotes and bobcats, as part of a new collaborative study of wolves, cougars, deer, and elk in northern Washington. Wolves are naturally recolonizing Washington, creating a mosaic of variation in large carnivore presence. A powerful combination of animal-borne GPS and video tracking technology, stable isotope enrichment of carcasses, fecal genotyping, and cameras at kill sites will be used to jointly examine positive and negative relationships among carnivores. The researcher hypothesizes that scavenging is a critical yet overlooked factor determining mortality risk for mesopredators, creating hotspots of negative species interactions across the landscape. Carrion may thus present a ""fatal attraction"" whereby local-scale clustering of competing carnivores leads to landscape-scale suppression of subordinate mesopredators. Coyotes and bobcats will be used to test this hypothesis, because they differ strongly in their scavenging activity but are otherwise ecologically similar."

Bsal is a flesh-eating pathogen that causes necrotic skin ulcerations and can lead to death in susceptible salamanders in less than 2 weeks. Emergence of this pathogen in the United States would have devastating effects on biodiversity. Eastern North America is home to more than 100 salamander species that contribute to various ecosystem services, including control of disease-causing insects, nutrient cycling, and biomedical products for society. This award will fund research that will characterize the epidemiology, host immune responses, and pathogenesis of Bsal in one of the most widely distributed salamander species in North America, the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens). By taking a proactive approach to studying Bsal now, this project will generate essential information aimed at developing predictive disease response tools that can be used by natural resource organizations to prevent or thwart an outbreak of Bsal in North America. Additionally, this project will provide broad training opportunities and capacity building for students and professionals at US academic institutions, agencies and organizations. <br/><br/>The current knowledge of Bsal epidemiology is restricted mostly to European fire salamanders, which have different life history strategies than most North American salamander species. This project will parameterize Bsal epidemiological models using controlled experiments with adult and juvenile eastern newts that will: (1) include transmission pathways in both the aquatic and terrestrial environments for a range of ambient temperatures, (2) consider two unique forms of infectious Bsal zoospores, (3) identify the role of zoospore persistence in water and soil, and factors that affect it, (4) explicitly model zoospore shedding and between-host transmission as disease progresses, and (5) include a recovery stage as an infection outcome. The project also will quantify innate and adaptive immune responses to Bsal, identify the mechanisms of Bsal pathogenesis, and parameterize integral projection models that explore the impacts of host resistance and infection tolerance on salamander-Bsal dynamics. This award will significantly advance the foundational knowledge of Bsal epidemiology, immunology, and pathology, and will provide the basis for science-derived disease intervention strategies that are generalizable across similar at-risk species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Urbanization causes many wildlife species to decline, but some species capitalize on new resources, especially food, provided by humans in urban and suburban habitats. Shifts in wildlife ecology in response to intentional (e.g., bird feeders) or accidental (e.g., garbage) feeding by humans can alter their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. This can happen when human-provided food causes wildlife to gather at high densities and mix with species they naturally would not contact, increasing their exposure to pathogens. Supplemental feeding could also affect an animal's ability to fight infection by boosting body condition and immune defense; alternatively, human-altered diets might change the makeup of their gut bacteria and increase their, susceptibility to infection. This research project directly examines whether food provided to wildlife changes their interactions with pathogens, from the colonization of individual hosts to disease spread across the landscape, with associated disease risks for humans. The researchers will focus on interactions between the gut pathogen Salmonella and White Ibis in South Florida; these wading birds have recently shifted from feeding in natural wetlands to urban parks, where they subsist on leftover food and handouts from people. The researchers will use experiments, field observations and radio-tracking technology to investigate how urban diet influences Salmonella infection through changes in condition and immune defense of individual birds, and movement and flocking behaviors of White Ibis across different sites and habitat types. Mathematical models will be developed to forecast the spread of infection in relation to human feeding in urban parks.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of urban White Ibises, the researchers will involve citizen scientist volunteers in reporting their observations, and will engage in outreach efforts to educate the public on the health-related effects of feeding wildlife. This interdisciplinary project will also provide numerous opportunities for training undergraduates, graduate students, and research professionals, including individuals from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This research represents the most comprehensive study to date of how wildlife responses to changing food resources in human-dominated habitats influence their interactions with infectious diseases. Activities integrate field studies, captive challenge experiments and mathematical modeling to address three questions: (i) How does provisioning influence pathogen susceptibility, shedding, and impacts on individual hosts? (ii) How does provisioning influence local-scale contacts and transmission dynamics? and (iii) How does provisioning alter host movements, pathogen transmission and impacts at the landscape level?  The first question will be answered by quantifying individual-level diet, immune defense, pathogen shedding and indicators of condition/health in urban and natural habitats.  The researchers will further test whether gastrointestinal microbiota depend on diet and habitat type through work with wild and captive birds. The second question will be addressed through measures of host contact, including flock size and species composition in urban and natural habitats, and by measuring the prevalence and genotypes of Salmonella. The third question will be addressed by using geospatial tracking technology and citizen science reporting to characterize the movements of ibises, and identify ecological correlates of habitat use and infection metrics. Field and experimental work will directly inform a mathematical model that links diet to pathogen spread, to predict changes in infection prevalence and impacts.  This modeling framework can be applied more broadly to understand how other wildlife species and their pathogens might respond to future urbanization and associated shifts in food resources."

Transformations of nitrogen-containing molecules into different chemical forms in soil can regulate whether it is retained in ecosystems to be available for plant and microbial uptake or lost from ecosystems to contribute to water and air pollution. This project will improve understanding of when, where, and why different nitrogen-containing molecules are produced and consumed in forest soils. This project has broad societal implications because of the potential to moderate the effects of human-induced nitrogen inputs on ground- and surface water pollution from soil leaching and gas emission. Knowledge gained from this research can guide future studies to develop best management practices to retain nitrogen in agroecosystems to improve crop yields while reducing nutrient runoff and release from fertilizer use. The project supports an early career female scientist as the principal investigator and contributes to the training of a female graduate student. All project personnel will be involved in the mentoring of undergraduate and high school students in research experiences, including recruiting students who are members of under-represented groups in science and developing a new a short course on Soil Biology for the Illinois 4-H Summer Academy, serving a variety of high school students.<br/><br/>The process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), carried out by soil microbes, plays a pivotal role in regulating ecosystem nitrogen retention versus loss because nitrate is a more mobile nitrogen-containing molecule than ammonium. By converting nitrate to ammonium, DNRA retains nitrogen in ecosystems to support plant productivity, reduces nitrate loss to ground- and surface waters, and competes with the process of denitrification to decrease gaseous dinitrogen and nitrous oxide losses. Despite its importance, DNRA is generally disregarded and understudied in non-flooded ecosystems on land because of the misconception that the process is restricted to conditions typically found in flooded environments. State-of-the-art stable isotope and molecular techniques will be used to unravel the existing paradoxical understanding of DNRA by answering the following the questions: (1) Where can DNRA occur, and why? (2) which microorganisms are responsible for DNRA? and (3) How important is DNRA relative to denitrification as a fate of nitrate, and what controls the competition between these two pathways? The study will utilize sites across the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) and Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) Networks. Sites will be selected to represent a range in edaphic properties, climate, and microbial community structure that can control the environmental and genetic potential for DNRA. Laboratory soil microcosm experiments will be used to determine how oxygen and nitrite affect rates of DNRA and other nitrogen transformation processes that interact with DNRA, such as nitrification and denitrification. Stable isotope tracer and pool dilution techniques will be used to measure gross rates of these processes. Illumina sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and proteomic analyses will be used to interrogate which microbes perform DNRA and why."

Speciation results from genes that cause reproductive incompatibilities between groups of individuals, and earlier studies have suggested these genes are located on the X chromosome. This project will investigate the role of the X chromosome in the evolution of two closely related species of field crickets. These two cricket species are still capable of producing some hybrid offspring and exchanging genetic information. Populations of these species co-occur in the Northeastern U.S., where they form an extensive natural hybrid zone, in which genes have been exchanged for thousands of generations. The researchers will investigate rates of genetic mixing between the species, and determine where it occurs across the genome. This research will address the hypothesis that the X chromosome contains the genes that lead to reproductive isolation, by testing whether the X chromosome shows a lower rate of genetic exchange between species. Specific genes located within regions of low genetic exchange will also be identified to further our understanding of what is required for new species to evolve. This is a collaborative research project that will be mainly conducted at a liberal arts, undergraduate college and will provide substantial opportunity for training and mentoring of undergraduate students. Outreach includes science education workshops and activities, and will target underrepresented, middle and high school students in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The proposed research will test both the importance of the X chromosome in speciation and whether observed islands of differentiation in the field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, reflect differential introgression and/or recent selection. The project has three main objectives. First, the X chromosome will be mapped using hybrid backcrosses and within species crosses; patterns of differentiation for these X-linked chromosome markers will be assessed. Second, gene sequences will be obtained from genome regions that show varying rates of gene exchange and differentiation between species. Genome regions with low rates of gene flow and high differentiation might harbor genes responsible for reproductive isolation and species identities. Absolute and relative measures of genetic differentiation and estimates of selection will be calculated for high differentiation regions and for control regions with low differentiation. These results will be used to test if the genome is composed of a patchwork of high and low differentiation regions. The third objective is based on the observation that there is a one-way incompatibility between the two cricket species, but that this 'rule' is broken in some population crosses. If regions of high differentiation are responsible for reproductive isolation, then there should be consistent genomic differences between pairs that produce offspring and those that do not. Results will provide important insights into the genomic architecture of speciation, the role of the X chromosome in reproductive isolation and divergent adaptation, and will contribute to ongoing debates about genomic islands of differentiation."

The first prediction is that by taking the relationships among different pathogen species and different hosts species that they infect into account, we will improve our ability to predict which plants can be affected by which pathogens in nature. This prediction will be tested with a variety of plants and their pathogens. The second prediction is that when a new plant species (such as a crop) is introduced into an area, pathogens that infect close relatives already growing there will be most likely to 'spill over' and affect the new crop. The last prediction is that because pathogens are less likely to spread between species that are not closely related, mixtures of crop species could be designed to reduce problems due to diseases in agriculture. In the process of testing these predictions, the researchers will develop new analytical tools for the study of plant disease. This work will aid in developing new strategies for protecting crop plants from disease, and for protecting other valuable plant resources. The large training component of this project will include high school classes, college classes, senior thesis students, and PhD students.  These students will learn skills from many fields that have both basic science and economic importance, including forest ecology, ecological monitoring, ecology of agricultural systems, ecological horticulture and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This project will test predictions regarding the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness of hosts and the host ranges of the pathogens that infect them. For each of the three components of the project, the researchers will take advantage of a previously developed and validated quantitative model that predicts how pathogen host ranges are constrained by the evolutionary relationships among host plants. In a novel application of network theory, the researchers will incorporate phylogenetic structure into network models for plant-pathogen interactions. They will use a metagenomics approach (identifying all fungal species growing inside plants by extracting and sequencing their DNA) to characterize the plant-pathogen networks of three plant communities, and will test predictions against the empirical networks. Novel hosts will be used in a transplant experiment in the field and an inoculation experiment in the laboratory to measure which local fungi colonize novel hosts, and how the phylogenetic structure of local plant-fungus networks affects fungal spillover to novel hosts. Finally, collaborating with a certified organic research farm, the PIs will test whether phylogenetically diverse cover crops have reduced disease pressure, a hypothesis called the ""Dilution Effect"", and whether greater phylogenetic distance among intercropped species suppresses disease."

This project integrates new evolutionary theory, field and laboratory experiments, and genomic analyses to test key hypotheses about the role of mating system changes in plant speciation. The project investigates the processes that determine where and when strong barriers to mating occur. It will clarify whether evolutionary changes in rates of self-fertilization directly promote reproductive isolation between diverging species. The experimental work focuses on two subspecies of the California annual plant, Clarkia xantiana, which differ in mating system. One subspecies is primarily self-fertilizing the other is primarily outcrossing. These plants are ideal for study because they exhibit features of newly formed species. However, they have only recently diverged and can still interbreed. Moreover, their flowers are substantially different where they co-occur, a signature of the speciation process. The proposed work will also involve extensive outreach to the public via an innovative program called, 'Market Science', where researchers present topics to and engage directly with the public at local farmers' markets. This highly successful program will be expanded to include new topics on evolutionary biology. The proposed project will also directly involve undergraduates in authentic research in the classroom.<br/><br/>The proposed work address three primary objectives. Aim 1 examines the role of natural selection in the evolution of reproductive character displacement between sister outcrossing and selfing lineages. This work involves the development of novel theoretical models of character displacement that incorporate divergence in mating system. It also involves large-scale field experiments that quantify the role of individual traits in conferring reproductive isolation and determine their genetic basis. Aim 2 examines the ecological and genetic costs of hybrid formation between sister outcrossing and selfing lineages. This work involves field experiments and genomic analyses that quantify the reproductive fitness of hybrids. Aim 3 synthesizes Aims 1 and 2 by asking about how reproductive isolating mechanisms collectively influence genome-wide patterns of variation and introgression between the two taxa.

Pollination of plants by insects or birds is a fundamental mutualism interaction of both natural and agricultural communities. Mutualisms produce critical resources required for the persistence of species involved in the mutualistic interactions. For example, pollinators (insects, bird) are essential for reproduction in many crop plants and pollinators are dependent on food obtained from flowers. In natural communities, mutualisms often involve large groups of species that have similar functional roles. For instance, many flowering plant species live together in a community and are pollinated by a number of different insect species. Similar functional roles among species may contribute to the persistence and success of mutualism communities because alternate partners can provide necessary resources. In addition, species with similar functional role could also provide protection from exploiters or parasites of mutualisms that take resources or services without reciprocating. The study will test the effect of numbers of species, degree of role similarity among species on the stability of multi-mutualist communities. The study also will test how the presence of exploiters affects community persistence. The investigators will use a synthetic mutualism in budding yeast. Understanding how mutualisms persist is critical for protection and restoration of natural communities and in creating successful strategies for sustainable farming.

But species are dynamic entities, and their geographic distributions respond to changing environments. If the environment of their suitable habitat changes, populations of a species can sustain themselves in their current habitat by adaption through natural selection, or they need to shift to new locations. Understanding the mechanisms that account for species distributions is especially timely because of the accelerating pace of environmental change. The contribution of adaptation to population dynamics, local persistence, and to the geographic range inhabited by a species, has rarely been quantified. Although comparative ecological studies and species distribution models typically assume genetic uniformity across a species geographic range, genetic studies have repeatedly demonstrated local adaptation. This project explicitly examines the contribution of adaptation to population growth and the extent of a species geographic range, through the continuation of a long-term field population demographic study and the use of a species distribution model. The project will also involve outreach to a rural middle school, engaging students in research activities, and it will connect citizens to research scientists through an innovative outreach program, Market Science, where researchers engage the public at farmer's markets. <br/><br/>The research team will focus on a well-studied California native plant species, Clarkia xantiana, which has been the focus of intensive field research for over 12 years. This research will provide new, exceptionally detailed information about how species' ranges evolve and the factors that are likely to influence species responses to climate variation. The specific objectives of this project are to examine: (1) whether population dynamics vary from the center to margins of the species' range and what environmental factors drive this variation; (2) the spatial scale of local adaptation and how it relates to demographic similarity among populations; and (3) the interplay of population dynamics and adaptation in shaping environmental tolerances (niche width) and geographic range size. Only long-term studies can provide robust predictions about what controls population persistence, evolutionary adaptation, and their consequences for species ranges. Long-term demographic datasets of vital rates (e.g. survival, reproduction), population growth, and abiotic and biotic (herbivory) factors, have been collected in 35 natural populations spanning the major portion of the species' range.

Current theory largely considers the situation of a single species invading into a stable habitat.  Those models are inadequate to address the realistic situation of invasive species interacting with competitor species as the invasion front moves across the landscape.  They also do not incorporate the fact that habitats themselves can shift on the landscape as a result of climatic and other environmental changes.   For example, rapid movement of habitats toward the poles and higher elevations is a contemporary, global phenomenon.   This research project will develop new theory, backed by experiments with model species in the laboratory, to explain how species invasions are shaped by the presence of competitor species, and the situation of habitats shifting on the landscape.  This work will advance ecological science by providing a stronger theoretical basis for projections of species range shifts driven by invasive species and climate, and provide models useful to land managers, public health officials, and conservation biologists concerned with the spread of invasive species.  This project will provide hands on training and experience to biologists from undergraduate students to postdoctoral scholars, enabling them to become the leaders of the next generation of scientists tackling complex problems in biology.<br/><br/>Important new phenomena for range dynamics emerge when two or more species are considered, and especially given that at the edge of any species range, densities are low, stochasticity must play an important role.

The research will determine 1) how interactions with a resident species modify the range expansion of an invader and its effect on the resident; 2) how species interactions and stochasticity set species ranges in stationary heterogeneous environments; and 3) how species interactions, stochasticity, and moving environments set species ranges and alter spatial community structure."

In tropical forests, these transformations are likely to respond to variations in climate, and in turn, cause feedbacks in the global climate system. In particular, humid tropical forests cycle carbon more rapidly than any other ecosystem on Earth. A consistently warm and wet climate promotes rapid plant growth, as well as rapid decomposition of dead plant material. However, in their wet, clay-rich soils, biological activity frequently consumes oxygen faster than it is replaced by diffusion, temporarily creating regions of low oxygen availability in the surface soils. Periods of low oxygen availability are generally thought to enhance soil carbon storage by slowing the activity of micro-organisms that consume dead plant matter. If oxygen availability fluctuates, this may lead to more complex interactions. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of these linkages, help explain why tropical forests have the highest global rates of soil carbon dioxide emissions, and inform global models and predictions used by public policy makers. In addition, the project will educate and train K-12 students and communicate scientific findings to the public. Project leader Dr. Silver will develop and run annual workshops on communicating climate change science together with local collaborators in Puerto Rico. Both PIs will provide direct student instruction including workshops with elementary students in California and internships for students from Georgia high schools with lower college attendance.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to a better understanding of the controls on carbon cycling in tropical forests by: (1) determining the role of iron-redox cycling in organic matter decomposition; (2) quantifying the importance of two novel biogeochemical processes in tropical forests - abiotic iron oxidation coupled to carbon oxidation, and increased dissolved organic carbon production from iron oxidation. Both of these processes have the potential to contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon fluxes and to alter our understanding of carbon dynamics in tropical ecosystems. Studies will use a combination of laboratory, field experiments and modeling.  Field experiments will be conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, and will take advantage of an automated sensor network installed as part of the NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatory, as well as related research that will form the template from which to conduct experiments on the interactions of iron and carbon biogeochemistry. Radiocarbon measurements will determine the relative age of oxidized carbon, and 13C labeled substrates will be used to explore the potential for iron oxidation to stimulate the decomposition of complex carbon compounds. Structural equations and kinetic models will allow us to scale the work to the ecosystem level. The conceptual and numerical models developed from this research will address missing linkages between microscale redox processes to ecosystem level carbon cycling across a range of forest soil conditions and landscape positions. This work will help determine the potential sensitivity of tropical forest biogeochemistry to changes in climate and associated redox conditions, as well as feedbacks from soil carbon dynamics to atmospheric CO2."

For most animals (insects, fish, plankton) in streams and lakes the carbon starts out as carbon dioxide and then is captured by algae and plants. This carbon then passes on to plankton, insects, and fish. Recent studies suggest there might be other sources of carbon in rivers such as methane that are supporting aquatic plants and algae. However, little is known about the sources of this methane and how it gets incorporated into the life in rivers, streams, and lakes. Methane may be released to groundwater and streams in areas with high geologic or geothermal activity. This EAGER award will conduct the first study to explore the role of geologic and fossil methane as an alternative carbon source in supporting life in river floodplains. The award will also support research training of students and doctoral scholars, engage fish hatchery managers in citizen science research, and provide knowledge of how river systems function to the public.<br/><br/> The underlying assumption for most ecosystems on Earth is that the fixation of modern carbon dioxide drives productivity and biodiversity, with little recognition or study of other potential carbon pathways (e.g., methane) as drivers of productivity and biodiversity. Despite the likely contribution of fossil and geologic methane to freshwater systems and the potential for methane to be transformed ecologically into less harmful forms, the freshwater biotic processes affecting this greenhouse gas source are poorly known. This EAGER award will investigate the role of abiotic, thermogenic, and fossil methanogenic methane subsidies in supporting freshwater floodplain ecosystems by providing a carbon source to the carbon-limited shallow aquifer food web (deep hyporheic zone). The objective of this award is to quantify contributions of carbon from various methane sources to the aquifer food web. Innovative stable isotope methods will be used to assess the carbon sources and trace them through the floodplain foodweb, then develop new approaches for discovering methane source contributions to freshwater ecosystems. This research could potentially shift the current carbon dioxide-based paradigm of driving productivity and biodiversity by demonstrating that shallow aquifer food webs below river floodplains are driven by geologic and fossil methane-derived carbon. Therefore, these floodplain aquifers would be the first to demonstrate a conceptually and ecologically analogous paradigm to oceanic hydrothermal vent ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of the importance of pollinators, insuring their health is essential for preserving biodiversity and promoting global agricultural security. As pollinators, some native bees can show strong loyalty by limiting their visits to only flowers from a certain species, while other bees may not be so loyal, visiting many different types of flowers. In theory, plants with loyal pollinators should produce more fruit and seeds because the pollinators provide only the appropriate pollen type when they visit.  The aim of this research is to understand the degree to which native bees show loyalty to certain plants. This study also explores how the sharing of pollinators between closely related plants might influence how many seeds those plants produce. If some of the plants do worse than others when sharing pollinators, differences in pollinator loyalty may influence how common or rare those plants become. The results of this research are important for understanding the role pollinators play in maintaining healthy and diverse agricultural and natural plant communities. This research contributes to the training of a graduate student, develops a lab and field program for a high school biology class and provides opportunities to engage and encourage women and under-represented students in STEM science.<br/><br/>Coexistence theory addresses how species richness is maintained in biological communities by framing species interactions as a balance of competition within versus between species. This study uses that theory to investigate whether pollinator sharing affects coexistence dynamics in four co-occurring plants in the genus Clarkia. Determining whether pollinator sharing is detrimental or favorable for flowering plant coexistence hinges on understanding the flower preference and constancy of native bees that specialize on flowers and the quantity of pollen they provide. The diversity and quantity of pollen found on Clarkia's pollinators will be measured with a genetic identification technique (qPCR). These measurements will be used in conjunction with estimates of each plant species' competitive ability to determine whether shared pollinators can change plant fitness and whether the pattern shows a negative frequency dependence. This study will shed light on the role that pollinator sharing can play in promoting the coexistence of flowering plants."

This research will investigate a striking case in a group of trees and shrubs (Viburnum) in which rapid differentiation appears to have occurred repeatedly into two radically different plant forms. Major differences in the leaves of these plants appear to have resulted from adaptation to adjacent forest types that differ subtly in environmental variables. The evident replication of this process in several different mountain regions throughout the New World tropics, provides a rare opportunity to critically test a model of rapid ecological speciation. Detailed studies of adjacent plant populations will be carried out in different mountain regions in Mexico with the aim of identifying the environmental factors and the nature of the variation within populations that have favored the rapid evolution of these leaf traits. It should also be possible to identify genes that underlie these key plant characteristics by taking advantage of natural hybridization between these species. These studies will yield general insights into speciation but also into the adaptive significance of the leaf traits that differentiate related species throughout the flowering plants. This research will be carried out in collaboration with Mexican scientists and will involve multiple undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach activities have been designed to foster interactions between participants from the United States and Mexico.  <br/><br/>This project focuses specifically on understanding the drivers of speciation in three species pairs in the mountains of Eastern and Southern Mexico. The two species in each pair differ dramatically in leaf size and shape (large and round versus small and elliptical), in leaf margins (toothed versus smooth), and in leaf pubescence (densely hairy versus lacking hairs). The research will focus on quantifying variation within individual plants, within populations, and between the species pairs, and on determining the abiotic and biotic factors that differ between their forest habitats. Hypotheses on the adaptive value of the leaf variables will be tested using transects between adjacent habitats and a reciprocal transplant experiment.  In areas that have long been disturbed by indigenous agricultural practices, extensive hybridization has resulted in a wide array of intermediate leaf forms.  Molecular analyses of these hybrid swarms should allow the identification of the major genes that underlie differences in leaf form. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded with the Office of International Science and Engineering."

However, this approach, called managed relocation, entails a number of risks, such as moving organisms at the wrong time or to the wrong location or introducing species that may become problematic in their new environments. This project will examine the risks and benefits of moving species to more appropriate locations as opposed to simply protecting their current habitats. A key part of this project will be to explore how the uncertainty of available environmental information might influence the decision making process used by wildlife managers. The outcomes from this study will benefit society by informing conservation planning decisions across a variety of plant and animal species and will advance science education by combining basic research with its direct application. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to quantify how the potential benefits and risks of managed relocation strategies compare to protection and restoration programs under different sources of uncertainty and decision-making processes. A suite of dynamical modeling frameworks will be employed to model managed relocation, which is defined as the purposeful movement of both species (assisted migration) and genotypes (assisted gene flow) beyond their historical range, with the intention of supporting population persistence under different models of changing environmental conditions. Competitive metacommunity models will model assisted migration accounting for the risk of accidentally introducing invasive species that negatively impact recipient communities, and coupled genetic-demographic models will examine the risk of loss of local adaptation and metapopulation-level genetic diversity. All models will quantify how risks and benefits depend on the demographic and environmental indicators used, with associated uncertainty, to decide when, where, and how many individuals to relocate. In turn, this study will also address how local-scale rescue and global-scale homogenization trade-off in determining the effects of connectivity on diversity. Finally, this project will advance the understanding of how conservation associated decision-making should be approached given ongoing global change and different levels of uncertainty."

Acidification events are short periods of time, from a few days to weeks, when the stream water becomes moderately acidic.  These events result from the breakdown of forest organic material releasing carbon dioxide that moves with the water into streams, creating acid conditions in streams. Changes in acidification can affect the way streams function and their biodiversity.  Research in lowland streams in Costa Rica suggest that stream invertebrates and algae, can withstand moderately acid conditions, but are negatively affected when acid conditions are extreme.  This project investigates how periodic acidification affect streams in lowland Costa Rica.  The research will take place at La Selva Biological Station, on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica, where streams have been under study for more than 25 years.  The main objective of this work is to understand the mechanisms and consequences of changing precipitation patterns on the acidity, biology and ecosystem functions of tropical streams.  Acidification is a common phenomenon in streams wordwide, thus it is important to understand it in order to protect and sustain stream ecosystems. The research (1) will contribute to understanding how changing patterns of rainfall affect stream biodiversity and ecosystem function, (2) provide research training for graduate and undergraduate students, and (3) provide environmental outreach through a citizen science project using the iNaturalist mobile device application. <br/><br/>The study will further ongoing long-term research on the consequences of changing patterns of precipitation on lowland tropical streams in Costa Rica.  Ongoing LTREB research described the occurrence of episodic acidification events.  It was hypothesized that an influx of soil-derived CO2 via subsurface flow paths contributes to those pH declines, signaling a tight coupling among rainfall, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems. Precipitation-driven acidification events are stronger and more common in solute-poor, poorly-buffered, streams than in solute-rich, well-buffered, streams - a characteristic of the study landscape.  This project will evaluate and further develop this hypothesis by (1) assessing the relation among daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal patterns in stream water chemistry with major climate events (e.g., El Nio and La Nia - ENSO), by (2) assessing biotic responses to climate-driven acidification, and by (3) experimentally buffering a low-solute stream against acidification related to ENSO events. Climate trends and global circulation models predict changes in the frequency and intensity of weather extremes. For Central America, models predict greater seasonality, similar to patterns observed during ENSO years.  In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, El Nio events result in abnormally low precipitation during the dry season, while La Nia results is high precipitation.  Thus, the project will advance our understanding the consequences of extreme weather events on tropical lowland stream ecosystems."

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

The project will support community education through collaboration with the Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education, Flint Hills Discovery Center, Manhattan Boys and Girls Club, and United School District 383. <br/><br/>The research is organized around four major themes (land-use change, climatic variability, altered biogeochemical cycles, and restoration ecology) and builds on a 30-yr foundation of long-term experiments and measurements in terrestrial and aquatic grassland ecosystems. Watershed- and plot-level experiments at Konza Prairie have altered fire, grazing, climate, nutrient availability in ways that have created a range of different ecological states and legacies. New research will couple ongoing long-term observations and experiments with new studies to (1) test and refine conceptual and theoretical models of community and ecosystem change, and (2) provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying ecological responses to critical environmental and land-use changes. This research will a) measure responses to long-term manipulation of fire, grazing, climate, and nutrients, b) test novel causative factors in additional experiments, c) determine the ability of bison grazing to develop and maintain alternate stable vegetation states, and d) cease or alter some long-term experimental manipulations (water or nutrient availability) to assess ecological legacy effects and feedbacks. Fire and grazing studies will address fundamental questions regarding top-down and bottom-up controls of ecological processes, and effects of heterogeneity on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Studies of woody plant encroachment, climate change, and chronic N enrichment will address three of the most critical changes occurring in grasslands worldwide. Researchers will use intermediate fire return treatments too ask whether observed shrub encroachment under intermediate fire intervals represents a new stable state. Restoration studies will test fundamental ecology theories on controls of plant diversity and community assembly, while building a foundation for more effective strategies for restoring grasslands and conserving grassland biodiversity. This research is conceptually integrated through a common theme of sensitivity and resilience of grasslands to natural and anthropogenically-altered drivers. When these diverse and creative research projects are taken together, this long-term project is poised to address major global change phenomena and to test fundamental ecological theory related to non-linear dynamics and alternate stable states, productivity-diversity and disturbance-stability relationships, top-down vs. bottom-up regulation of ecological processes, food web dynamics, and responses to environmental heterogeneity."

Cities are concentrated consumers of energy and resources and producers of various wastes, but they are also centers of social networks, innovation, efficiency, and solutions. The Central Arizona Phoenix Long-term Ecological Research Program (CAP LTER) includes scientists and students from a variety of disciplines focused on understanding cities as hybrid ecosystems with interacting environmental and human components. The scientific objectives guiding this research are: 1) to answer fundamental questions about ecological structure and function of urban ecosystems that require a long-term perspective and 2) to develop general theory and models to deepen understanding of cities as social-ecological systems.  The CAP science program includes innovative investigations of land use and land cover change, social and ecological surveys and long-term experiments designed to test hypotheses about social and biophysical factors influencing energy flow, nutrient cycling and food webs in the city of Phoenix.  In addition, CAP researchers are committed to partnering with stakeholders to develop pathways to designing resilient and sustainable cities, and educating urban dwellers of all ages and experiences. Ecology Explorers, the premier CAP education program, connects teachers and pre-college students with CAP scientists. CAP is also expanding the involvement of Phoenix residents in scientific research by working with community partners such as the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy, the Central Arizona Conservation Alliance, the Desert Botanical Garden, the Valley Permaculture Alliance, and numerous municipal agencies. Finally, the large, diverse, and rich database produced by CAP research continues to be a valuable and growing resource for a global community of scientists and students, city managers and decision makers, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>Understanding the structure and function of urban ecosystems remains central to the CAP enterprise. The central question is: How do the services provided by dynamic urban ecosystems and their infrastructure affect human outcomes and behavior, and how do human actions affect patterns of urban ecosystem structure and function and, ultimately, urban sustainability and resilience? This question highlights the interconnectedness of human motivations, behaviors, actions, and outcomes with physical and biological structure and function in urban ecosystems. The overarching goal is to foster social-ecological urban research aimed at understanding these complex systems using a holistic, ecology of cities perspective while contributing to an ecology for cities that enhances urban sustainability and resilience. A new theoretical focus is on urban infrastructure as a critical bridge between the system's biophysical and human/social components. Infrastructure is thus central to the conceptual framework that guides all CAP activities. CAP researchers explore new social-ecological frontiers of interdisciplinary urban ecology in residential landscapes, urban waterbodies, desert parks and preserves, the flora, fauna, and climate of a riparianized desert city, and urban design and governance. Research activities are organized around eight interdisciplinary questions and 11 long-term datasets and experiments, and researchers are organized into eight Interdisciplinary Research Themes to ensure multiple perspectives are brought to bear on all questions.  This structure will ensure CAP continues to make fundamental contributions to urban systems theory, knowledge, and predictive capacity while helping Phoenix and other cities cope with an increasingly uncertain future."

This specialization is driven by the need for parasites to efficiently encounter and infect at least some hosts, which often comes at the cost of being able to infect others. At a broad-scale, parasite species adapt to a particular set of host species. At a finer-scale, many parasite strains specialize at overcoming the defenses of a narrow range of host genotypes within a species. There is little understanding of how evolutionary processes of host and parasite adaptation at the fine scale are linked to the evolution of parasite host ranges at broader scales, in part because few host-parasite systems are amenable to research at both scales. In this project the researchers will capitalize on a natural, ancient host-parasite system that allows for molecular investigation of parasite specialization at multiple scales. Escovopsis is a diverse genus of parasitic fungus that attacks other fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants. Different Escovopsis species are able to infect different species of cultivated fungi, and at a finer scale, different Escovopsis genotypes are able to infect and utilize different host genotypes. Such parasite specificity suggests a dynamic pattern of adaptation and provides a rare opportunity to identify traits underlying parasite specialization at multiple scales. As part of this project, classes of undergraduate students will study parasite evolution through investigation of the parasites' host ranges and the parasites' genomes, and middle school students will learn about parasite evolution through an integrated science and art approach. <br/><br/>Building on existing knowledge of Escovopsis diversity and host range, as well as recently gained insights into the Escovopsis genome, the researchers will couple experimental assays of parasite-host interactions, transcriptomics, population genomics and genetic manipulation to explore the genetic underpinnings of pathogen specialization. Specifically, the researchers will utilize transcriptomics and functional assays to identify the gene underlying the parasites' responses to host strains that they can and cannot infect. They will study the evolution of these genes in light of the evolution of the rest of the parasite genome through genomic comparisons across species and across strains within species. Taken together, the researchers will be able to assess whether similar traits underlie parasite specialization at broad and fine evolutionary scales in a tractable, ancient host-parasite system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This concept is foundational to our understanding of how biological communities are organized. Using microbes found in the water-filled leaves of pitcher plants, this project will test this principle and its predictions about how species interactions evolve. A novel experimental approach will be used that compares the evolution of multiple species occurring in communities of increasing species diversity. Much of community ecology assumes that each species has its own ideal ecological role, called the niche, and that evolution can lead species to change their niche to limit resource competition from other species.  Darwin's finches provide a good example, where these bird species evolved to be more different when together on islands, as compared to when they were alone.  However, predictions about the evolution of the niche become more difficult in complex communities where many species may evolve at the same time. In addition to conducting greenhouse experiments involving pitcher plant microbial communities, the PIs will train undergraduate and graduate students as well as develop educational activities that target Florida science standards.    <br/><br/>This work will address long-standing hypotheses that competition leads to niche partitioning and character displacement. The evolutionary patterns of protozoa species will be quantified in 1-, 2, and 4-species communities, using pitcher plants grown in the greenhouse. This design can be used to ask if species evolve differently in communities of increasing complexity. The theory of niche partitioning, which is thought to lead to coexistence, will be supported if species co-evolve to have reduced competitive interactions, while niche convergence would be supported if increased competitive interactions evolve in multispecies systems.  Specific traits such as cell size and other physical characteristics associated with feeding in the protozoa will also be quantified. Next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to quantifying how the protozoa evolving in different combinations affect the underlying bacterial community."

Despite the trend towards urbanization, little is known about the influence of urban environments on the evolution and ecology of many animals. In Europe, a gene has been found to vary between urban and rural birds. This gene encodes a protein that transports an important hormone in and out of cells. This variation is thought to help birds cope differently with stress in urban settings by influencing mood and behavior. However, a major question remains, does this genetic variation consistently correspond to urbanization across species and around the world?  This research will explore how this gene varies in different bird species inside and outside cities in the Pacific coast of the US and western Amazon of Peru.  Examining the genetic differences in a diversity of birds in different locations will give us general insight into how urbanization affects bird evolution. This urban focused research will make biological science more relevant to human residents and will inform the way cities grow by recognizing that we share these landscapes with wildlife. In addition, this international research will promote scientific exchange between Peru and the US.    <br/><br/>This research will focus on genetic markers associated with a serotonin transporter. To understand the background genetic diversity in these markers, the researchers will first characterize the variation at a biogeographic scale. They will do this by taking tissue samples from natural history museum collections representing the full range of six focal species and sequencing the DNA in the relevant marker regions. Then, along with local scientists in Peru, the researchers will catch birds of the same six species in two large cities, two small cities, and two rural/natural areas. The same genetic markers will be sequenced and variation between the study sites and the larger biogeographic patterns will be assessed. Because a multi-species, multi-environment, comparative approach has not been carried out before, any pattern in the results with inform our understanding of genetic diversity in the tropics and its role in resilience against urbanization. If the patterns at a fine spatial scale are consistent with those at a large spatial scale, it will show that, unlike in Europe, urbanization has not had an important effect on the distribution of alleles of this gene in these species. If the serotonin transporter genetic diversity is different at a fine spatial scale rather than a large spatial scale, while neutral genetic markers show the same patterns of diversity at fine and large spatial scales, it will indicate that this gene has perhaps been under selection associated with urbanization. If all genetic markers show differences at fine spatial scales from large spatial scales, further investigation will be needed to tease apart the roles of ecology and species selection in urban areas, making this project a valuable first foray into a case of rapid adaptive evolution in a novel environment.<br/>"

Earth system models often fail to capture the magnitude or global distribution of these nitrogen gas losses. Denitrification occurs under low-oxygen conditions, and measurements are complicated by both analytical challenges and tremendous spatial and temporal variation. This project will apply a suite of measurement approaches to test hypotheses about the way that several environmental factors regulate denitrification, and it will improve the representation of denitrification in an important earth system model. This research has important implications for policies regulating nitrogen as an air and water pollutant, and improvements to the earth system model support international science and policy programs for predicting future environmental change.<br/><br/>This project will advance understanding of the environmental regulation of denitrification in both field studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire and as represented by the Community Land Model (CLM-CN). At Hubbard Brook, the project will test the role of several environmental factors hypothesized to regulate denitrification, including soil oxygen levels, soil depth, rainfall variability, soil warming, and soil acidification. The project will deploy measurement approaches that include soil core-based fluxes of nitrogen gases, continuous soil oxygen sensors, chamber-based gas fluxes, and nitrate stable isotopes. Together these measurements will provide a comprehensive assessment of denitrification and its environmental drivers, and will enable this project to improve representation of plant-microbe competition and carbon-nitrogen-oxygen biogeochemistry in the Community Land Model. The project will also train two graduate students and one postdoctoral associate, and it will offer hands-on biogeochemistry boot camps for diverse groups of graduate students on the advanced techniques used for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and related ecosystem processes."

Part A will document the biodiversity of 6 groups of marine organisms with high, but poorly known, diversity in the Southern Caribbean (sponges, hydroids, sea anemones, sea squirts, ribbon worms, and seaweeds). This work will emphasize the integration of traditional morphological and molecular characters with non-traditional characters such as larval morphology, live coloration, and characters derived from confocal and electron microscopy. Established experts will work closely with experts-in-training, with a focus on species from the Caribbean coast of Panama that are known to be in particular need of taxonomic revision. Part B will provide training workshops for graduate students and junior researchers interested in developing taxonomic expertise in one of 6 focal groups; enabling them to (1) identify species in the field, (2) efficiently collect and preserve material for subsequent taxonomic work, (3) use existing keys or monographs to identify material to species, and (4) develop personal connections with a global network of other students and specialists. Part C will make the basic skills and vocabulary involved in the taxonomy of all 6 groups globally accessible to both expert and non-specialist workers in biodiversity and conservation. This part will develop a standard package of internet-based tools for each group, including a set of how-to videos and illustrated definitions of technical terms, with translations into several languages.

The area of forests is also being greatly reduced in the Amazon basin by deforestation.  Because trees play such an important role in regulating the climate near the ground, losing trees to massive die offs or deforestation also means changes in that microclimate.  With enough tree die off and large enough reductions in the area forested, the effects of tree loss on microclimates may add together and begin to affect  the climate at much larger scales (or macro-climate).  Recent results from computer models that link climate and forest cover have shown that a large increase in the area of forests in North America actually led to locally warmer conditions and also caused three global scale climate effects: it increased the amount of energy exchanged between the northern and southern hemispheres, it shifted the band of tropical rainfall (known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone), and it increased drought in the Amazon basin of South America.  This raises the concern that decreases in the area forested, which could be caused by either die off or deforestation, could also have important effects both globally as well as locally. In particular, this could link the fates of forests in North America and South America through a so-called climate teleconnection. To address this, this project will use a model that predicts how forests respond to climate to evaluate the effects of large scale decreases in forest area from die off and deforestation in North and South America. To do this, measurements related to how decreases in forested area affects the microclimate near the ground will be made at a series of field sites in both regions.  <br/><br/>This project will provide important information about how decreases in forest area in one hemisphere could affect climate conditions not only locally but also in the other hemisphere.  To find and explore the boundaries of the potential range of responses that could occur in the future, the assessment will evaluate extreme conditions where all forests are removed and then the consequences of actual recent decreases in forested area.  The project will also provide key information on which factors in the models are the most important to accurately measure in order to improve predictions.  Because scientists are uncertain about what conditions massive trigger tree die offs, the project will also provide important information about the reasons for tree death and the expected in climate that might result.  Overall, the project will provide science results that can aide in developing policy.  It will also build a strong collaboration between U.S. and Brazilian scientists.

One fascinating example of this is the reduction or loss of pigmentation in many different cave organisms. Despite how common this pattern is in wild populations, why cave organisms lose pigmentation is not well understood. This research will study the role of pigmentation loss in the evolution of Mexican cavefish. To do so, the project will examine the relationship between pigmentation, levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, and behavioral changes that may be beneficial to animals living underground. The broader impacts of this project take advantage of the cavefish system to increase access to science education. Teachers will work with the researchers to develop new units on cavefish biology to take back to their classrooms. Additionally, the researchers will create an undergraduate class that will allow students to get authentic research experiences. Finally, undergraduates and graduate students will be hired to participate in the research. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand the effects of pigmentation-reducing mutations on behavioral traits. Evidence suggests that mutations in the oca2 gene underlie albinism. Additionally, the mutations may impact levels of sleep-regulating neurotransmitters, raising the possibility that albinism is beneficial by reducing sleep time and promoting foraging in the nutrient-poor cave environment. To test this hypothesis, the research team will focus on A. mexicanus. Some advantages of this system include the existence of multiple, independently evolved cave populations and the ability to hybridize cave and surface fish. Specifically, this project has three aims. First, the researchers will measure levels of three specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine) in multiple populations of fish. Those populations include: 1) surface fish, 2) albino (oca2-mutant), 3) non-albino cavefish, and 4) oca2-mutant surface fish. Measuring neurotransmitter levels in the different fish populations will allow the researchers to determine if enhanced neurotransmitter levels are a general property of cavefish with reduced pigmentation. For the second aim, sleep will be measured in wild-type and oca2-mutant surface fish to determine the role of oca2 in a potentially fitness-related trait. Finally, the researchers will generate hybrids by crossing individuals from cave populations and surface populations. Sleep, pigmentation and neurotransmitter levels will be measured in these hybrid fish to determine the genetic relationship between these traits. Thus, this project will provide new insight into the role of albinism in a cave environment. Further, it will shed light on fundamental principles underlying evolution in response to colonization of a novel environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the profound importance of recombination in evolutionary and genetic studies, there is a significant gap in our basic knowledge of within-species natural variation in recombination. The PIs propose to take advantage of the unparalleled genetic and genomic tools available in the model system Drosophila melanogaster to conduct the first comprehensive study of intraspecific variation in recombination, from the description of where and how much recombination rates vary across genomes and among individuals of the same species, to the elucidation of the molecular causes and evolutionary consequences of this variation. <br/><br/>This study will provide a new paradigm within models of adaptation under suboptimal conditions by investigating a direct mechanistic link between increased recombination and stressful conditions, the very same circumstances where recombination may be most favorable. The PIs also propose a two-pronged approach to increase the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in science and education. They will organize a series of high school seminars, focusing on Evolution as a modern scientific discipline, and create a summer hands-on workshop for future educators. The workshop will focus on evolutionary and genomic concepts, with laboratory experience and experimental activities easily transferrable to secondary education settings. These seminars will enable the participants to confidently discuss contemporary issues related with evolution and modern genomic techniques (e.g., human and primate evolution, personalized medicine, etc.) in their classrooms."

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In making predictions about epidemics, people consider how and when susceptible and infected hosts come into contact with one another, but they generally do not consider what happens after the parasite gets inside its host. However, the within-host battles between host and parasite could also be important for disease spread. These within-host battles happen because a host's body is constantly resisting and defending against parasites. It is important to consider these dynamics in predicting disease dynamics because not all hosts are equally equipped to fend off parasites and diseases.  Ultimately, hosts that have lower immunity are more likely to allow parasites to spread. In this project, the researcher will focus on populations of an invertebrate that lives in lakes in which they experience large parasite epidemics every year. The researcher will improve our understanding of disease spread by incorporating information about how variability in immunity affects it with host-to-host contact information. The results of this project will help scientists better understand the importance of immune defenses when parasites infect humans, farm animals, and wildlife populations. It will also enable the training of a graduate student, and support projects aimed at encouraging underrepresented minority, female and low-income undergraduate and grade school students to be involved in science.<br/><br/>Our understanding of how ecological and immunological factors interact in natural populations to determine both an individual's probability of infection and the subsequent overall disease prevalence remains limited. Working with a model host-parasite system (Daphnia host and fungal parasite), this research examines the mechanisms underlying immune function, as well as the consequences of variable immunity for parasite transmission. Specifically, the researcher will examine how environmental stressors (e.g. resource quality and availability) shape natural Daphnia populations' mean levels of and variation in immune function. The establishment and spread of the highly virulent parasite within these populations will then be quantified, while tracking each population's levels of exposure and infection success through time. The research relies on tools from multiple disciplines, including ecology, quantitative biology, transcriptomics, and immunology. Moreover, the project integrates theories from disease ecology and ecological immunology to examine disease processes across scales: from the genome, to the individual, to the population and community."

What is an individual organism varies greatly. With bacteria, an individual consists of a single cell, while in mammals individuals might have trillions of cells, all coordinating different roles (blood, skin, and so forth) Some species, such as the honey bee, form highly coordinated colonies (with queens, foragers, guards, and so forth) that behave like an individual organism. The evolution of previously distinct entities (cells or insects) into new types of unified individuals (bodies or colonies) are challenging to study because  evolution occurs over long time scales. Instead, the researchers will use computer simulations in which they will manipulate environmental conditions to see how they promote or constrain the evolution of complex individuals. The researchers will also develop web-based software to let others easily explore these evolutionary transitions, with a goal of simplifying experimentation by fellow researchers, facilitating student learning, and promoting citizen science.<br/> <br/>This project will be divided into three conceptual stages: (1) Formation: Under what selective conditions do formerly solitary organisms unite to form a higher-level individual unit? (2) Differentiation: Once higher-level units have been formed, how do the preexisting traits of the lower-level individuals (such as phenotypic plasticity or environmental interactions) influence the evolution of division-of-labor strategies? (3) Complexification: How do different types of division-of-labor mechanisms facilitate the evolution of new, more complex features (such as developmental patterns or tightly-coordinated task performance)? The researchers will use an experimental-evolution approach with digital study organisms that operate in a 2D virtual world. Digital evolution systems allow the researchers to observe all genomes in a population, track all interactions, and record perfect phylogenies. Each digital cell has a fully-functional genetic program, theoretically capable of performing any algorithmic processes. Evolution in these systems frequently produce unexpected survival strategies with complex environmental and inter-cellular interactions, far beyond a traditional simulation. Probing the conditions that produce major transitions in an open-ended and transparent system will contribute to a deeper understanding of our natural origins, generate numerous hypotheses that can be tested concisely in laboratory experiments, and promote ideas for how computational algorithms can be produced that coordinate at a scale comparable to biological systems."

Through generations of breeding to increase yield, crop plants have been selected for a variety of branching patterns that change the number, length or angle of branches. In maize, leaf angle has been an important branching trait that has likely contributed to increasing corn yields. The angle of the leaf is determined by the ligule region, which forms at the boundary between the blade and sheath. The blade tilts back to absorb energy from the sun while the sheath holds tight to the stem. This angle between the blade and sheath is a heritable trait that can be modified through selection: decreased angle makes plants more upright for more compact fields, whereas increased angle optimizes the surface area of the blade for more energy capture. Thus, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms involved in establishing the leaf angle will provide new tools for manipulating maize architecture. This project aims to clarify the complex network of factors that determine when and how the ligule region forms. This project will first identify and characterize the expression of genes that define the ligule boundary during the earliest stages of development. Molecular, genetic and genomic methods will then be used to investigate how the ligule region forms. The results will be shared with diverse audiences including breeders, the scientific community and with students. To that end, YouTube videos will be produced that describe the science of corn development to a general audience and additional educational materials will be generated for student classrooms. All resources will be made publically available through lab websites and the maize community website (http://www.maizegdb.org).  <br/><br/>This project investigates how the ligular region is established as a defined organ boundary in the undifferentiated leaf primordium. Previous work used the anatomically distinct ligule as a site for transcriptome analysis: preligule, preblade and presheath cells were clearly identified for laser capture followed by RNA sequencing. Due to the specificity of capture, a collection of candidate genes was identified that is uniquely and differentially expressed in the ligule region. Shared expression patterns in other organ boundaries suggest that the ligule reiterates the lateral organ initiation program that occurs at the shoot apical meristem and at tassel branch boundaries. Thus, distinctly different organ boundaries are hypothesized to share genes and use common mechanisms to define and restrict developmental pathways. To test this hypothesis, gene networks will be established for early stages of ligule development and mechanisms of ligule initiation further investigated. The first specific aim is to identify the earliest determinants of ligule formation by capturing cells from the youngest accessible leaf primordia. Candidate genes will be prioritized based on their expression in other ligule-specific mutants. The second aim investigates three promising candidate gene pathways that support the role of KNOTTED1 (KN1)-like homeobox transcription factors and partner proteins in establishing the ligule boundary. Mutants will be analyzed in these genes for ligule and branching phenotypes.  The third aim tests the hypothesis that the bZIP transcription factor LIGULELESS2 (LG2), bound by KN1, is involved in positioning the blade/sheath boundary. Protein partners will be identified as will down-stream targets to determine the role of LG2 in establishing the blade sheath boundary."

And, how did it happen that many of these insects depend on beneficial microbes (fungi and bacteria) that are found nowhere else except with those insects?

The project combines a systems approach to biological complexity with manipulations that allow the researchers to integrate three focal dimensions of biodiversity: (1) functional diversity, encompassing how variation in phytochemistry, larval performance, and butterfly egg-laying preference are shaped by microbial, fungal, plant and caterpillar interactions; (2) genetic diversity, including the role of genomic variation within and among populations of interacting plants and insects, both in the wild and in an experiment context; and (3) phylogenetic diversity, focusing on gut bacteria in insects, as well as fungal and bacterial endophytes in plants."

Including the participation of Forest Service decision-makers, who manage 80% of the Klamath region, will ensure the transparency and credibility of the science, thereby increasing its impact on environmental outcomes.<br/><br/>This project will test the general hypothesis that climate may drive a critical transition in the Klamath from a high-biomass conifer forest dominated region to a self- low-biomass shrub-chaparral-hardwood dominated region because of increased fire activity and decreased forest recovery rate. The project will quantify the potential for, and mechanisms underlying, a climate induced transition using a three-pronged research approach: (1) development of general mathematical models to gain a broad understanding of dynamics underlying critical thresholds in fire-prone ecotones and to identify the functional relationships that control transitions between shrub-chaparral-hardwood and mature conifer forest, at local and landscape levels; (2) field research to characterize the climate- dependence of post-fire recovery and to test and parameterize models; (3) process-based simulations of local, landscape, and regional dynamics to characterize the interactive roles of climate, fire, and management in shaping the region's ecological communities. Improving understanding of critical transitions has been recognized as a fundamental challenge in ecology with global relevance and urgency in the face of climate change. Increased understanding of the potential for a critical transition in the Klamath region will inform the management of fire-prone forests worldwide."

Plants that live where fire occurs frequently are often capable of surviving fires. Some of these plants produce fuels that change the likelihood and characteristics of future fires, producing conditions favorable to them and/or their offspring. Soil organisms also affect plant fuels, and some are capable of surviving fires. They represent an important but unrecognized driver capable of altering fuels and future fires, especially in habitats with frequent fires. Soil fungi are a key example of such soil organisms, directly affecting fuel loads by decomposing dead plant tissues and indirectly affecting fuel production through their effects on plant growth. Because fungi differ in fire susceptibility, repeated fires may shape the fungi present, altering direct and indirect effects on fuels (and thus future fires). Knowledge of these fungal effects is important for managing natural fire-frequented habitats such as savannas and grasslands and forecasting the characteristics (such as the likelihood and intensity) of future fires in most terrestrial habitats. This research examines how changes in fires (severity, frequency, suppression) influence fungi and their effects on new fuels, both directly through fuel breakdown and indirectly through plants, then models how these differences may affect future fires. This research will also develop two educational modules on fire, fungi and plants: 1) undergraduate students will test different fire traits of cultured fungi and 2) K-5 classrooms will use inquiry-based learning kits that are developed on fire, fungi and plants, and that directly address next generation science standards. <br/> <br/>The research will be conducted in pine savannas, highly diverse and threatened southeastern habitats dependent on frequent fire. Initial research showed that fire alters soil fungi and results in 40% slower decomposition by microbes of dead plant leaves newly deposited on the ground. Slower decomposition causes fuels to accumulate more quickly in the environment, increasing chances and intensities of future fires. This research uses large-scale field experiments with fire, next generation DNA sequencing, and computer modeling to determine how soil microbes like fungi respond to fire, and if they play an unrecognized role by influencing likelihoods and characteristics of future fires. Because these effects are tested over a spectrum of fire severities, the model based on experimental results can be used in other pyrogenic habitats and can be used to forecast likelihoods and effects of future fires."

Since an early divergence from other land plants some 450 million years ago, mosses took a different path than vascular plants to solving the challenges to survival and reproduction posed by terrestrial environments. One important trait that is well developed in mosses is the capability of drying without dying, known as desiccation tolerance (DT). This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress. Specific methods to be employed include: (1) sequencing the full genomes of S. caninervis and S. ruralis; (2) using next generation sequencing (NGS) to develop genotypic markers for population-level genetic variation studies, signature transcriptome tools for phenotypic analyses (related to ecophysiological and ecosystem investigations), and multiple single-copy genes for phylogenetic analysis; (3) transcriptomics experiments comparing different development stages and sexes of both species in response to desiccation stress and reproductive state; (3) ecophysiological experiments on multiple populations of S. caninervis and S. ruralis, and all 15 species of N. American Syntrichia, to assess phenotypic plasticity in the key trait of DT; (5) population genetic studies of S. caninervis and S. ruralis in different environments; (6) building a robust phylogeny for Syntrichia and using it to understand evolutionary trends and correlations among the traits under study, as well as to produce a refined classification; (7) examining the role of genetic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in the resilience to climate change of biocrust communities that are dominated by Syntrichia (with co-occurring mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria) in field and greenhouse experiments."

How genes diversify and evolve new functions is a little understood but important area in evolutionary biology. The sense of smell in mammals is the result of extreme diversification of genes that code for proteins that detect chemicals in the environment. Some mammals possess over 1,000 such proteins and others only a few hundred. Quantifying the role of natural selection in this diversification is difficult because current models fail to fully account for the processes involved: gene duplication and loss, mutation, as well as the number of gene copies present. This project will develop mathematical tools that incorporate this complexity and test hypotheses about sensory evolution in bat species with divergent specialized diets. The methods developed in the project will be applicable to many types of genes, including those involved in immune function and pathogen recognition. Through training from the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, the research team will design a short video for the public explaining the value understanding the evolution of smell. They will also implement a summer program for underrepresented Long Island, NJ high school students to learn about bat sensory systems.<br/><br/>Previous research has identified several species of plant-visiting bats that have evolved novel olfactory receptors via gene duplication. The match between dietary specialization and olfactory receptors provides an ideal system to test whether newly evolved receptors are related to a reliance on plant resources. A shift from an insectivorous ancestral bat population to a population that exploits fruit and pollen requires not only new morphological adaptations for consumption of these foods, but also fine-tuning of chemosensory systems to find these plant resources. The challenge of understanding the molecular evolution of the mammalian olfactory gene family has prevented a quantitative investigation of this pattern; this project will develop new methods to identify such adaptation. The focal hypothesis is that increased gene copy retention and diversification is connected to the rapid diversification of Neotropical plant-visiting bats. To test this hypothesis, this research involves three major objectives: (1) determine whether olfactory receptor retention rate is correlated with the increased speciation rate observed in plant-visiting bats, (2) empirically test whether olfactory gene duplicates are adaptive at the species level, and (3) evaluate the functional similarity and novelty of the receptors that have recently duplicated in plant-visiting bats. The project will make use of newly developed gene-tree/species tree reconciliation and gene retention models developed for recently diverged populations, as well as codon substitution models and protein reconstructions to detect how selection may be affecting the function of these hyperdiverse genes."

Speciation results from genes that cause reproductive incompatibilities between groups of individuals, and earlier studies have suggested these genes are located on the X chromosome. This project will investigate the role of the X chromosome in the evolution of two closely related species of field crickets. These two cricket species are still capable of producing some hybrid offspring and exchanging genetic information. Populations of these species co-occur in the Northeastern U.S., where they form an extensive natural hybrid zone, in which genes have been exchanged for thousands of generations. The researchers will investigate rates of genetic mixing between the species, and determine where it occurs across the genome. This research will address the hypothesis that the X chromosome contains the genes that lead to reproductive isolation, by testing whether the X chromosome shows a lower rate of genetic exchange between species. Specific genes located within regions of low genetic exchange will also be identified to further our understanding of what is required for new species to evolve. This is a collaborative research project that will be mainly conducted at a liberal arts, undergraduate college and will provide substantial opportunity for training and mentoring of undergraduate students. Outreach includes science education workshops and activities, and will target underrepresented, middle and high school students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The proposed research will test both the importance of the X chromosome in speciation and whether observed islands of differentiation in the field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, reflect differential introgression and/or recent selection. The project has three main objectives. First, the X chromosome will be mapped using hybrid backcrosses and within species crosses; patterns of differentiation for these X-linked chromosome markers will be assessed. Second, gene sequences will be obtained from genome regions that show varying rates of gene exchange and differentiation between species. Genome regions with low rates of gene flow and high differentiation might harbor genes responsible for reproductive isolation and species identities. Absolute and relative measures of genetic differentiation and estimates of selection will be calculated for high differentiation regions and for control regions with low differentiation. These results will be used to test if the genome is composed of a patchwork of high and low differentiation regions. The third objective is based on the observation that there is a one-way incompatibility between the two cricket species, but that this 'rule' is broken in some population crosses. If regions of high differentiation are responsible for reproductive isolation, then there should be consistent genomic differences between pairs that produce offspring and those that do not.  Results will provide important insights into the genomic architecture of speciation, the role of the X chromosome in reproductive isolation and divergent adaptation, and will contribute to ongoing debates about genomic islands of differentiation."

To test this hypothesis, they will conduct a multi-year reciprocal-transplant experiment using two populations from Spain and Croatia that are highly divergent for sexually dimorphic traits. They will also conduct manipulative experiments in the greenhouse and the field to determine: (1) which traits are involved in local adaptation (via phenotypic-selection analyses), and how variation in water availability and air temperature influences this adaptation (via water and temperature manipulation), (2) whether males are under greater selection to diverge, and (3) whether sexual antagonism exists for any of these traits. In addition to pure-population individuals, F2 progeny planted in both Spain and Croatia will allow further determination of which traits and quantitative trait loci (QTL) are targets of differential selection between the two habitats. They will measure the extent to which QTL for divergent traits are essentially sex specific in their effect or shared between the sexes, and lastly, whether QTL responsible for adaptive trait divergence occur in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes.

This project will increase mechanistic understanding of the biodiversity-productivity relationship to better explain how environmental conditions influence ecosystem services. Ecological theory predicts that differences among plant species underlie variation in the biodiversity-productivity relationship. However, the mechanisms underlying this variation among plant species are rarely experimentally quantified, leaving causal connections between plant variation and the biodiversity-productivity relationship elusive. Plants in the legume (bean) family are infected by beneficial soil bacteria called rhizobia, which fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) in exchange for carbon (C) from their plant hosts. As most plants obtain N from soil, access to atmospheric N via this mutualism can differentiate legumes from non-legumes, thus influencing the productivity-diversity relationship. This project will experimentally examine biotic processes that differentiate legume species from each other and from non-legumes to understand how these differences cause variation in patterns of primary productivity within a long-term biodiversity, CO2, and N manipulation experiment in Minnesota, USA--BioCON. To promote public understanding of science, middle school students will grow and observe legume seeds inoculated with local bacteria under two N treatments to test if bacteria from regions with high soil N are less beneficial than those from regions with low soil N. Undergraduates will be trained in relevant techniques and develop independent projects within the scope of this work. The research and outreach projects will inform management of ecosystem function under current and future global change scenarios, with important implications for human well-being.<br/><br/>Niche differences (ND) and relative fitness differences (RFD) among legume species will be assessed by determining the composition and density of, and plant benefit from, the species-specific nodulating rhizobial community (NRC) in soil samples from the ambient condition BioCON biodiversity plots.

Evolution of the NRC in response to enhanced CO2 and/or N, and its consequences for the richness-productivity relationship, will be assessed by determining the composition and density of, and plant benefit derived from, the NRC of each BioCON diversity, CO2, and N treatment combination.

In tropical forests, these transformations are likely to respond to variations in climate, and in turn, cause feedbacks in the global climate system. In particular, humid tropical forests cycle carbon more rapidly than any other ecosystem on Earth. A consistently warm and wet climate promotes rapid plant growth, as well as rapid decomposition of dead plant material. However, in their wet, clay-rich soils, biological activity frequently consumes oxygen faster than it is replaced by diffusion, temporarily creating regions of low oxygen availability in the surface soils. Periods of low oxygen availability are generally thought to enhance soil carbon storage by slowing the activity of micro-organisms that consume dead plant matter. If oxygen availability fluctuates, this may lead to more complex interactions. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of these linkages, help explain why tropical forests have the highest global rates of soil carbon dioxide emissions, and inform global models and predictions used by public policy makers. In addition, the project will educate and train K-12 students and communicate scientific findings to the public. Project leader Dr. Silver will develop and run annual workshops on communicating climate change science together with local collaborators in Puerto Rico. Both PIs will provide direct student instruction including workshops with elementary students in California and internships for students from Georgia high schools with lower college attendance.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to a better understanding of the controls on carbon cycling in tropical forests by: (1) determining the role of iron-redox cycling in organic matter decomposition; (2) quantifying the importance of two novel biogeochemical processes in tropical forests - abiotic iron oxidation coupled to carbon oxidation, and increased dissolved organic carbon production from iron oxidation. Both of these processes have the potential to contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon fluxes and to alter our understanding of carbon dynamics in tropical ecosystems. Studies will use a combination of laboratory, field experiments and modeling.  Field experiments will be conducted in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, and will take advantage of an automated sensor network installed as part of the NSF-funded Critical Zone Observatory, as well as related research that will form the template from which to conduct experiments on the interactions of iron and carbon biogeochemistry. Radiocarbon measurements will determine the relative age of oxidized carbon, and 13C labeled substrates will be used to explore the potential for iron oxidation to stimulate the decomposition of complex carbon compounds. Structural equations and kinetic models will allow us to scale the work to the ecosystem level. The conceptual and numerical models developed from this research will address missing linkages between microscale redox processes to ecosystem level carbon cycling across a range of forest soil conditions and landscape positions. This work will help determine the potential sensitivity of tropical forest biogeochemistry to changes in climate and associated redox conditions, as well as feedbacks from soil carbon dynamics to atmospheric CO2."

But peatlands also release methane back to the atmosphere. The degree to which peatlands act as carbon sinks and methane sources largely depends on the types of plants growing there. The far northern areas where Arctic peatlands occur are warming rapidly and so it is important to determine how sensitive their carbon storages are to changes in vegetation that are already underway. It is known that when the main peatland plants change from sphagnum mosses to sedges, as is happening in many areas, the rate of carbon storage may change a lot, but the specific response of any particular peatland is not easy to predict. Much of the unpredictability results from difficulties in telling apart the dominant plants in peatlands through history. If that was possible, then much better predictions into the future could be made. So the main objective of this project is to create a database of the chemical properties of Arctic sedges and other plants known to dominate peatlands in the past. The database will be available to the public and be set up so that it can be easily updated and added to. The project will also continue a program that brings high school teachers from the New York area to the arctic to participate in field studies associated with the project. These teachers will then develop teaching modules connected to high school science curriculums. <br/><br/>Members of the Cyperaceae (sedges) inhabit diverse environments, spanning a wide range of moisture balance, pH, and nutrient availability. However, they are notoriously difficult to identify by their fossil remains in peat cores, even to the family level, because of the paucity of identifiable plant parts that are species specific. But while the plant parts themselves are often absent, chemicals they produced are almost always present. Of the thousands of compounds produced, most have yet to be properly characterized and linked to particular species. This project will generate such a database and will also relate vegetation types, as characterized by their chemical constituents, to net carbon accumulation rate. In doing so, the first predictive models of carbon accumulation in peatlands based on vegetation change will be developed. This is an important step towards fully integrating peatlands into global climate models, which will allow a more comprehensive understanding of the feedbacks between climate change and peatland carbon accumulation."

Furthermore, through partnerships with the university Kids in Nature program, the researchers will also engage grade school children, and train elementary school teachers in ecology and invasive species. <br/><br/>Ecological complexity makes it difficult to identify general patterns in nature, such as community stability. To understand what drives stability, one could measure changes in systems over time across environmental gradients. Another approach has been to consider how system structure affects community stability. However, it is unlikely that structure and environmental gradients are independent, because environmental factors might alter system structure as well as their stability. To understand how ecosystem size and productivity influences ecosystem stability, 23 high-resolution food-webs from a series of Pacific islets that vary independently in size and productivity will be assembled and compared. A suite of mathematical modeling approaches will then create predictions for how variation in food-web structure affects food-web stability. These model-generated predictions of stability will then be tested against observed changes in food-web structure before and after the removal of a common omnivore, the rat (Rattus rattus). These results can then be used to evaluate the relative importance of ecosystem size, productivity, and food-web structure, in predicting system stability. Cumulatively, these efforts will help identify not only how environmental characteristics structure communities but also the extent to which they drive system-level responses to perturbation."

One aspect of biodiversity that directly impacts human health is its importance in mitigating risk of disease transmission from wildlife.  A prominent theory in ecology is that greater diversity of species reduces the risk of disease transmission, through an effect called dilution. Evidence for the dilution effect has been found in several disease systems, including Lyme disease.  Greater species diversity of small mammals that serve as hosts for Lyme disease result in less transmission of the disease.  However, even in this well-studied system, there is little research on the importance of genetic variation within the Lyme disease pathogen. This project focuses on the Lyme disease system, to address a critical question in disease ecology: how does species diversity of hosts influence pathogen genetic diversity and what does the culmination of these interactions mean for disease risk? This project also will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students, will develop active learning focused courses on disease ecology, and will engage the public in tick-borne disease biology through citizen science opportunities. This research has clear public health implications as Lyme disease is the most reported tick transmitted disease in the United States<br/><br/>This study will incorporate empirical field studies and mathematical modeling to characterize and predict the relationship between host diversity and pathogen genetic diversity in the Lyme disease system in the western United States. Pathogen genotypic diversity will be characterized using novel microfluidics technology and next generation genetic approaches.

Within this global context are some regional cooling trends that also result from human activity, including those that are beneficial to economic and conservation objectives. One of these cooling trends has been found in the summer in the northern North American Great Plains. Maximum air temperatures have decreased by over three degrees and rainfall has increased by an inch during summer across parts of the Canadian Prairie Provinces since the 1970s. These changes are thought to be due to a decrease in the practice of keeping farm fields fallow during summer; Canada alone has lost around 35 million acres of fallow from the 1970s to the present. The United States has seen a similar decline in fallow area, largely in the Northern Great Plains, but the effects of these changes on regional climate in the U.S. have not been studied to date. Fallow was, and still is, widely practiced to save water for subsequent crops in dry regions, but also increases soil erosion and degradation and is not considered sustainable. Producers have also realized that the water-savings benefit of fallow is often outweighed by the economic losses of not planting a crop. The goal of this project is to understand how agricultural management practices that improve soil conservation and may increase on-farm income can also be beneficial to climate, both now and over the coming decades. As part of the project, a field course will be designed to link Tribal Colleges in the Montana University System with the goal of enhancing STEM education among underrepresented students. Project activities will also enhance existing efforts to improve after-school educational programs at the grade-school level. An inter-university consortium will be designed to coordinate research activities in the atmospheric sciences across Montana, including Tribal Colleges. <br/><br/>To understand the role of land management on regional climate, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which it influences the climate system, and to integrate this understanding into models that can predict future climate dynamics. In a region with substantial fallow, warm and dry air from near the land surface rises and creates a high and dry atmospheric boundary layer that is unlikely to experience convective precipitation. If plants are present, more moisture and less heat enters the atmosphere, resulting in a moister atmospheric boundary layer that is not nearly as high, which makes cloud formation convective precipitation processes more likely. In this project, the exchange of heat and water between the surface and atmosphere in fallow, grasslands, and crops will be measured, and atmospheric boundary layer development, convective precipitation, and regional climate modeled. Models will be run over the past three decades to understand how management trends have influenced climate and over the forthcoming three decades to understand how future land management changes may, or may not, continue to counter global warming trends."

While sexual selection is well studied in animals, its existence and evolution in plants is not well known. Understanding this process in plants can contribute to methods for crossing crops with their wild relatives, thereby allowing the transfer of useful wild traits into agricultural species. This research examines variation in chemical signals between male and female gametes (pollen and ovules) in several species in the genus Solanum, a group that includes important crop species: tomato, potato and eggplant. Chemical attraction between gametes is essential for reproduction in most plants and animals. The project will measure the effectiveness of gamete signals within and between species, identify the genetic and chemical causes of variation in signal attractiveness, and the consequences of this variation for patterns of fertilization success. These findings will generate new information about which signaling interactions are essential for fertilization, and greater understanding of why and how differences in male-female signaling interactions evolve. In addition, the project will involve graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students, including women and individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences. <br/><br/>The project addresses the mechanistic basis of divergence in gamete chemoattraction, including the specific causal molecular changes, the role of this divergence in reproductive barriers (gamete isolation) between species, and the ecological and reproductive conditions that influence rates of change in the attraction signal. Preliminary research in the wild tomato group (Solanum) shows that gamete recognition occurs via an ovule-secreted chemoattractant that causes growing pollen tubes to reorient towards conspecific female gametes. Specific combinations of heterospecific gametes show significantly reduced attraction, indicating divergence between some species in this ovule-secreted (female) signal. The proposed work will: quantify the association between divergence in ovule gene expression and gamete chemoattraction within and between a group of closely related species; identify the underlying molecular loci, characterize their patterns of molecular evolution across the clade, and associate sequence changes with functional behavioral divergence in gamete attraction; and, evaluate evidence that selection in general, and sexual selection specifically, is a driver of gamete signal evolution and therefore divergence in chemoattraction between species. The research uses a combination of semi in vivo behavioral assays that manipulate the identity of interacting gametic partners, targeted transgenic markers, functional manipulation, and molecular evolutionary analysis, each of which has already been developed or applied in this experimental system. The findings will provide a comprehensive empirical assessment of the relationship between molecular and functional divergence in gamete recognition molecules, across multiple closely related species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Darwin first proposed that a major cause of biodiversity is competition. The crux of his idea is that when organisms compete for scarce resources, natural selection should favor those individuals that are least like their competitors. Consequently, selection should cause these individuals to become more dissimilar over time, possibly becoming different species. However, species can compete for more than just resources: they can also compete by interfering with each other's ability to identify mates. Yet, few studies have evaluated how these two sources of competition interact with each other. The proposed work evaluates this possibility using a novel model system - spadefoot toads. The work is a significant step forward because the proposed experiments will provide insights into the origins of trait variation and its effects on adaptive evolution. The research is focused on character displacement which is a central evolutionary and ecological concept important to understanding the origins, abundance, and distribution of biodiversity. The work engages students in public outreach in North Carolina and beyond through work at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.<br/><br/>Character displacement takes two forms: ecological character displacement in which traits evolve in response to selection to minimize resource competition between species; reproductive character displacement in which traits evolve in response to selection to minimize deleterious reproductive interactions (e.g., hybridization) between species. Most previous studies of character displacement have focused on either ecological or reproductive character displacement, but not both. Yet, because species that are similar enough to compete for resources are also often similar enough to interact reproductively, the two processes might often interact. An untested hypothesis for how the two forms of character displacement interact is that one process alters trait variation in the alternative context in a way that either facilitates, or constrains, a population's response to selection in that alternative context. This project will use both field and laboratory experiments to test this hypothesis by experimentally mimicking ""first contact"" between two species of spadefoot toads that have undergone both ecological and reproductive character displacement with each other. Specifically, the scientists will evaluate whether divergence in traits associated with one process generates novel trait variation on which the alternative process could act. In doing so, the research promises to have far reaching implications. In particular, because character displacement is central in the origins, abundance, and distribution of biodiversity, understanding its origins can shed light onto some of the most fundamental issues in evolutionary biology and ecology, including the causes of diversity, species coexistence, community assembly, and species distributions."

Although physical differences between males and females are very conspicuous, we have a poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms that generate these differences, and many of their benefits. In Ceratodon, female mosses produce scents to attract small insects that carry sperm from male plants, promoting reproduction, while male plants make few such scents.

Further, extensive background research on devils, including thousands of samples before and after die-offs, affords the rare opportunity to study genomic interactions of an infectious agent and its host across an entire species? range. These genomic studies will shed light on the genetic basis of relative susceptibility of devils to the tumor, thereby allowing managers to choose the best individuals for captive breeding programs. In addition, knowledge of rates and direction of past tumor spread enables the unique ability to predict the precise location of future infections. In turn, devil contact network modeling and genomic studies of populations expected to become infected will facilitate the testing of predictions regarding the course of epidemics in new populations. This knowledge may help in developing responses to future human epidemics."

While much is known about the properties of invasive plants and animals, much less is known about the beneficial microbes (microscopic organisms) that accompany introduced species. Rhizobia are beneficial bacteria that inhabit leguminous plant root tissue where they convert nitrogen from the atmosphere to a plant-available form. Leguminous plants provide these microbes with sugars from photosynthesis. Legumes that disperse to habitats that lack these bacteria are typically unable to persist, however the bacteria can also spread through the soil or air. The aim of this research is to examine whether invasions change the nature of a mutualistic interaction.  The investigators will study specialization and the evolution of cooperation in both natural and experimentally staged invasions for two plant species and their beneficial microbes. While this question has been addressed in aboveground systems, this is one of the first to utilize a belowground plant mutualism. This project will promote diversity in the sciences, provide research training and education in the biology of plant-microbe interactions, and inform efforts to control invasive plants. Diverse undergraduate students from Florida International University will participate in summer research at University of California at Riverside and Michigan State University. An educational module will also be developed on rhizobium-legume interactions in neighborhood soils, to be distributed to school children via MSU's Kellogg Biological Station Bioenergy Sustainability Program and the Fairchild Challenge, an environmental education program that reaches over 100,000 children a year in Miami.<br/><br/>To understand whether mutualisms become less beneficial in the process of species invasions, this project will test the hypothesized trade-off between partner breadth and mutualism benefit across legume and rhizobium genotypes from the native and invasive range for two Medicago species. Medicago is the genus that includes alfalfa. Both species are native to Europe and invasive in the US. The researchers will 1) compare genetic diversity in native vs. invaded host range mutualists, using high marker density genotyping for hosts and whole-genome sequencing for symbionts, 2) assess divergence in mutualism properties between the native and invaded range to test hypotheses of reduced specialization, partner choice and mutualism dependence in invaded range mutualists using cross-inoculation trials, 3) test the impact of invasion on symbiont genome dynamics and mutualisms by simulated symbiont invasions in soil mesocosms under contrasting host density and diversity, and 4) identify the molecular underpinnings of mutualism specialization using a transcriptomic approach to nominate host-symbiont pathways. This research will shed light on the long-standing question of whether beneficial microbes face a trade-off between having a broad partner range and providing a high degree of benefit to a partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important events during the life cycle of organisms such as germination, flowering, hatching, and reproduction occurs during specific seasons and time of the year. The timing of these events, which is called phenology, is important because it determines when and at which developmental stage individuals of a species interact with other members of the community. Consequently, interactions among species also follow a seasonal phenology. Species phenologies are not constant but instead vary across years with changes in weather patterns (e.g. changes in temperature or rainfall). Thus, these changes in environmental conditions also lead to changes in the seasonal timing of species interactions. Although shifts in the phenology of species interactions are often observed in natural communities, they are typically neglected when studying the dynamics and structure of natural ecological communities. Yet, species interactions determine the structure and diversity of natural communities and ecosystem processes. Thus, understanding how changes in phenology affect species interactions is critical for our ability to predict the dynamics and functioning of natural communities. This knowledge is also essential to predict how environmental changes might affect ecosystems services. The proposed project will develop a broad, mechanistic framework to identify when and how variation in species phenologies will alter species interactions and their coexistence. The investigator will conduct experiments in freshwater communities and use the results to develop mathematical models. Phenologies of species are clearly changing globally as a result of environmental changes; thus, the results from this research will help anticipate the consequences of these changes. Furthermore, the findings of the study could guide plans to conserve natural and agricultural ecosystems in a changing world.  The study will also provide training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate students, and an early career scientist, including individuals from underrepresented groups in the sciences.<br/><br/>The project will use an integrative approach that combines a series of experiments in a well-studied pond community and general theoretical model. The experiments serve multiple roles. (i) They will test a new mechanistic framework that predicts how shifts in relative phenologies alter species interactions within a year/season. (ii) This will also determine when and how variation in phenologies per se (not just the mean) will alter species interactions and (iii) identify key functional relationship between species per-capita interaction strength, and how these are modified by density-dependent processes and other species. Finally (iv) the experiment will be used to develop general mathematical models which to determine and predict when and how shifts in mean and variation of species' phenologies affect long-term dynamics of communities and species coexistence in stationary and non-stationary systems."

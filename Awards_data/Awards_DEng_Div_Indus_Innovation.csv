Evidence-based research has resulted in a protocol called diabetes prevention program (DPP), taught by diabetes coaches and covered by insurance. But usage/adherence to DPP is low. 9 out of 10 patients are unaware. Programs are underutilized, patients drop off and coaches are not paid by insurance due to non-compliance.<br/><br/>The company?s technology solution will use data and behavioral science to improve usage and adherence for DPP. This solution empowers doctors, diabetes coaches and patients to collectively improve long term self-care. By identifying risk of diabetes and connecting at-risk patients to programs, the company improves usage. By helping patients adhere to programs, the company helps programs comply and get paid. The company will collect software as a service (SaaS) fee from programs by helping them with revenue generation. The company will prove its value proposition in the diabetes prevention market with well-defined goals set by CDC/Medicare and use this evidence to move to other markets beyond diabetes. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is a connected digital health platform with integrated delivery to improve patient adherence to health goals using insights from data science and behavioral science. It comprises of a web dashboard for health providers and a synced mobile app for patients. By aggregating and learning from decades of research in behavioral science, machine learning and medical adherence and combining it with connected technologies and computational power that have recently become available, the company is developing a better way to help patients adhere to their long term health goals. With smartphone usage at 77% (Pew Research, 2018), it is now easier to collect data automatically and continuously, intervene, support and track patients virtually. <br/><br/>The company is leveraging its team?s 75+ years of combined experience in healthcare, technology, behavioral psychology and entrepreneurship to tackle this challenge. The company will streamline data collection and management through wearables and connected technologies. The company will use this patient generated data to develop new predictive algorithms and visualize data to offer insights to patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, the company will implement behavioral science methodologies and tools such as gamification and nudging to reinforce healthy behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.<br/><br/>The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed approach has the potential to open a new vertical in the analytics market in which chatbots aid humans in carrying out the task of creating, deploying and running complex data science pipelines. This project could lead to the creation of a sub-market in the existing analytic software market, and it could also help improve the productivity of the (non-technology) sectors of the economy that increasingly require high-quality and fast insights from both their archival and real-time datasets.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will take on a number of technical challenges including designing and developing a method to allow programming the underlying program that powers chatbots. Another technical challenge that will be tackled is making it easy to load external data that may not have well-defined schemas. A type inferencing mechanism, and associated set of methods to learn over historical data, will be developed to address this research aspect. Another technical challenge is building good machine learning models, for which a set of mechanisms is proposed that will allow automatic exploration and ranking of machine learning models, aiding the user in picking the right model for the specific task at hand. Overall these technical components will collectively contribute to the different facets of data analysis that are needed to gather insights from data, and will power the overall chatbot approach."

ED crowding is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently, EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science, decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization, feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group.

The proposed software will provide fully automated capabilities for semi-supervised learning for anomaly detection in cyber security applications. All businesses ranging from large scale enterprises to boutique data science consulting firms will benefit from this project. The expected impact can range in the billions of dollars in the areas of cyber security and predictive maintenance, to name just two.

In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labels and thus require minimal human participation. However, due to significant technical difficulties they have not been as successful as supervised learning algorithms. This software package circumvents these difficulties and opens the way to scaling unsupervised learning algorithms to large and complex datasets.  The main research and development challenges that will be addressed in this project are the ability to integrate this new technology with real world complex datasets through the choice of the correct comparison function between the objects of the dataset and the fully automatic algorithm and algorithm parameter selection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.<br/><br/><br/>This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include obtaining the first age-frequency distributions for the US ocean quahog stock, the oldest living non-colonial animals, the first benthic survey east of Nantucket to identify a range shift in surfclams produced by climate change, a software package for evaluation of the adequacy of survey sampling design, and basic biological data on forage fish such as menhaden. These examples show the nexus between applied research directed at basic questions of fishery management and basic research directed at understanding the pelagic, demersal, and benthic realms of the continental shelf.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions."

Over the past two decades, cities have become a locus of population and economic activity. Currently, over 80% of the US population is concentrated in cities; furthermore, 80% of the Gross Domestic Product in the United States is produced in metropolitan areas. The concentration of people and economic activity makes cities even more vulnerable to extreme weather events.  Given these trends, effective hazardous weather warning systems are critical. Hazard warning systems are service systems that aim to minimize deaths, injuries, property loss, infrastructure destruction, and service or business disruption.  They include the sensors, forecasts, networking and communications, public safety personnel and decision-makers, warning information, and those who receive and respond to the warnings. <br/><br/>CityWarn addresses three important issues for hazard notification service systems:  1) Coordination and sharing. Public safety agencies, private sector firms and the general public, all have their own hazard warning needs, and over the years, sector-specific, and even hazard-specific warning systems have evolved that may not share important information in efficient and useful ways. 2) Data Explosion. There's an explosion of data from all sources, from fine scale meteorological observations and traffic data, to humans reporting weather on social media. This is challenging for decision-makers who must quickly make sense of all of this information; and 3) Smart phone penetration. There is now a proliferation of smart phones, plus a trend toward hyperlocal, user-selected information. Warning systems have the potential to personalize weather warnings in a way that can make warning response more effective. <br/><br/>CityWarn will deliver user-defined, dynamically changing alerts through a next-generation communications and networking platform. The platform is linked to a cutting edge radar system that provides high-resolution weather information on an urban scale of streets and neighborhoods. A mobile app delivers user-configured, weather information. Our integrated research will focus on Computing & Sensing, Behavioral Sciences, Engineered Systems and Testbeds. The Computing & Sensing thrust will develop new scalability, security, and functional advances within the communication and networking platform, and integrate high-resolution radar products and user-generated observations from the field. Through cognitive task analysis, usability studies, and live experiments, behavioral science researchers will learn how fieldworkers, such as utility workers, police, firefighters, stormwater personnel, use and share weather information in the context of their tasks and organizational constructs. Our engineered systems work will focus on aggregation and sharing of sensed information sources, automation of warning processes to address data overload problems, and user alert customization.  By developing a common platform for use by industry and public sector players, we hope to break down silos between existing warning systems and increase inter-agency coordination and improve response time and quality. The main test bed will be a living lab in the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex where weather data will be disseminated to users during actual severe weather events. <br/><br/>Primary partners: University of Massachusetts, Amherst (lead): Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Resource Economics; Colorado State University: Electrical & Computer Engineering; Oncor Electric Delivery Company (Large Business, Dallas, Texas);  TruWeather Solutions (Small Business, Reston, VA).

This product would fill an existing need to monitor and assess the conditions of aging US infrastructures. No existing product on the market offers real-time continuous operational fatigue prognosis and remaining life predictions, thus creating a market niche for the FHP. Full development, licensing, and commercialization of the FHP is vital as the US infrastructure ages, deteriorates and is thus increasingly ""load-posted"" (not recommended for transportation of materials and goods using heavier trucks). Load posting of bridges has major societal and commercial impact on the US market and economy and results in enormous costs of maintenance, retrofit, and replacement of the US highway bridges. An intelligent decision-oriented methodology can exploit real-time measured data and analysis, resulting in a more effective use of such information for infrastructure health monitoring and management. It will support a paradigm shift in the fatigue assessment profession to enable a data-driven and decision-oriented tool that can evolve as more structural response data is collected.<br/><br/>The target market for this methodology is bridge managers and owners concerned with limited service life due to fatigue of steel elements. The broader target market is any structural engineer interested in data-driven intelligent decision-making with respect to fatigue assessment of in-service structures, such as transmission towers or amusement park rides. Under this project, two full-scale bridges and one other structural type will be the case studies for validation of the proposed methodologies, allowing refinement of the analytical methods and experimental techniques to address challenges of commercialization. The project will result in a FHP prototype software package with proof-of-concept that meets the need for improved decision-making in infrastructure asset management. It will integrate structural health monitoring concepts, analytical fatigue life prediction, and advanced nonparametric statistical methods to enable real-time fatigue assessment and prognosis to be used for decision-making and asset management. This project addresses the following technology gaps for real-time decision-making: (1) efficient and reliable wireless sensors, data acquisition, cloud computing, and data communications, (2) nonparametric decision-oriented probabilistic operational methods for infrastructure fatigue assessments, and (3) prognosis and prediction of remaining infrastructure fatigue life. <br/><br/>The FHP has the following unique features: variable fatigue stress ranges, operational measured strains, unknown vehicle information, hypothesis testing for damage assessment, and use of an alert system that improves system safety. These features provide the following advantages: real-time structural fatigue life assessment using real-time measured strains, and use of efficient computational methodologies, which are cost effective when compared to the leading competing products and technology in this market space. This research collaboration, which involves three departments (Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Economics) at two universities (Tufts University and University of New Hampshire), will strive to include underrepresented groups at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school level (students and teachers). In addition, personnel involved in this project will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through product development, proof of concept, capstone projects, and licensing process of the IP. The academic and industrial partners of this project are looking forward to working together to transform research discoveries into market-ready products.<br/><br/>The lead institution is Tufts University with its departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, and Economics. The primary subcontractor is the University of New Hampshire, with a current PFI BIC project, The Living Bridge: The Future of Smart, User-Centered Transportation Infrastructure, which will be used for proof of concept of the FHP. Primary industrial partner is Bridge Diagnostic Inc. (BDI) to transform research discoveries into market-ready products and contact with consumers of FHP.

The project seeks to promote the progress of science by objectively evaluating and documenting the impact of I/UCRCs in order to provide the NSF with actionable, timely, data-based feedback, analysis and advice on the funded centers; and to identify and communicate I/UCRC best practices to NSF. Research and evaluation conducted through the I/UCRC Evaluation Project in the past has made a significant contribution to a broadened understanding of cooperative research in general and industry/university centers in particular.  Our work has been a pioneer in exploring important new constructs including ?unintended consequences? of cooperative research, cost-avoidance benefits of membership, organizational commitment of center faculty and program sustainability of cooperative research centers. The project has also succeeded in being a training vehicle for the next generation of science and technology evaluators by promoting high quality research opportunities for the graduate students supported by the project.  <br/>The proposed I/UCRC Evaluation Project addresses both accountability and improvement evaluation issues and involves both program-level and center-level elements. The accountability-driven element of the I/UCRC evaluation strategy focuses on collecting and reporting data on center and program-level inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts. The improvement-oriented element of the I/UCRC evaluation strategy focuses on providing relatively real-time feedback on collected data to NSF (and local centers) to aid improvement and document best practices.  The evaluation effort reports to NSF and involves collection of data on I/UCRC inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts. We will address a number of new evaluation issues including integration of program-level data collection and databases with NSF internal efforts, and other support for the development of the NSF?s new I/UCRC evaluation model. The center-level evaluation depends on a team of on-site assessment coordinators who collect data at their site and provide feedback on their findings to the NSF. We will provide data analysis and reporting of this data for national benchmarking and other purposes."

CARFS will initially include digital forensics/data analytics (USA), forensic chemistry (FIU/NE/GWU), forensic molecular biology (FIU/GWU), and forensic microbiology (TAMU/UNT), with the possibility of future expansion to include other forensic disciplines. The Center is anticipated to provide new findings and tools to a range of stakeholders, including forensic science practitioners, research laboratories, industrial partners, and government and private forensic science end users, and will ultimately support safety and justice for the nation. The Center's research sites will also provide training opportunities to a diverse group of students, thus supporting the pipeline of future forensic researchers.<br/><br/>As part of CARFS, the USA site, including affiliates at TAMU and UNTHSC, will focus on digital and microbial forensics. At USA, research will focus on Digital Forensic Information Intelligence, including the development, testing, and implementation of novel approaches to understand not only how devices, information systems, and software can be compromised, but also how one can reliably determine how those compromises occurred. The research will support the development of new technologies with potentially cross cutting industry impact: (1) mobile devices, (2) additive manufacturing, (3) medical devices, (4) transportation systems, as well as (5) generation and storage of large scale data sets (forensic microbiology). At TAMU and UNTHSC, research will focus on forensically important phenomena of decomposition and ecological recycling of vertebrate carrion, to support human identification and source attribution; taphonomy; counterterrorism/drug interdiction; and validation services.

Such data displays could include arbitrary database queries, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, and bar charts, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. Using the proposed software, organizations can decrease time spent on administrative and managerial tasks, improve the use of data in decision-making, and, in many cases, eliminate yearlong internal software development projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings.

The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery) that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school).

In contrast to two-dimensional images produced by conventional color cameras usually with three-color channels, hyperspectral techniques generate three-dimensional datasets known as datacubes with both spatial and spectral dimensions with hundreds of color channels. Hyperspectral methods lead to a vastly improved ability to classify and differentiate objects based on their spectral features enabling small, otherwise unnoticeable, features to be amplified. The societal impact of hyperspectral imaging is rapidly expanding and includes the development of advanced medical diagnostic tools, systems for precision agriculture, methods to ensure food quality, discovery of new minerals, and the evolution of national defense projects. However, despite the progress in analysis method development and computational speed, efficient computational approaches suitable for rapid analysis of datacubes are still lacking. Three-dimensionality of data and large file size presents a significant challenge for isolation of useful data, and consequently individual investigators developing their own tools. The development of an advanced and commercially available software package for hyperspectral data analysis will facilitate this work and enable users to search for new optical signatures across multiple applications.  <br/><br/>The proposed project sets a new software architecture that is capable of analyzing complex and computationally challenging datasets recorded by hyperspectral imaging systems. The proposed computational platform for data analysis of hyperspectral data will provide a unique and powerful tool to process hyperspectral data for a variety of applications: from medicine and remote vision to forensics and plants science. The research objective is to integrate current and new analysis methods into an interactive, fast, and intuitive hyperspectral imaging software that will offer an unprecedented level of flexibility in hyperspectral data processing. The proposed software program will be designed to be operated without any prior programming skills allowing interactive sessions of raw and processed data to be easily shared, explored and evaluated by both peers and newcomers. The major feature of the software is an open architecture that provides a common framework for the implementation of the additional methods from the user community. The commercially available platform will have structural flexibility to allow users to integrate their novel computational methods with relatively little effort. With this feature, the software is expected to be a central part of hyperspectral technology and will be the preferred software of the majority of users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.<br/><br/>This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry.

Nanoparticles are being used in more and more commercial and industrial products while their health and environmental implications are still under debate. The toxicity of nanomaterials not only varies among different materials, but is also highly dependent on the dose of exposure. Developing a sensitive method to detect the release and spatio-temporal distribution of nanoparticles in the environment as well as in daily lives is a high priority before their toxicity effects are fully understood via long-term toxicological studies. Despite this urgent need for widespread detection and quantification of nanoparticle distributions, current technologies are lacking appropriate features for ubiquitous and cost-effective mapping and quantification of nanoparticle contamination. This project aims to create a transformative and human-centered toolset for on-site and ubiquitous quantification and automated characterization of nanomaterials found in houses, workplaces and the environment based on the cost-effective integration of computational imaging and mobile sensing techniques with big data based dynamic machine learning algorithms. <br/><br/>The central challenge in this project is to translate the bulky and expensive laboratory equipment currently used for nanoparticle quantification and characterization to field-portable, easy-to-use, cost-effective, and rapid analysis devices and smart service systems aiming to be massively used by consumers in their daily routines. To solve this challenge, highly sensitive optical imaging systems will be developed based on mass-produced Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor chips embedded in mobile phones with extraordinary signal to noise ratios (SNR) and large fields-of-view for high-throughput machine learning based automated nanoparticle analysis and classification. One approach this will take is to combine computational microscopy with self-assembled nanolenses around nanoparticles that significantly enhance imaging SNR and contrast. The aim of this approach is to enable automated detection and sizing of individual nanoparticles, mono-dispersed samples, and complex poly-dispersed mixtures, where the sample concentrations can span ~5 orders-of-magnitude and particle sizes can range from 40 nm to millimeter-scale, which provide unmatched performance metrics compared to existing nanoparticle sizing approaches. Another approach that will be implemented is the development of highly sensitive multi-modal (e.g. fluorescence plus dark-field) mobile phone based microscopy platforms for distributed nanoparticle imaging and sensing. Furthermore, in terms of big data analysis and machine learning tools, the techniques in this project can adaptively learn ""semantic"" similarities that can be used for more accurate data classification. These techniques are unlike existing techniques developed so far in the literature.  The extant technologies are based only on signal similarities, which do not work well on multi-modality data. The smart and adaptive methods of this project are the first in the literature that come with confidence bounds, that is, they not only have the capability to accurately classify the information, but they also provide guarantees about the accuracy of this classification, which is quite important for self-learning smart service systems. Through these field-portable devices that are integrated with adaptive big data based decision analytics and quantification algorithms, spatio-temporal maps of nanoparticle concentrations and size distributions in various consumer samples will be created for public or personal monitoring (e.g., measurements of waterborne/airborne particles at home, workplace, or airborne particles along a freeway, etc.).<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this transformative research include (1) The development of these nanoparticle sensing and quantification platforms and smart service systems will extend the boundaries of current optical metrology science, resulting in new advances in the fields of nanophotonics and optical microscopy (2) These devices will also be easy to translate into various biomedical, chemical and material science applications, significantly impacting the use and regulations of nanotechnologies in consumer market and related products. (3) This project would deliver a paradigm-shift by ubiquitous quantification and spatiotemporal mapping/monitoring of nanoparticle contamination and exposure even in non-laboratory settings, assisting in the revelation and better understanding of various cause-effect relationships at the consumer level that have remained unidentified so far due to the limitations of existing nano-imaging, detection and quantification technologies, also providing maps of potential health risks.

Meeting the global demand for earth resources represents a grand challenge. The Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Subsurface Earth Resource Models is a collaborative effort between Virginia Tech, Colorado School of Mines, and industry partners. The Center's activities will transform the way geoscience data are used in the exploration and mining industry sector, beginning with the mineral exploration stage and continuing through mine closure and environmental remediation. Research activities of the Center will fundamentally change the way global exploration and mining of natural resources is done, replacing industry experience- and empiricism-based decisions with innovative science and technology-based solutions that inform decision making, increase the chances of exploration success, and reduce financial risk. The goals of the Center will promote socio-economic prosperity and help to reduce the environmental impact of mining. Workforce development is an essential component of the Center activities and will include graduate and undergraduate students, and industry employee participation in research activities and training opportunities. The Center will strengthen and promote cross-disciplinary discoveries in geophysics, geochemistry, mineralogy, computational science and statistics. Knowledge transfer to the geothermal industry sector will form one of the Center?s key activities.<br/><br/>The Center for Advanced Subsurface Earth Resource Models is focused on advancing the exploration/mining industry sector through the establishment of a cooperative partnership that conducts pre-competitive research and workforce development of benefit to industry, academia, and society. The purpose and long-term vision of this Center is directed toward research challenges in the development of 3-D subsurface geologic models for mineral deposits, integrating diverse geoscience data, to inform decision making and minimize geological risk. Four research thrusts are envisioned: (1) development of geophysical and geochemical instrumentation, analysis and interpretation methods for enhanced characterization of rock properties; (2) integration, scaling, and inversion of diverse geological, petrophysical, and geophysical data of dissimilar spatial resolution and distribution to identify and characterize subsurface earth resources; (3) development of information methodologies for reducing risk associated with decision making; and (4) computational imaging and development of graphical and exploratory data analysis solutions and visualization tools. Achieving this broad vision requires collaborations from a broad range of disciplines. Virginia Tech's broad expertise in computational methods, high performance computing, mining engineering, fluids, seismic acquisition, imaging and inversion, tomographic imaging, and petrophysics combined with industry experience will allow for further mining-related advancements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new ""Superstar"" for today's youth. Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and/or junior high school students' analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding.  Given the DJ tool's relation to these topics as well as music's inherent link with physics and math, its integration into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues. Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness in the music/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth, enhanced engagement in STEM fields.<br/> <br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence, tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog/digital educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment's most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities. The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction, and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable. The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the elements captured from the DJ musician and translate these into a commercially and educationally viable platform."

Many current practices in drug discovery and manufacturing are century-old, resulting in poor quality, poor patient compliance, poor scalability, and scarcity of many medicines. The proposed approach differs radically from existing practices in the pharmaceutical sector, enhances the properties of active ingre-dients in medicines, drives down the amount of solvents required for pre-clinical testing and thus reducing toxic chemical waste, yet is compatible with many existing drugs and dosage forms (e.g. pills, gel caps, patches, injections, etc.). If successful, the proposed technology could short-en by several years the drug development timeline, make it easier to combine multiple med-icines into a single pill or patch tailored to each patient, and reduce the amount of precious active ingredient being wasted due to body elimination or unused prescription medicines. <br/><br/>The proposed project has significant intellectual merit, in that it leverages techniques from the semiconductor industry and nanotechnology to address long-standing problems in pharmaceutical science, development, and manufacturing. The process at the core of this project can print active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with precision and accuracy, while also enhancing their dissolution without resorting to strong or toxic solvents. It will advance understanding of thermal properties of pharmaceutical compounds, the link between molecular structure and crystal structure, and its influence on dissolution properties and bioa-vailability, which it enhances. While these capabilities have been shown for some compounds, they remain unavailable to the broader pharma research community. This multi-disciplinary project will make the capability widely available to molecular chemists, biologists, and pharmacologists, allowing them to devote more of their time to optimizing small molecular therapeutics for potency and site-specific binding, without facing solubility bottlenecks. The proposed work promises to unlock the therapeutic potential of millions of al-ready synthesized compounds that are languishing in material libraries due to their poor solubility, and to create combination therapies of unprecedented sophistication that will leverage deep learning- and data-driven medical science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research addresses the needs of a large community of people who rely on public transportation for independent mobility, and yet face difficulties using it. For someone with poor vision or blindness, some level of cognitive impairment, or for a senior citizen, taking a bus on an unfamiliar route can become a challenge and a source of anxiety.  The problem is often one of scarce access to relevant information such as which bus to catch, which platform to wait on for a train, when to exit the vehicle and how to negotiate a transfer.  The smart service system will facilitate and promote use of mass transit systems as passengers, or their assistants, will be able to pre-register a trip, possibly involving multiple legs and different means of transportation from multiple agencies. It is envisioned that during the trip, passengers will receive context-aware information that will help ensure that they are waiting for a bus or a train in the right location; they are entering the desired bus vehicle or train car, and that they exit the vehicle at the correct stop or station. Importantly, authorized users (family members, friends, or assistants) will be able to monitor the user's trip remotely, and receive warnings when an unexpected situation occurs (e.g., when a user is waiting for a train in the wrong platform, enters the wrong bus, or is stuck at a certain location). Anonymized data about travelers can be relayed to the transit agency for enhanced service; for example, a bus driver can be informed that a blind passenger is waiting for the bus at a certain stop. RouteMe2 will promote increased travel independence, and thus increased opportunities for education, employment, socialization, participation, and leisure. It is expected that designing this type of human-centered technology with a clear societal benefit, and interacting with the participants in the user studies will be an inspirational and rewarding experience for the students involved in this research.<br/><br/><br/>This technology will rely on interconnected sensors that can track a passenger during a trip, and on services that can provide just-in-time information to passengers on smartphones. This project will develop and experiment with a sensor and information infrastructure specifically designed to assist individuals with special needs while taking public transportation.  The RouteMe2 system will rely essentially on cloud services, complemented with location data from an infrastructure of economical, miniaturized sensors (iBeacons), as well as data from the smartphone carried by the user, such as data generated by its GPS and inertial sensors. Individuals from different communities of potential users of this system (senior citizens and people with visual or cognitive impairments) will contribute to system design by means of initial focus groups, and will test it with a series of carefully designed user studies. <br/><br/>This project is a partnership between the University of California, Santa Cruz (lead institution) with faculty and students from  its departments of Computer Engineering, Computer Science,  Computational Media and Environmental Studies with IBM Research as primary industrial partner (Almaden, CA; large business) participating with its Cloud, IoT & Systems Lifecycle Analytics Group.

Vibrio cholerae is a well-known freshwater pathogen that is of concern in developing countries.  Two lesser known, but important human pathogens in the USA are from the same bacterial group: Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.  These are bacteria that are naturally found in estuarine systems, but they can also present a risk to human health when consumed in raw shellfish, or in rare cases, contacted in beach waters.  This project will translate knowledge gained through prior ecological research into technology that permits the design of user-friendly, rapid, molecular testing kits.  The existing ways to test for Vibrio species in water and shellfish samples are decades old, and they require 24-96 hours for results.  Even new molecular approaches  for testing of pathogenic forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are compromised by a lack of specificity and/or a need for an enrichment step to improve sensitivity, making them require almost a day for completion. This project will permit generation of new, rapid molecular diagnostics for virulent forms of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus using a new approach for determining useful targets for the kits. It is envisioned that these kits could be used to 1) certify that shellfish is safe for raw consumption, 2) protect the health of at risk populations for water contact, 3) determine the patterns associated with dangerous forms of the bacteria for improved warning systems. The funded project will result in the design of commercially available molecular testing kits that will be easy to use, and will provide results in 2-3 hours.  These features will permit accurate public notification and protection of public health.<br/><br/>This project addresses a specific knowledge gap in the transition from research to commercial application.  Vibrio sp. are complex bacterial organisms, that are naturally found in estuarine and coastal waters, but only a small subset of them are capable of causing disease.  The assembled team has valuable expertise in next generation sequence and sequence data approaches, Vibrio sp. ecology, and Vibrio sp. pathogenicity. The combination of knowledge permits known virulent (pathogenic) Vibrio samples to be analyzed for specific sets of  ""DNA motifs"" that are related to the capability of the bacteria to cause disease.  From a repetitive process of analyzing known virulent and avirulent cells, the project team can identify the DNA motifs, or signatures that can be used to design a DNA test kit.  Subsequently, through support from this project the molecular test kits will be developed, optimized, validated, and commercialized.<br/><br/>In addition to the technical activities, undergraduates, senior graduate students, and post doctoral research associates as well as research assistant professors will be supported on this project. The will be exposed to a wide range of research and technology transfer activities, including market assessment, field based sampling and study, laboratory sample preparation, culture and molecular based analyses of samples, next generation sequence data annotation and analyses, and kit design and optimization. The project will be synergistic and contribute directly to the Molecular Training Facility run by PI Noble, where water quality professionals come to learn appropriate use of qPCR approaches and interpretation of qPCR data for water quality management.<br/><br/> The project also engages the Marine Biotechnologies-Center of Innovation, a group dedicated to advancing the translation of marine science research to commercial application.  In addition, Orion Integrated Biosciences is a project partner.  Orion Integrated Biosciences is a company dedicated to the advancement of unique and disruptive computational approaches to survey ""big data"" for sequence and molecular application. This project will directly impact the advancement of marine metagenomics due to the fact that the project team is utilizing a holistic approach to target complex organisms. The project is novel in that the approach moves away from the ""single gene target"" qPCR design approach, permitting the generation of diagnostic kits that are rapid, and cost-effective that shellfish harvesting, and water quality managers can use to manage precious resources and protect public health."

One in eight people in America struggle with hunger. Food banks try to connect excess food to these families in need but face many challenges. The true need is uncertain; donated food has a limited shelf life; warehouse networks and receiving agencies have capacity constraints; and the donated food supply is unpredictable in timing, quantity, and quality. These challenges are becoming increasingly complex as food banks must distribute food equitably to those in need, efficiently maximize donated supply, minimize waste and distribute food in a cost effective manner. The existing tools used by food banks provide information to facilitate all levels of decision making but are limited in their ability to (i) provide a comprehensive picture; (ii) recommend improvements; and (iii) learn from and respond to the highly dynamic and uncertain environment. FEEED will synthesize data from various sources to automatically predict, visualize, learn from decision maker?s actions, and identify strategies to advance operational effectiveness of food collection, distribution, and resource management and fundamentally transform the way food banks operate.<br/><br/>FEEED advances the management of complex dynamic distribution systems that require intelligence to effectively utilize data to improve decision making. This research project will involve the exploration and development of: (1) a novel, stochastic modeling framework to adapt to the dynamically changing objectives of the human decision maker, thus enabling the system to learn over time and more effectively recommend solutions tailored to the decision maker's preferences; (2) an intelligent operational guidance engine and knowledge base that help food bank staff operationalize complex modeling into their daily processes; (3) a framework for synthesizing and managing big data in the humanitarian relief sector; and (4) human/machine communication modalities that facilitate user understanding and visualization of smart system analysis, predictions and recommendations. This research addresses the critical intersection of humanitarian relief, engineering, computer science and industry by linking donations management and food distribution to supply chain management and forges a relationship necessary to address this significant global challenge.

Bridges deliver such a fundamental service to society that they are often taken for granted. Typically, bridges only stir the public's interest when they must unexpectedly be replaced at great cost, or, worse, fail. The Living Bridge project will create a self-diagnosing, self-reporting ""smart bridge"" powered by a local renewable energy source, tidal energy, by transforming the landmark Memorial Bridge--a vertical lift bridge over the tidal Piscataqua River, with pedestrian access connecting Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Kittery, Maine--into a living laboratory for researchers, engineers, scientists, and the community at large. The Living Bridge will engage innovators in sensor and renewable energy technology by creating an incubator platform on a working bridge, from which researchers can field test and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of emerging technologies. The Living Bridge will also serve as a community platform to educate citizens about innovations occurring at the site and in the region, and about how incorporating renewable energy into bridge design can lead to a sustainable transportation infrastructure with impact far beyond the region. <br/><br/>Sustainable, smart bridges are key elements in developing a successful infrastructure system. To advance the state of smart service systems and clean energy conversion, this project team will design and deploy a structural and environmental monitoring system that provides information for bridge condition assessment, traffic management, and environmental stewardship; advances renewable energy technology application; and excites the general public about bridge innovations. This PFI:BIC project is enabled through partnerships between academic researchers with expertise in structural, mechanical and ocean engineering, sensing technology and social science; small businesses with expertise in instrumentation, data acquisition, tidal energy conversion; and state agencies with bridge design expertise. The Living Bridge technical areas are structural health monitoring, tidal energy conversion with fluid-structure interaction measurements, estuarine environmental monitoring, and outreach communication. Sensors will be used to calibrate a three-dimensional analytical structural finite element model of the bridge. The predicted structural response from this model will assess the measured structural response of the bridge as acceptable or not. Instruments installed on the turbine deployment platform will measure the spatio-temporal structure of the turbulent inflow and modified wake flow downstream of the turbine. Resulting data will include turbine performance and loads for use in fluid-structure interaction models. Deployed environmental sensors will measure estuarine water quality; wildlife deterrent sensors will deter fish from the turbine. Hydrophones and video cameras will be used before and during turbine deployment to monitor environmental changes due to turbine presence. Outreach efforts will make bridge data, history, and information about new systems accessible and understandable to the public and K-12 educators, facilitated by an information kiosk installed at the bridge.

The method has growing importance in basic life science research and in the pharmaceutical sector for defining how drugs interact with their targets. Cryo-EM as a whole has matured into a powerful tool in recent years, culminating in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but the process of protein 'sample preparation' for 3D study has not advanced appreciably and is widely considered to represent the major bottleneck in the overall method. This bottleneck also presents a major commercial opportunity. The present project advances new nanofluidic-based technology aimed at addressing this bottleneck. Successful development of this technology will yield a consumable product ready for commercialization. Fulfillment of this goal will greatly advance and open new possibilities in cryo-EM structure determination. The resulting acceleration and enhancement of basic science and drug discovery would translate to broad societal benefit.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project advances a new technology, supported by prototype data, to breach the major bottleneck in the rapidly growing cryo-EM field, with broad impact in life science and drug discovery. Cryo-EM is performed by taking images of frozen proteins using an electron microscope, then processing the images with a computer to obtain a 3D protein structure. To image and obtain a structure, the protein sample must first be frozen into a thin layer (~50-200 nm). With existing technology, this process is poorly controlled, lacks reproducibility and substantially adds to the time required to get a structure. Our device is designed to directly mitigate these sample preparation problems. It is a self-contained, freezable fluid cell nanofabricated to specification, giving full control over sample geometry and protein environment. Protein is passively loaded into the fluid cell, the loaded device is frozen, and can then be imaged directly. Materials on the top and bottom of the fluid cell are selected to transmit the electron beam through the protein sample with minimal noise. Successful prototype testing and data collection has shown the viability of the core design, with future work focused on refining the design and materials and streamlining manufacturing for eventual commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this way, the health and security of the US are positively impacted.<br/><br/>     As AMBIC investigators develop new and enhanced production processes, cell lines, cell growth media, and process analytical technologies, a state-of-the-art bioprocessing suite within the University of Maryland (UMD) Site and joint with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will be used as a recognized testbed. AMBIC researchers will also work with Maryland's Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI), a regulatory science research center joint with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Scores of biopharmaceuticals companies have biotherapeutics products that are regulated by the FDA and rely on standards and measurements enabled by NIST. The UMD Site helps to integrate these federal agencies into the AMBIC center. The UMD Site will also bring powerful new analytical methodologies including wireless real time process data acquisition and in situ product measurement tools for embedding into advanced reactor control methodologies. Perhaps most importantly, a diverse set of students from a variety of academic backgrounds (chemistry, materials science, chemical and bioengineering, process control) working to advance manufacturing practice will be readily accepted by the industry and will be the catalyst for its future. As AMBIC grows, owing to many participants throughout the US working together to chart the future, it will be a focal point for U.S. biomanufacturing for the next two decades.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the following Programs:<br/>Cellular & Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical Biochemical Environment and Transport (CBET) - Engineering (ENG) Directorate.<br/>Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) - Biological Sciences Directorate .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date."

Many of these communities do not have the resources to improve the treatment system or comply with new discharge regulations. While most wastewater treatment plants are fully automated, including small plants, their susceptibility to failure are high and their ability to quickly recover and resume operation are low. In this project the research team will be developing an innovative smart monitoring and control system to provide early detection of wastewater treatment system failure at small facilities and low-cost, remote monitoring and control systems for small, decentralized wastewater treatment systems.<br/><br/>Water reclamation and reuse is not new, but discussions about new paradigms in water reuse, such as direct potable reuse, are accelerating across the country. Thus, when the source of water is explicitly impaired and it is destined to become drinking water, or even water for other beneficial applications, monitoring of water quality, early warning of treatment system failure, responsive operation, and an informed public are all critical to securing future water resources and protecting the public and the environment. A smart sensor network supported by smart data acquisition/processing and system-learning programs will ensure that next generation wastewater treatment systems can operate sustainably and continuously without negative impact on people and the environment. More than ever, plant operators and the public are highly informed and must have better tools to understand water quality and economics of domestic water reuse, and the negative impacts of water contamination. The human-centered system that will be developed through this project will provide these tools and stimulate energy efficiency system behaviors.<br/><br/>A unique testbed will be used to conduct this research. It consists of an advance sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SB-MBR) hybrid system treating >7,000 gal/day of real domestic wastewater. The research team will use this platform to integrate existing and new wireless sensor networks to monitor water quality and for process monitoring and control, to facilitate and test the development of a smart data acquisition/processing and self-learning control system. The smart service system will enable early warning of wastewater treatment plant failure, thus preventing long-term recovery and negative impact on community services. The testbed has five distinctive components: a demo-scale, advanced water reclamation system, a novel sensor network incorporating cutting edge analytical probes and instruments, a novel data processing and self-learning control system, energy management optimization module, and a public interaction center. It will also enable treatment of water to different end quality to produce water for different reuse applications (i.e., tailored water reuse). This new generation, smart system for tailored water reuse will have flexible and adaptable control systems that utilize new, smart sensor technologies, which interact with each other, learn from past performance, and can predict future performance and adapt the system to achieve preset objectives.

IVF is currently the most effective treatment for infertility, but success rates for IVF remain low, with only ~30% of cycles resulting in live birth which, in turn, leads to high financial and emotional costs. Improving the success rate of IVF would help IVF patients and the approximately 10% of couples who suffer from infertility, and would lead to broad societal and economic benefit. The proposed work makes use of advanced imaging and computational image analysis, and has a tight integration between biology, physics, engineering, clinical medicine, and commercialization. Undergraduate, graduate students, and postdocs, will benefit from this interdisciplinary environment and training. This effort will help increase the involvement of women and underrepresented minorities in science, innovation, and technological commercialization.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project tests and develops the use of metabolic imaging as a means to non-invasively measure oocyte quality. Metabolic imaging of oocytes holds great promise for improving IVF success rates: the current inability to determine oocyte quality is one of the major impediments to better IVF treatment, and oocyte quality is believed to be determined by oocyte metabolism. Previous and preliminary data demonstrated that metabolic imaging does not harm mouse oocytes and that it can be used to measure biologically meaningful metabolic differences between different mouse oocytes. The proposed project will expand on that work to investigate the safety and utility of the technology on in vitro matured human oocytes (clinically useless, otherwise discarded material). It is necessary to perform such safety tests before attempting to use metabolic imaging in a clinical setting. This work will also provide information on the metabolism of human oocytes, which is of fundamental import, with broad application for development, infertility, and birth defects. Furthermore, a clinical instrument must be robust and integrate into the clinical workflow. A key challenge is image and data analysis.

Members of these communities are more likely to visit hospital emergency departments with advanced stages of oral disease that need surgical treatment; this increases the cost of dental care for families and burdens hospital resources. Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in American children and adolescents age 6-19 despite being a preventable disease. In 2010, untreated tooth decay, or caries, affected 2.4 billion people worldwide. Early childhood caries leads to pain, infection, and discomfort.

The wand, which uses a safe optical scanning method, will send data and images to a dentist, who will be able to monitor how well dental treatments are working. The data and images collected by the device can be analyzed to discover where plaque and bacteria are present, providing a way to predict, and then prevent, disease. The wand will be able to prompt the user to address problem areas. This system, which will connect remote users to a dental provider, has the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of oral disease and the quality of life for people who do not have convenient access to regular, in-person dental care. <br/><br/>To enable this vision, this project will develop a smart system that offers screening, surveillance, and prediction for people to improve their oral health and prevent disease.

The bacterial measurement is performed with a hand-held single wavelength optical scanning probe that forms images from both reflectance and fluorescence contrast, with the option of taking laser-induced fluorescence spectra for diagnosis of enamel demineralization. To provide a smart interface, the optical information will be analyzed to identify trends, a new modality for the dental field. With analyses of the fluorescence signal from the plaque deposits displayed as a trend, the user, in collaboration with clinician, can monitor variations in oral health and the effectiveness of treatments. The research team will use an iterative process to develop, design, evaluate, and refine the tool. The tool will be tested for three scenarios: (1) a plaque- and caries-screening program for a trained lay user on an untrained ""patient"" (e.g., parent for a child, school nurse for pupils, pediatrician for young children, or staff at a remote rural clinic for patients); (2) a caries surveillance program for trained lay users electronically connected to a dentist who can guide the use of the tool; and (3) a caries prediction program, initially for clinical users. <br/><br/>This project brings together a multidisciplinary team from the University of Washington (UW), in Seattle, Washington, with expertise in human centered design, engineering, sensing and machine learning, oral biology, and dentistry: Eric J. Seibel (Principal Investigator, PI), Mechanical Engineering; Sean Munson (co-PI), Human Centered Design & Engineering; Shwetak Patel, Computer Science & Engineering; Zheng Xu, DDS, School of Dentistry, Pediatric Dentistry; Jeff McLean, School of Dentistry, Periodontics. Lead industry partner Water Pik, Inc. (Fort Collins, CO), brings experience and knowledge about building, marketing, and distributing advanced dental devices to consumers: Deborah Lyle, Director of Professional & Clinical Affairs, and Jay McCulloch, Vice President, Global Marketing, Oral Care.

The proposed product will help law enforcement officers at municipal, county, state and federal levels discover clandestine human burials thereby aiding in the solution of crimes and enhancing public safety.  Likewise, applications in the military arena would enable discovery of the remains of soldiers missing in action (MIAs), mass graves created during genocide, and other casualties of conflict.  Because the technology of the product has a very general capability, a product based on the same hardware and software may be customized for a variety of commercial applications.  These include: (1) environmental mapping and remediation efforts; (2) cultural resource or heritage management, e.g., by documenting Native American burial grounds; (3) characterization of soil chemistry for agribusiness applications; (4) mapping of sites in archaeology.  All of these applications would create greater demand with resulting commercial and employment opportunities.  Finally, since successful applications will receive media attention, they will provide the opportunity to educate the public about the nature of the science, the value of scientific research to the public good, and technology involved in the product.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project involves a novel adaptation of existing technologies (spectroscopy, push-probe soil tests) to a new application within forensic science.  The basic concepts of the technologies are well-established.  The product, a robotic mobile device, pushes a probe into the ground at the test locations.  The probe has a window that allows the soil to be illuminated with visible and near infrared light.  Reflected light is collected by fiber optics which carry the light to the surface to be analyzed.  The fraction of each color of light that is absorbed by the soil carries the signature of the chemical content of the soil at each underground location.  These data are then interpreted in terms of the decay products (mainly fatty acids) that indicate the presence of human cadavers.  PI?s earlier research was successful in identifying burials in both controlled mock crime scenes and in real forensic contexts involving disturbed human graves.  The proposed product will provide real-time, reliable interpretation of the data to indicate the presence of a 'hit', an essential part of the value proposition of the product for law enforcement applications.  This marks a very significant improvement over current lab-based analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The multimodal membranes are important because they will help to get biologics to market faster where they are needed to service the large and growing population of patients with long-term, chronic conditions such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. The project will result in research-scale, cation-exchange multimodal membrane chromatography (CEX-MMC) column prototypes. This CEX-MMC column has the following unique features: rapid purification of biologics, tolerance of feedstock ionic strength, high biologics binding capacity, and disposability. These features increase productivity and decrease purification costs of biologics by reducing processing times and number of steps, the costs of consumables, and fixed capital expenses when compared to the leading competing chromatography columns in this market space.  Market entry will result from use of these products in research and early stage development laboratories, where purification speed is essential and customers are willing to try new technologies.<br/><br/>This project addresses remaining technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The first generation CEX-MMC developed in the NSF lineage award demonstrated unprecedented protein binding capacity at high ionic strength. Dynamic binding capacity results showed that the CEX-MMC column has high productivity; however, protein binding kinetics must be improved. In this project, new membrane coatings will be designed to enhance protein binding kinetics. In addition, nearly all performance data have been collected using pure-component protein solutions and low titer cell culture supernatant, and almost no work has been done to quantify biological activity of the product or removal of aggregates and other impurities. In this project, antibody media will be prepared using commercial cell lines and used to collect these essential performance data. Two biopharmaceutical companies have committed to collaboration for assessing the performance of the prototypes using industry representative process parameters and monoclonal antibody feed streams. Evaluation of protein recovery, purity, and removal of protein aggregates will be measured following the CEX-MMC column purification step. These are critical performance measures that need to be determined for the Minimally Viable Product (MVP) prior to commercialization. <br/><br/>Strategic commercialization and educational plans are designed to validate remaining parts of the business model canvas and create new networks among inventors, entrepreneurs, potential investors and potential customers. Broader impacts also include training graduate and undergraduate students to better understand technology commercialization and entrepreneurship and pursue careers developing new purification technologies for biomanufacturing. Graduate and undergraduate students will attend lectures on technology commercialization held at CUBEInC, Clemson University's life science incubator. A collateral benefit of these lectures is that they will give all project personnel regular opportunities for direct communication with business leaders; entrepreneurs; and potential partners, customers, and investors in the life sciences. Students also will complete a course on technology commercialization designed for engineering students. MBA students will advance understanding of the market value, space, potential customers, and competition landscape and seek collaborations for launch with selected industry partners; and evaluate potential distribution channels and estimate the associated costs. The team will use this knowledge continually to refine the overall strategy for translation of the research discoveries onto a path towards commercialization."

Unfortunately, group meetings suffer from serious problems that undermine productivity and collegiality, including overt or unconscious bias, ""groupthink"", fear of speaking, and unfocused discussion.  Few automatic tools exist for keeping meetings on track, accurately recording who said what, and making group discussions more productive.  The goal of this research is to design intelligent rooms that provide facilitation services by identifying meeting participants, understand their conversations, summarize discussions, and help the group efficiently get through an agenda, all without requiring the participants to wear microphones or other sensors.   <br/><br/>The research will have broader impacts in several aspects.  Any steps to make group meetings for complex, long-term projects more productive and easier to control would result in immediate economic impact.  The success of a service system that facilitates long-term group interactions will result in a major opportunity for technology transfer and a highly marketable hardware/software platform for collaboration in domains including business, education, and finance.  The project will result in new group meeting data to be used by researchers in different fields such as organizational psychologists, and computer scientists.  Finally, the project will produce highly visible infrastructure for research and education that has the potential for greater public engagement with science and technology.<br/><br/>The research will be realized at different scales in two existing physical testbeds: the Smart Conference Room (SCR) at the Engineering Research Center for Lighting Enabled Systems and Applications (LESA) and the Collaborative Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Lab (CRAIVE-Lab), a much larger space with a tall, panoramic screen.  Both testbeds will be expanded as part of this project to integrate sensing and computing technologies developed by the partners.  The major technology modules include:  (1) advanced time-of-flight sensors for robust occupant tracking, resulting in centimeter-accurate, real-time locations of all participants in the meeting without requiring video cameras or wearable sensors; (2) custom beamforming microphone arrays for acoustical tracking and sound source separation, allowing highly-directional beams to be directed at each participant's instantaneous location, clearly isolating their speech without requiring lapel or headset microphones; (3) natural language understanding algorithms for extracting knowledge from the speech, enabling the system to learn meeting-specific terminology, link concepts, assess speaker roles, and summarize discussion; and (4) cognitive computing tools for meeting facilitation, including assessments of participation and productivity, ideation interventions for brainstorming, and active decision support.  The resulting service systems will be cognitive physical environments that understand their occupants' locations, movement, speech, vocabulary, and intentions. A key aspect of the research is a multi-year study that tracks technical research groups that hold regular, unscripted meetings in the testbeds, assessing the effectiveness of the service system.  <br/><br/>The lead institution for the project is Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, with investigators from the departments of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Computer Science, and Architecture.

Research has shown that early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible, and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded instruction. <br/><br/><br/>This project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented. However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate, leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The efforts targets a proxy crop, snap bean, and three proxy applications prioritized by our industry partners as key to their commercial efforts, namely disease risk modeling, harvest timing/scheduling, and yield prediction to propel FARMS into a sustainable innovation ecosystem. This is essential, since although the UAS agricultural market is pegged at US$34.2B globally, the USA is lagging due to past restrictions on commercial UAS flights. The FARMS Alliance will find fertile ground for growth in Upstate NY, where the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council has identified agriculture as a strategic growth area. This effort will afford the Finger Lakes region an opportunity to be a hub in the Eastern USA for agriculture and food production and with coordination, will lead to leadership and growth in the industry. Finally, at least four imaging science and six business graduate students will be trained at the nexus of imaging-precision-agriculture-business, equipped as truly trans-disciplinary scientists and managers.<br/><br/>The proposed project will contribute significantly to the identification of both spectral (color) and structural (3D) signatures from UAs platforms that are coupled to specific precision agriculture applications. We will improve on the relatively simple and generic current approaches, and develop new methods to distill oversampled UAS remote sensing data to the essence of metrics required for each application. This close collaboration between imaging scientists and plant physiologists will lead to turn-key, specific (optimized) solutions for our industry partners, to then market to the burgeoning precision agriculture economy. In short, expensive UAS systems will be used to derive commercial, affordable, and practical UAS solutions that can transition to the precision agriculture sector.  Finally, this approach will hedge consistent, reliable image processing via proper spectral calibration of the target scene and the instruments themselves - this sets the FARMS Alliance apart from similar, simple spectral metric solutions that currently are being offered by precision agriculture service providers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.<br/><br/><br/>This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age.

Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs.

Cortisol is a biomarker used for stress evaluation in human subjects. Increased cortisol levels have been linked to stress-related diseases, including chronic fatigue syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Therefore accurate measurement of cortisol in saliva, and sweat, is gaining increasing clinical significance to predict multiple physical and mental diseases. While existing laboratory techniques, such as ELISA and FIA, can provide precise cortisol measurements, they are generally too slow, where a rapid response or intervention is needed. The proposed technology overcomes significant limitations such as the necessity of having specified sample volume to perform a test, total testing time, and expensive optical detection unit. The substantial advantage of the proposed technology is to produce cortisol results within few minutes and can replace tedious laboratory-based techniques. This technology will create personalized behavioral intervention to regulate cortisol levels and prevent stress-related health problems for at-risk clinical populations. The proposed cortisol sensing technology will provide solutions to hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and pharmaceutical industries, which increasingly rely on fast, sensitive, reproducible and fully automated technologies.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project aims to translate a sensor technology, developed under a previously funded NSF grant, into a low-cost, handheld sensing device to monitor the salivary cortisol levels in point-of-care (POC) monitoring. The FIU team has engineered recognition site of cortisol sensor using antibody- mimic, robust and easily industrially scalable electroactive imprinted polymers that allow to miniaturize device in easily deployable and portable format. In order to translate the sensor into the market, the project will be consolidated into two goals: (i) sensor stability and measurement repeatability, and (ii) reducing cost and size. To accomplish these goals FIU team will 1) develop of high-affinity and reagent-less MIP sensor for Cortisol using novel electroactive monomers and 2) Constructing a low-cost handheld/portable prototype for field use. The proposed cortisol sensor will be capable of sending real-time data from the sensor to the virtual server via a smartphone app. The real-time data will be populated and processed on the virtual machines and will be archived by the user on their personal computer or smartphone app. The project will fortify a cross-university collaboration between the areas of health science and engineering; resulting in interdisciplinary biomedical research training for students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat. The proposed design will take a substantial step forward from the first and only demonstration of satellite-to-ground QKD (Micius, 2017), which relied on technology that is too massive, expensive, and low-throughput for commercial use. Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems.

As a nation, we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial acceptance in schools throughout the US. <br/><br/>This project is designed to provide simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade, using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions, both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting higher math applications and scientific discovery."

Composite materials are vital to the health and competitiveness of several important economic sectors, including automotive, manufacturing, energy, and aerospace. As composites have different compositions and element concentration/orientation and tolerances that vary widely, current CJAR practices are highly specialized, labor-intensive, and require experienced technicians to complete the work successfully and reliably. Partner institutions Oakland University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the University of Tennessee-Knoxville will work collaboratively with both the civilian and defense industries, in the automotive, aerospace, and energy sectors of the US economy.  The Oakland University D-CJAR will primarily work with firms in the automotive (GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, BMW, General Dynamics Land Systems), manufacturing (John Deere), and civil aircraft engine (Pratt & Whitney) industries, and also with the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Faculty and student teams at the partner universities will work with industry members to develop and disseminate basic and applied precompetitive research on methodologies, technologies, tools, and workforce innovations to facilitate rapid, reliable, and cost-effective composite joining and repair, with an overall goal of reducing costs, cycle time, and variation of CJAR operations within 10 years.<br/><br/>The scope of work for the Oakland University D-CJAR center will include components of automotive, aircraft, infrastructure (wind turbine blades, etc.) and protective equipment that are wholly or partially made with composite materials, with the goal of transforming the current labor-intensive and specialized processes into science-based, automated, digital CJAR processes. We expect advances in several fields and knowledge domains around CJAR, including (1) design and analysis, (2) materials and process engineering, (3) testing and NDE, and (4) data analytics. We will apply diverse advanced digital techniques, including advanced computational modeling, sensing, materials characterization, and machine learning to practical CJAR cases that will also advance the education and workforce preparedness of students working on projects at the partner universities.

For example, stormwater can diminish water quality by discharging pollutants like metals and nutrients as it runs over land and into the streams. Stormwater causes stream erosion, sedimentation, flooding and overflows in combined sewer systems. To combat these issues, municipalities must adopt innovative technologies, such as Green Infrastructure (GI) systems like bioretention, constructed wetlands, and vegetated roofs. Despite the advantages of GI systems, its adoption has been slow due to technological and human factors. These systems are not yet dynamic, cannot adapt to seasonal changes and are often able to accomplish only one performance goal resulting in high implementation and maintenance costs. Other potential factors include operation and maintenance issues, policy and financing issues, lack of buy-in from different stakeholders, and unclear return on investment. This research will develop ""smart"" (i.e., efficient, active and self-learning) stormwater service systems. ""Smart"" systems use sensor- and human-generated data to streamline GI maintenance programs to be less costly and more effective in performance, prediction and failure prevention. The broader impacts of the research activities are the improvement of stormwater management across treatment scales. The research activities will lead to more efficient and economical GI that demonstrates its need and benefit to society and all watershed stakeholders by making major progress towards flood mitigation and water quality improvement in impaired waterbodies. The underlying technologies allow for unique opportunities to directly connect infrastructure to stakeholders, system data is transmitted, stored, and processed in cloud-based data management systems and published as web services. <br/><br/>This project enlists a research-based approach that integrates application with the socio-technical system. This outcome will be achieved by optimally using all physical processes in a GI system (i.e., detention, infiltration, evapotranspiration), which uses sensors and controls integrated with real-time weather and system conditions, forecast data, and social media. Villanova University GI systems (green roof, constructed stormwater wetland, bioretention rain garden) will be equipped with sensors (e.g., soil moisture, water level, temperature and dissolved oxygen), as well as automated control structures (e.g., valves or gates), providing dynamic control algorithms that optimally operate during and after rain events. This GI system will be dynamically linked to a platform technology with real time visualization, data accessibility, quality assurance and real time control through physical computing. The entire automated system will operate at three time scales: 1) hours during, 2) days after the rain event, and 3) seasonal scale.  All control algorithms will be geared to maximize storage available for stormwater and water quality improvement. These goals will vary across season and climate zones. <br/><br/>The primary partners include Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Department of Computing Sciences from Villanova University (Villanova, PA); University of Pennsylvania School of Design (Philadelphia, PA); and Geosyntec Consultants, an industry partner (Boston, MA).

Due to scale, logistics, and lack of rural broadband internet access, there is a surprising lack of data in agriculture and agronomic research. At the same time, farmers and agronomists are in one way or another adapting to precision agriculture crop management and need high-resolution data at the landscape scale. This project will drastically reduce the time needed to generate accurate crop growth metrics from drone imagery, and then act on the information. Development of this project will improve data-driven decision-making in agriculture and agronomic research, including plant breeding and sustainable crop management. Data from our technology can be used for drone-based yield prediction for economic and value-chain applications, with information provided sooner than is available from current methods.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will reduce the cost and time to analyze unmanned aircraft system imagery of crop fields for quantification of metrics describing crop health, growth, and development, proactively during the season. The technology is software and workflows that use techniques from remote sensing, photogrammetry, and computer vision to automatically extract replicate images of research plots and management zones from raw drone imagery of crop fields, instead of relying on expensive and massive image ortho-mosaics and high-grade GPS measurements for plot extraction and analysis. The innovation can be applied in the field by eliminating the need for internet access or high-performance computers. The innovation also provides custom zoning of metrics, and quality control of the data generated. The innovation is an inexpensive method of high-throughput field phenotyping in the plant sciences. The innovation can contribute significantly to early-season yield prediction for a range of decision-making and forecasting applications. Implementation of regular consideration of growth analysis using inexpensive aerial imagery in the seed industry will improve genetic gain and product placement in precision agriculture management zones. Precision agriculture management will be facilitated by real-time, responsive, high-resolution assessments of crop health.

The key technology is based on the controlled release of chemo-drugs in response to tumor acidosis. The initial product is an acid-sensitive prodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a prominent chemo-drug commonly used in the treatment of breast, bladder, and other cancers (including the childhood cancers Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma). The current global annual market for Dox is ~$800M (~$400M in the US). Treatments of solid tumors that are likely to be acidic account for ~60-70% of Dox applications in the clinic. The Dox global market is projected to reach $1.38B by 2024. This pH-sensitive prodrug of Dox may be considered an improved version of Dox for treating acidic solid tumors. Also, this technology could be expanded to other chemo-drugs outside of the anthracycline class. Furthermore, acidic microenvironments are found not only in cancerous tumors, but also in other disease states, such as sites of inflammation and the ischemic myocardium during heart attacks, which represent other potential targets of the pH-sensitive prodrug technology in the future.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology for improving the safety profile of chemo-drugs by suppressing drug release at healthy tissues, while preferentially releasing drugs at tumor sites. The targeted drug release would be triggered by tumor acidosis. Due to rapid growth, many cancerous tumors have extracellular pH (pHe) in the range of 6.5-6.9, compared with pHe of 7.2-7.4 in healthy tissues. Tumor acidosis can be considered as a universal biomarker of the cancer microenvironment and correlates with poor prognosis (i.e., more acidic tumors are usually found in more aggressive cancers). To turn tumor acidosis against cancer, this team developed ultra-acid-sensitive, small molecule prodrugs to selectively release Dox in response to acidic tumor pHe. The critical challenge of developing an ultra-sensitive pH biosensor that can distinguish between pHe 7.4 and 6.7 has been met from the basic science side by using an acid-sensitive linker. Preliminary data indicate that these prodrugs can release ~ 4-fold more Dox at pH 6.7 vs. 7.4 in cell culture settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects 5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest, currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of 4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically for individuals with AD.

Interactions with bicycles are rare for a typical motorist, therefore safety-conscious drivers naturally focus on other motor vehicles in the roadway, and may not become aware of the presence of a bicycle until it is too late. In contrast, interactions with motor vehicles are commonplace for a bicyclist. Furthermore, the bicyclist faces far greater consequences in an accident than a motorist. Therefore it is appropriate for a collision prevention system to be the responsibility of the cyclist. Continuous display of bright flashing lights or loud sounds may suffice to bring attention to the cyclist, but they may unnecessarily distract nearby motorists, or they may alarm passing drivers, and cause them to move dangerously far from their own lane. The system under development will guide motorists to pass bicycles with exactly as much distance as safety requires. Furthermore, it will provide alerts only to those drivers that have a significant probability of collision with the bicycle. The system to be developed will incorporate a knowledge base of likely collision scenarios, thus minimizing false alarms. The system will provide guidance cues to the bicyclist, to ensure a safe and respectful response to motor vehicles. Human factors studies will be used to design an alert system that provides motorists with specific and effective audio-visual cues. These studies will also be used to ensure that cyclists do not respond to the enhanced security by becoming more reckless. It is expected that the technology developed in this project will enable motorists to interact with bicycles safely and with minimal intrusion. It will reduce the approximately 48,000 bicyclist injuries and 700 fatalities that occur every year. <br/><br/>The development of a bicycle-mounted collision avoidance system must address a number of challenges beyond those required for a similar system on a car. These challenges include the need to address more complex collision scenarios, the need to provide alerts to the drivers of other vehicles, the need for inexpensive, light and smaller sensors, and the need to rely on human users for effective functioning of the system. These challenges will be addressed by development of unique custom-designed sensors, novel estimation algorithms for vehicle tracking and use of a rigorous human factors study to determine which warning systems will be effective and how such warnings should be provided to the involved motorist and bicyclist in real-world traffic scenarios. The warning presentation is designed to minimize the trade-offs between low reaction time and unnecessarily intrusive disturbances to nearby motorists. The custom sensors developed in the project include a triad sonar transducer unit for side vehicles, and front and rear laser sensors on real-time controlled rotational laser platforms to track vehicles at continuously changing lateral and longitudinal distances. The human factors studies in the project will enhance our understanding of human behavior in multi-modal collision avoidance systems and analyze possible long-term changes in behavior after prolonged use of the system. The project also includes an intensive 6-month field operational test in collaboration with an industrial partner to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed technology. The field operational tests will involve 10 bicycles, bicyclist volunteers with significant daily urban commutes and extensive analysis of bicycle data recorded in real-world traffic conditions. Due to the close industrial collaboration, the research conducted in this project will accelerate the path to commercialization of this smart system with its potential benefits to the country. The project will educate two graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher, providing them experience in inter-disciplinary research as well as an opportunity for strong industrial interaction.<br/><br/>This project is a collaboration between The University of Minnesota (Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Human Factors Engineering/Psychology) and primary industrial partner Quality Bicycle Products (QBP), (Bloomington, Minnesota, Large business).

This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project seeks to enable a next generation residential energy market that will reduce consumers' costs, increase the flexibility of the electric grid to integrate renewable energy of all types and sizes  -- roof top solar to large scale wind farms -- while increasing the robustness of electricity delivery. This project will test whether adding rechargeable batteries (electric storage) to individual smart meters will turn these potential benefits into reality. This research leverages a new Energy Smart Community (ESC), comprised of 12,000 smart meters and a wireless data network in the Ithaca NY area deployed in response to New York State?s Reforming the Energy Vision strategy. The network of 12 thousand homes equipped with smart meters will become the test bed for this project. Researchers, working with the primary partners, will actively engage residential customers in the design of the smart service system and involve consumers in the testing and optimization of the virtual storage systems.  A smart service system will control when the battery charges (purchases electricity from the grid) and when it discharges (avoiding purchasing electricity from the grid) allowing the thus far unrealized savings for consumers, while creating potential new business opportunities and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting smart service system will be highly marketable and readily transferable to other communities and utilities throughout the United States and the world. This project is an integrated collaboration that is uncommon for universities. It engages a regulated utility, for-profit corporations, venture investors, residential community members and government agencies with a shared intent to bring solutions to the market at scale. This team will develop the smart service system infrastructure that will allow the retail energy market considered crucial to 21st century power distribution, to emerge. <br/><br/>A signature of this project is the use of computer models to simulate residential batteries, which may be either stand-alone or contained within an electric vehicle, allowing researchers to test situations where most residential homes have a battery without the cost or challenges of purchasing and installing them. A small number of homes will be outfitted with real batteries to ensure the computer models accurately capture how real batteries function. Five cross-disciplinary and cross-organizational tasks will leverage the team's skill sets: (1) Develop and test a unique experimental economics platform that will guide the design of market mechanisms that focus on customer-based distributed storage and generation capacity in electricity distribution systems, (2) Design, implement, and test a fully instrumented, control and communication capable, prototype smart service system at the individual residence level, (3) Develop virtual storage simulation modeling tools to integrate into the ESC advanced metering infrastructure (smart meters) to enable the efficient testing of different time-varying rate scenarios at low cost, (4) Design, implement, and analyze cross-disciplinary survey and focus group efforts to understand, engage, and collect feedback from the consumer, and (5) Carry out customer choice and consumer incentivization research.<br/><br/>The lead institution is Cornell University with its units the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, Civil & Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Communications, Natural Resources, Applied Economics and Management, and Information Science (academic non-profit).

Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months.  During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery.  There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain.  This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units.  Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period.  In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology.<br/><br/>The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions.  Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal.  Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage.  By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Phase I research resulted in a novel low-cost technique to fabricate encased cantilevers, thanks to the development of specialized semi-automated processing and quality control tools. The next technical objective of Phase II research is to further reduce fabrication costs by improving yields, increasing batch size, and implementing more manufacturing automation. We expect to demonstrate low-cost processing methods in which many high quality probes are fabricated efficiently.

Unfortunately, university counseling centers (UCCs), which are the primary access points for students to receive mental health services, are facing significant challenges in meeting the increasing demands. Specifically, clinicians at UCCs still rely on patients' inaccurate and biased self-reported symptoms for depression assessment. In addition, UCCs provide mental health services only during working hours in clinical settings. The lack of service access when needed could leave patients floundering helplessly and lead to lifelong consequences. Furthermore, with tight budgets, clinicians at UCCs have not grown and some UCCs even downsized. As a consequence, more students did not receive timely treatment. This project focuses on designing and developing iSee, a smart device based behavior monitoring and analytics platform. iSee harnesses smartphones/wristbands to extend the reach of mental health care far beyond clinical settings and to deliver timely therapies when needed. Furthermore, the continuously tracked depression symptoms allow UCCs to be more accurately informed with the severity of each patient and thus reduces unnecessary visits so that clinician time can be better utilized.  If successful, iSee has the potential to enhance mental health services in thousands of colleges and universities, benefiting millions of college students. Although focusing on depression of college students, the technology can be extended to other mental health conditions such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia; adapted to patients beyond college students; and deployed at other settings such as public hospitals and private clinics.<br/><br/>iSee consists of a smartphone/wristband sensing system running on the patient side to continuously and passively track patient's daily behaviors using onboard sensors; a behavior analytics engine using machine learning and causality analysis algorithms running on the cloud side to translate behavior sensor data into meaningful analysis results for identifying the patient's depression severity and revealing behavioral causes that lead to the mitigation or the deterioration of the patient's status; and a dashboard running on the clinician side to visualize behavior information as well as analysis results to help clinicians make clinical decisions and conduct treatment. The system would allow clinicians to access an objective, quantitative, and longitudinal record of patients' daily behavior to support evidence-based clinical assessment.

This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products, less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations). The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.  Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.  Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented. <br/><br/>The project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible, yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS, correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases. The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves the rationale for relevant engineering decisions.

The rise of e-commerce is rapidly changing the landscape of retail business.  By 2017, online sales will account for more than 10% of this $4.5 trillion industry, according to a 2014 U.S. Census Bureau report.  To stay competitive in this growing market, retailers are under enormous pressure to quickly deliver the goods to their consumers at low prices.  Large asset-based carriers (e.g., UPS and FedEx) are not particularly cost-efficient for express local deliveries in urban areas, essentially because their distribution networks are designed to transport through hubs rather than directly between customers and retailers.  This inherent inefficiency is aggravated by mounting demand for same-day delivery--widely considered the Holy Grail for e-commerce at present--that requires more frequent dispatch and in turn increases transportation cost.  Recent arrival of tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Uber in this battlefield attests to the tremendous opportunities and challenges in the urban delivery industry. Ironically, there exists a large volume of unused capacity in the transport system.  For one thing, because the urban delivery industry is highly fragmented, consolidating its capacity is often difficult. Another underutilized capacity exists in millions of private passenger vehicles on the road with empty trunks that could be used for delivery.  Addressing this lack of adequate coordination between demand and supply holds the key to solving the express urban delivery challenge.  A promising solution, enabled by recent advances in wireless communication and mobile computing, is crowd-sourcing technology that has been successfully applied in passenger transport (e.g., Uber and Lyft).  The overarching goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a CROwd-sourced Urban Delivery (CROUD) system.  With CROUD, consumers will enjoy faster, cheaper and more reliable delivery service. The retail industry will see a stronger consumer demand.  The delivery industry will improve its profitability and reduce its environmental impact, while employing a highly mobile and efficient workforce.  The project will also educate next generation entrepreneurs by providing training opportunities and materials for upgrading curricula in multiple disciplines.   <br/><br/>The scientific contributions of the project span across several disciplines, and they are closely interconnected in supporting a human-centered smart CROUD system.  First, the project will lead to pricing mechanisms that focus on matching consumers with couriers under varying market conditions.  The use of matching models is novel in pricing analysis for two-sided markets, such as thouse found in CROUD systems, and it promises insights in other markets.  Second, the project will help understand and predict behaviors and choices of humans in a CROUD system, a field completely new to behavioral econometrists.  New econometric models, calibrated with behavioral data collected in this project, will be built into management strategies to enhance the consumer-courier-technology interaction in the system.   Third, the proposed research will develop smartphone-based motion detection methods that are uniquely suited to track and interpret the activities of couriers.  Finally, the project will create computational tools to facilitate collaborative delivery among couriers and to optimize routing plans based on real-time information. In doing so, new formulations, algorithms and insights will be generated for challenging problems in operations research and computational economics such as network design with relays, real-time vehicle routing considering transfer and environmental impacts.<br/><br/>This project will be led by Northwestern University through its Transportation Center (NUTC), with three researchers from two departments: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Department of Managerial Economics and Decision Science.

The scope of the TAMU ? BOS Site (Site) will enable the Center to assess the entire solar industry, bringing value to all stake-holders from OEM equipment manufacturers, through systems integration, to end-customers and consumers. Because of this wide scope, the Site will be positioned to impact the industry through a scientifically-based, data driven research, design, and development process that is not currently available to individual BOS organizations. The TAMU Site will concentrate on research that assesses predictors of technology outcomes and global imprint of solar energy, along with solar costs, as indicated through technology teams, funding sources, collection technologies, as well as enhancing Center research on PV and additional conversion solar variables."

The proposed cell stimulation technology is expected to improve the efficiency of drug discovery, and lead to more promising drug candidates with a wide range of mechanisms of actions.  Since effects of drugs often depend on functional states of drug targets, in vitro high-throughput assays must be able to re-create different functional states during drug screening. Currently, screening assays acquire the data either from one functional state or an ensemble average of heterogeneous states, which is not representative of in vivo settings.  The proposed microplate-based cell stimulation technology will help drug discovery companies to introduce more efficient drugs faster while reducing the development costs, because the proposed technology can dynamically ""cycle"" ion channel drug targets through different functional states while evaluating drug effects in kinetic assays. These minimally-invasive all-optical assays will have increased information content and enhanced predictive values. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop nanotechnology-based optoelectronic microplates that can serve as a light-controlled actuator enabling dynamic optical stimulation of cells for all-optical drug screening assays.  Current cell stimulation technologies require either genetic modifications of cells (which can affect the drug screening results) or electric-field stimulation (which requires specialized instrumentation and can damage cells). The proposed technology is a non-invasive optical stimulation plate-based platform that can work on genetically and structurally intact cells, and will be compatible with existing screening instruments. The research plan in the material science area covers the development of protocols for deposition of graphene materials and comprehensive characterization of graphene-coated microplates in cell-free and cell-based modes. The biological research plan includes the development of all-optical screening assays that incorporate graphene-coated microplates for enabling optical stimulation.  Specifically, the goal is to focus on calcium imaging assays for L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels that will be ""cycled"" through different functional states by light illumination using optoelectronic plates. The validation process will include the evaluation of pharmacological effects of known state-dependent calcium channel blockers. It is anticipated that optoelectronic microplates will be compatible with existing cell culture protocols and imaging instrumentation."

This manufacturing service system will enable highly functioning relationships between a range of users, including service consumers (e.g., designers, entrepreneurs, makers) and service producers (e.g., manufacturers). Design organizations and new entrepreneurs have limited access to the advanced manufacturing processes needed for innovation due to longstanding barriers associated with: (1) cost and availability of advanced manufacturing platforms and (2) technical skill and experience needed to design manufacturable products in a correct-by-construction framework. While direct-to-print paradigms, such as 3D printing, have increased the capabilities for users to make parts directly from digital product designs, the capital equipment for manufacturing functional components are still housed in mostly private enterprise facilities. Additionally, challenges to accurately specify product manufacturing requirements remain as barriers toward facilitating large-scale, consumer-driven manufacturing services. Smart manufacturing service systems that address these persistent challenges will dramatically accelerate innovation across multiple industrial sectors by removing technological barriers for functional manufacture. The consumerization of manufacturing services will also enable manufacturers with excess production capacity to access a significantly broader customer base, facilitating stabilization of production capacity through decentralization of service demand. Democratization of access to manufacturing capabilities and the associated sharing economy benefits will lead to transformative advances in product realization for the US economy.<br/><br/>To facilitate these collaborations, this research project leverages prior discovery for rapid, digital process planning based on novel hybrid dynamic tree representations and graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated parallel computing. To implement this novel discovery in a distributed service system, the digital process planning method will provide product and process intelligence for each user class. Human subjects experiments and user requirements modeling will inform system design for user interface functionality, service consumer cognitive processing, service provider informational needs, and consumer-to-producer interaction requirements. The service system architecture will be designed to interface with users, facilitate user transactions, receive and shape input data, and enable archival functionality. To realize the foundational digital process planning discovery in a novel human-centered service system, new information models for manufacturing-related data and service provider production capabilities will be established. Advanced computational algorithms will also be derived for scaling GPU-accelerated process analyses in a many-user, cloud-based environment. Comprehensive system testing will inform efficacy of the underlying user requirement models, service system architecture, manufacturing information models and GPU-accelerated computing for generalized human-centered manufacturing service systems.<br/><br/>The research project assembles a collaborative team of experts in the fields of manufacturing, design, computing and psychology and a diverse range of industrial partners and nonprofit agencies to realize a next-generation manufacturing service system.

Hypertension during pregnancy can result in high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. This mobile-phone based system is important because if hypertension is detected early, mothers and babies have a greatly increased survival rate compared to what happens if this condition is detected at a later stage. The project is expected to result in a prototype of a low cost mHealth technology that can be used at point-of-care or at home. In the future, mHealth will transform the way diseases are diagnosed and treated, drive the healthcare revolution, and have the potential to significantly extend life expectancy. <br/><br/>However, there are several fundamental challenges facing mHealth systems that need to be addressed in this project through innovative scientific contributions. The proposed technology is expected to transform mobile healthcare through creation of mobile-platform independent, intelligent mobile sensing systems. A traditional approach requires efforts of several trained professionals to perform, process, and analyze the medical tests, and a qualified doctor to make the diagnosis and treatment decisions.  The common basis for this decision-making process is the professional experience of a single/several doctor(s). Because of recent advancements in mHealth technologies and Big Data management, it is now possible to access large-scale biomedical data about thousands of different patients and doctors efficiently.  This can be used to create an mHealth mobile-phone application to support and enhance the clinical decision making process. This approach can revolutionize patient diagnostics and treatment, decrease human error, and enable a variety of new biomedical instruments. However, it requires creation of a cross platform system compatible with different mobile hardware and software platforms. This work will address this challenge on multiple levels (ranging from hardware performance fluctuations within the same mobile device and platform, to cross-platform compatibility - e.g. Android and Apple iOS mobile operating systems). The project is expected to close important knowledge gaps about future mHealth systems and develop a fully functional prototype, compatible with different mobile hardware systems.<br/><br/>In addition, participating students will gain important technology and business experience, which will positively influence their education and prospective job opportunities. The business mentoring aspects will be covered by Dr. Michael Fountain, the founding director of the University of South Florida's Center for Entrepreneurship.

These errors can result in very high costs for businesses, including lost revenue from SLAs, lost customers and contracts, fines for violating regulations such as HIPAA, leaks of sensitive information, and decline in corporate image. To address this challenge, the company is building a system that automatically verifies security and correctness of computer networks in real-time, discovers vulnerabilities, and assists network operators in determining their cause. The technology functions by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network's behavior, and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically determine whether the network contains faults.

The field of tissue engineering regenerative medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and organs is at par with curing cancer. Almost every part of the human body has been considered for replacement. Tissue engineering strives to solve arthritis, Type I diabetes, stroke, vascular diseases, liver and kidney damages, and many other medical problems by replacing or restoring damaged tissues or organs with artificial functional tissues. This project will address the problem of poor oxygen transport in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure, by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment over the time of graft production and upon implantation and develop better artificial tissues. The oxygen imager uses cutting-edge radiofrequency and magnet technology and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. <br/><br/>The oxygen imager will be based on the innovative noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen imaging (EPROI) technology. EPROI uses an injectable water-soluble, non-toxic contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within 1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720 MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging. The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration, data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded biomaterials. It is expected that the oxygen imager will become an essential tool in tissue engineering labs of academic institutions and biotech companies and will have a major impact on the successful development of regenerative medicine therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Middle school is a crucial time in a student's educational journey as it is the period at which their self-concept of ability becomes stable. Studies show that it is also the period at which students start getting disengaged with math and there is a marked increase in negativity towards math from sixth to eighth grade. According to the National Report Card, only about a third of 8th graders in US public schools, of over 3.6 million students, score at the proficient or above level in Math every year. The goal of this proposal is to implement and test the effectiveness of a scaffolded learning and teaching environment, called the 'Teachpad', that helps middle school students learn difficult math concepts. Multiple studies have indicated that students put more effort into learning when they have to teach someone else. This project will extend these studies and evaluate whether the teachpad increases student engagement and improves learning and long term retention of difficult math concepts.<br/><br/>The proposed project uses a ""teach to learn"" framework in which students teach characters in a computer game how to solve specific problems and use the feedback that they receive from the characters to evaluate how well they have understood the concepts themselves. The teachpad uses natural language input, meaning that the students can enter their instruction in plain English and can explain the solution to the problem as they would to a friend or sibling. A semantic parser extracts the useful information from this input and feeds it to a machine learning algorithm to teach a game character how to solve the problem. A model of what the character has learned is also visible to the student who can see how their instruction is working when the character is trying to solve a test problem. This project will implement the teachpad for the order of operations, and will determine how it compares to traditional classroom practices. Data will be  collected in authentic educational environments, through observations and interviews to study student engagement and usability, and pretests and posttests (once after the treatment and once when students return from summer break) to evaluate learning outcomes and long term retention."

The proposed technology will be capable of evaluating EEGs in real-time in order to alert doctors when clinically relevant events such as seizures occur. This will improve patient outcomes by allowing doctors to intervene with medications in a timelier and more precise fashion.

In the first task, the existing seizure detection software, which currently works offline, will be converted to work in real-time with a target latency of 20 seconds to detect a seizure. This will be accomplished through intelligent memory handling and by developing a low-latency, highly optimized post-processing algorithm. The second task will strengthen the existing seizure detection code to operate at clinically acceptable levels of sensitivity and false alarm rates. This will be achieved by retraining our algorithms on a significantly more diverse and complex EEG database in order to expose the software to as many variations of seizure presentation as possible. In the third and final task, extensive software testing will be conducted in order to optimize the machine learning configuration that maximizes the gains achieved in Tasks 1 and 2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project provides unique technological advancements that circumvent traditional limits in speed of operation and in energy usage by taming the collective response of clouds of electrons in response to excitation - known as opto-plasmonic devices (OPD) - resulting in much more sensitive, high speed, and low power-consumption devices which convert optical signals to electrical ones, performing a crucial step in information transport.  This reduces the energy cost-per-bit of information, helping Photonics Integrated Circuit (PIC) technology to become mainstream for general public use in applications such as in affordable ultra-high-speed Internet, high-capacity Internet-of-Things (IoT), and energy-saving cloud data storage and processing. Notably, this project contributes to the technological leadership of the US in the multi-billion dollar global communications markets, by generating advanced technical know-how and intellectual property, holding the key in manufacturing of new OPDs. Successful completion of this project results in a business opportunity for several sustainable jobs for electrical and optical engineers with potential for exponential growth in line with increasing demand for data communication. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project produces market-ready high-speed photodetector technology based on Indium Phosphide material system that are i) capable of operation in tele/data communication rates of more than 200 Gbits/sec, which is six times faster than state-of-the-art, and ii) compatible with Silicon Photonics technology through a heterogeneous integration with silicon.

Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.<br/><br/>The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring."

Atmospherically-induced error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity, dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications for global monitoring, defense and agriculture. The value of data could make this a significant and growing market opportunity if the specifications are met successfully.        <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to correct aerosol-induced error in EOS data by reversing the effect, found empirically to be structured, independent of aerosol type and potentially predictable through measurement of dark target-reflectance ? water bodies clear of aquatic vegetation, entrained sediment and specular reflectance from windblown waves. The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated with dark targets. Once developed and proofed, the algorithm will be brought to the Landsat 8 Cal/Val team for validation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments.

Through a variety of interaction facilities, users can define areas in this layout that indicate parameter values of their interest. This then enables them to make informed decisions within a single visual interface and balance among the diverse impacts the various factors have on the decisions.

In short, this project will have a significant societal impact by allowing users to make better decisions in less time. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project makes several intellectual and scientific contributions. A core contribution is the ability to embed high dimensional points and factors into a 2D plane or map, such that the distance between points has contextual meaning. This allows a single visualization to convey what currently takes a dashboard of several bivariate plots to show. The inherent mechanisms that create the combined map-like layout of data and factors are novel and open new opportunities to understand multivariate data. The same is true for the interactions defined on the layout, in particular those that allow users to derive the areas of influence of the various factors. Another intellectual contribution is the interface that allows users to focus their attention on specific attributes and deals with the mental and cognitive overload that may arise in users in the presence of too many factors and attributes. The proposed system constructs a meaningful hierarchical representation of the attributes that can be navigated within a novel space efficient visual interface.

The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 set stricter manufacturing standards on sterile injectable compounded medications that have closed many third party suppliers, thus creating shortages and higher prices.  In response, the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists expects 40% of the US market, 2000 hospitals, by 2018 to receive insourced compounds.  Hospitals that insource hope to decrease their costs and improve patient safety with higher quality product.  Today, insourcing hospitals often have multiple information systems and use paper records cobbling together how a compound is made and to whom it has been administered.  When an ingredient recall occurs, hospitals spend hundreds of man-hours identifying the problem source and affected patients. To prevent further patient risks speed is demanded. This SBIR Phase I project will provide hospitals the capability of an end-to-end quality management that will track every production process step and tracing medications to patients.  Hospitals will be able to prevent patients from receiving recalled medications and identify quality production compromises thus improving patient outcomes and potentially saving lives.  <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is a novel medication barcoded label encryption technology compatible with existing hospital scanners to provide track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.  Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However, existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.  The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted data from the EHR and will be connected to production data.

Specifically, the project will demonstrate the feasibility of delivering a machine vision enabled inspection tool to relieve domain experts from labor-intensive visual examination activities. Various automatic picking approaches currently exist, with differing degrees of success. Nonetheless, the uncertainty involved in these tools is still too high for them to be widely adopted by the industry. Recent advances in the area of deep learning make it possible to surpass human-level visual recognition performance in some applications. High performance deep learning network models, however, require a large amount of high quality training data. In this project, the company proposes to use a novel self-taught deep transfer learning approach to overcome the data shortage problem resulting from proprietary rights associated with the data. The new training workflow is adaptive to the domain of seismic data processing. It will also minimize the training effort and deliver a robust system with guaranteed performance for new and unseen datasets."

Geo-specific data can also enable better land productivity measurement over textual block data.  Individualized, personally owned, data enables workers to have portability of information, building a resume of dependability and performance.  In addition, it becomes an integral component of a viable transparency scheme.  The project will potentially improve the economic standing of harvesters, improve the capability of farmers to better understand their workforce and land, assist marketers with improved data to insure against breakdowns in food safety, and enable consumers transparency without added steps to the system.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops improved data collection methods in high-value hand-picked specialty crops. The data in question is a precise record of who harvests what, where and when.  Contextual data (quality, irrigation/fertilization data, cultural practice maps, etc.) are added and visualized for farmers.  The project will test the relationship of data sets toward improved decision skills; better management depends on better measurement.  It provides a better understanding of inhomogeneities in space and time.  Addressing these inhomogeneities leading to investigation and reductions of variance.  The system will enables comprehension of bottlenecks and workflow problems in labor process and allow dynamic and real-time decisions.  The system will also allow quantitative approaches toward finding optimal decisions in several parts of the system and provide a platform for decentralized decision-making based on common data."

These generalized power sensors provided, for the very first time, a system potentially capable of wide area situational awareness for the grid. By developing algorithms that interrogate these existing sensor arrays, combining them with real-time predictions of GICs in the power grid determined from real-time geomagnetic field data that is input to information on 3-D ground (crust and mantle) electrical conductivity structure obtained from the NSF EarthScope Magnetotelluric Program, a ""Smart Service System"" will be developed that will be capable of predicting impact severity on individual power grid transformers.

The impedance, a frequency dependent tensor sensitive to the 3-D electrical conductivity structure of the Earth?s crust and mantle projects the ground magnetic fields into electric fields at that location. We will apply real-time streams of data from magnetic observatories to determine real-time magnetic fields at the sites of previously occupied EarthScope stations, and by projecting these through the impedance tensors and interpolating the predicted ground electric fields onto power transmission line paths, voltages that drive GICs in power grid transformers can be estimated in real-time and used as input to improved grid power flow simulations that will be developed under project support. This will be integrated with power flow information from mining synchrophasor sensor networks, and with satellite space weather data and NOAA geomagnetic activity forecasts. Human factors engineering will study power utility control room operator interactions with the data flow and user interface developed under project support, with iterative improvements of those interfaces made, given human factors feedback."

Orthoses are externally applied assistive devices that meet the personal needs of people with disabilities.  They are designed to achieve one or more of the following goals: control of biomechanical alignment, correction or accommodation of deformity, and/or protection and support of an injury.  Custom-made orthoses provide a better fit for users. They are more comfortable and facilitate more effective treatment.  However, the traditional plaster molding fabrication method for custom orthoses requires a long delivery time and multiple visits to the clinic, which are often physically, mentally, and/or financially difficult for users of orthoses and their caregivers. The service system is targeted for the One-Day Visit by facilitating the measurement, design, fabrication, and evaluation of foot orthoses and ankle-foot orthoses all within the same day of the patient's visit to the clinic.  The current custom orthoses design also lacks both the adaptability to adjust the stiffness for individual needs and the sensors to measure and record the motion data for clinicians and users.  This project plans on creating a cyber-physical service system aimed to fulfill these needs.  <br/><br/>The projected service system utilizes cloud-based design and 3D-printing, a rapid manufacturing technique for custom orthoses, to enable the One-Day Visit.  For this system, the clinician scans the foot and leg of the patient and uploads the geometrical and clinical prescription data to a cloud-based Cyber Design Center, which has the biomechanical models, baseline inertia measurement unit (IMU) sensor data, and a user-in-the-loop framework developed in this project to design the user-adaptive, sensor-embedded custom orthoses.  Advanced lightweight, energy-efficient motion sensors measure and record the orthosis motion in the living environment for a week.  While recharging the battery of the IMU data logger, the subject's motion data are uploaded to a cloud database and analyzed for evaluation of the gait and orthosis functions for the user.  This research connects three key aspects of the fused deposition modeling (FDM) for fabrication of custom orthoses: the measurement of defects using nano-computed tomography, prediction of plastic material properties based on the defect geometry, and FDM process optimization.  The ruled-based biomechanical decision-support model that can automatically design the shape of custom foot and ankle-foot orthoses based on user information and clinician prescription is studied for orthosis design practice. The development of a user-based optimization framework with long-term motion data of a user as the input will advance the scientific knowledge of user-in-the-loop design and control of assistive devices. This cyber-physical service system for custom orthoses presents a vision wherein the cloud-based design and 3D-printing technologies can harmonize with healthcare by providing a better service for assistive device users and their caregivers.  The efficacy of treatment and the quality-of-life of people with disabilities can be improved by having comfortable and adaptable orthoses delivered in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>The lead institution, University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan), is partnering with Stratasys (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) and Altair (Troy, Michigan) in this project.  The University of Michigan offers extensive research innovations in optimizing internal structures for 3D-printed porous structure, novel passive dynamic orthosis design, using motion sensors for gait analysis, and user-in-the-loop design and control.  Stratasys, a pioneer and leader in FDM machines and materials, will partner to provide the state-of-the-art FDM technology.  Altair has cloud-based product design center expertise, which includes all the associated software, hardware, and security infrastructure.

The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.<br/><br/><br/>This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents.

Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress.

Congestion costs the commercial trucking industry $9.2 billion annually, and incidents have been shown to increase the risk of secondary crashes by 2.8 percent with every minute of congestion. To address these economic and safety issues, traffic incident management (TIM) centers, typically operated by state departments of transportation (DOT), monitor roadways for traffic incidents, coordinate incident response, and provide traffic management and control to minimize the impacts of traffic incidents. This research will develop a new TIM system, called TIMELI (Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations), that has greatly enhanced capabilities for incident risk assessment and response over current products. Software-based intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that are currently available are limited to very basic controls and do not provide comprehensive or dynamic decision support. These systems display streams of traffic data on a map and rely on technicians to input a control action. To address these limitations, this smart system aims to be a more effective data-driven TIM that provides user-centric information visualization and improved analytics and machine learning. Use of the system by state DOTs can reduce the duration and impacts of incidents and improve the safety of motorists, crash victims, and emergency responders. Use will also reduce the TIM technician fatigue and reduce their turnover rates. <br/><br/>The goal and outcome of TIMELI is to use emerging large-scale data analytics to reduce the number of road incidents through proactive traffic control and to minimize the impact of individual incidents that do occur through early detection, response, and traffic management and control. This will be achieved using end-to-end machine learning for situational awareness, the design and rapid solution of geo-temporally aware traffic models using partial differential equations, stochastic model predictive control, and user-centric advanced visualization techniques for decision assistance. Current technology gaps in data handling and archiving, analysis for decision support, and the design of output formats will be addressed using big data technologies. Multiple large data streams will be ingested and data analytics will be performed for quality assurance and anomaly detection. New algorithmic approaches, machine learning, and a stochastic framework will be used to detect anomalous outliers and implement context-sensitive traffic models. An advanced human machine interface will provide information visualization and decisions recommendations in an intuitive format to minimize any cognitive bottlenecks. The objectives are to develop TIMELI and to integrate it into an existing TIM system. These will be accomplished by the following methods: (1) defining TIM user requirements and identifying bottlenecks in technician tasks using human factors research; (2) developing a prototype that includes a big-data-enabled back-end solution, an analytics engine, and a front-end interface; and (3) conducting testing, evaluation, and integration within Iowa DOT's existing TIM environment. TIMELI's multiple innovations will transform current TIM systems by creating a smart and reliable decision assist system used to monitor traffic conditions in real time, proactively control risk using advisory control, quickly detect traffic incidents, identify the location and potential cause of these incidents, suggest traffic control alternatives, and minimize cognitive bottlenecks for TIM operators. The test bed will be the Center for Transportation Research and Education's fully functional traffic operations lab that is connected to the Iowa DOT's data streams.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to education by involving undergraduate and graduate researchers in Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Human Factors Engineering, and will generate real-world data sets that will be used in developing educational material.<br/><br/>The partners in this project are Iowa State University (lead academic institutions), TransCore (a commercial provider of intelligent transportation systems, Des Moines, IA), and Iowa Department of Transportation-DOT (government agency, Ames, IA)."

The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups, a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently, 70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more than $1 trillion per year.

Such mass gathering events are growing in popularity, and thus require significant resources to ensure safety and success. To date, event management tools have not grown to meet this need.  This project is designed to address these gaps in event management tools.   The research proposed in this project significantly expands the development of a Data Visualization System focused on medical preparedness for mass gathering events, originally conceived for marathons. This system was created for event organizers and relevant stakeholders to effectively manage and oversee all participants, monitor the dynamic location of participants, and manage health and safety resources throughout the event, both under normal operating conditions and in the event that emergency issues arise.  The system provides a dynamic representation of the flow of people and resources: at the core is a novel simulation tool that predicts and displays runner density on the course over time.  The data visualization system is the first comprehensive dashboard for endurance event management.  The project will result in a significant ramp-up of the current prototype of the data visualization system to expand functionality and make the system more turn-key.  The project will also result in the development of a business plan for commercialization, working with Northwestern University's Innovations and New Ventures Office (INVO). While this system was initially developed for marathons, its applicability can go beyond endurance events.<br/><br/>This project addresses several important technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The innovation of the data visualization system comes from the integration of data visualization, participant and resource flow simulation, event data, and event management services. As such, the next steps towards commercialization will require advances in data analytics related to event data and operations research decision tools that leverage the data analysis.  System capabilities will be expanded in new directions to allow us to scale up the technology for broader applicability.  The project focuses in three areas: (1) upgrading the simulation model to capture additional flows of resources and participants; (2) merging new streams of event data to more fully capture the nuances of mass gathering events, and (3) developing new event management services that improve decision making for mass gathering events.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through INVO.  In particular, INVO offers a series of internship and fellowship programs for these students.<br/><br/>The project engages experts in event management and emergency response to guide commercialization aspects, specifically focusing on needed system functionalities in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

Data centers consume over 2% of the nation's electricity, generated mostly from fossil sources.  The Center for Energy-Smart Electronic systems (ES2) was established to develop tools and methodologies for improving the energy efficiency of electronic systems, primarily data centers. Much of the energy expended by data centers is wasted due to operating inefficiencies, including operating more servers than are needed to handle the workload and overcooling the IT equipment, or deploying sub-optimal cooling and IT technologies.  ES2?s research focusses on developing intelligent and fully automated techniques for operating data centers to match the IT and cooling resources to the workload demands, avoiding energy waste while maintaining service quality.  ES2 research benefits society by: (a) providing solutions to reduce the demand on the electrical grid and the carbon footprint and enabling the growth of data center-based services in an energy-efficient way and (b) developing human resources by training engineers and computer scientists in high-demand skills. ES2?s research therefore enables the nation to maintain competitive, agile and energy-efficient cyber services and infrastructures.<br/><br/>The goal of ES2 research is to develop systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self-sensing and regulating cognitive systems that are predictive and verified in real time. At the Villanova site, algorithms and systems are being developed to enhance and control cooling and to assist expert system schedulers being developed at our partner site to schedule or migrate workload in a holistic manner in order to achieve optimal energy consumption. Advanced strategies for cooling data centers using hybrid air-liquid cooling and single and two-phase liquid cooling are being developed and optimized.  These advanced cooling methods anticipate ever increasing thermal densities in data center equipment. Our research is leading to the development of improved methods and metrics for utilizing Dynamic Hybrid Cooling Systems which can be used to deliver efficient on-demand cooling where and when it is needed.  The Villanova site is investigating methods for the conversion of Waste Heat from electrical power consumed in a data center to useful Energy.  More than 90% of electrical power supplied to a data center is dissipated as waste heat, hence our research will have significant impact on the overall energy sustainability of data center systems."

Farmers are often at a disadvantage when it comes to capturing good prices from their crops because there are significant information asymmetries in the marketing supply chain.  We have developed a combination of hardware and analytics that greatly improves crop forecasts at dramatically more accessible prices, which allows farmers and their trusted buyers to make more informed marketing decisions.

In addition to the narrow application of sensing hardware and analytics for forecasting, the data collected by our platform can also be used by growers to make decisions that improve operational performance of complex agribusinesses and improve the agronomy of the farm. These tools make it easier to compare performance of crops to improve yields and reduce resource costs.  Together this technology continues to raise productivity and profitability per farmer.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project integrates a completely novel plant and weather sensing platform with analytics that synthesizes data into actionable forms that can drive agribusiness decisions.

These data are uniquely designed to monitor crop performance and its sensitivity to weather and management.   Data synthesis is a critical pain point in transforming raw numbers into insights for growers to act upon. By creating an integrated hardware platform, the data is poised to provide useful advice that allow a farmer to act on emerging situations, anticipate upcoming events, and even predict the future.  Our research objective here will be to generate probabilistic forecasts that use the unique data from our hardware to estimate key crop growth parameters and project forward for an operational yield forecast.

However, underwater channels are highly bandlimited and the data rates of existing modems are much smaller than what is needed for effective communication and management. The project will result in a prototype underwater modem that benefits from novel vector acoustic underwater communication concepts and methods.

In the new vector acoustic and particle velocity communication paradigm, the underwater modem designer is facing new communication channels and transducers that are fundamentally different from those used in the past. Therefore, proper designs for different parts of the modem, including transducers and analog and digital transceivers will be developed. Analog electronics are supposed to interface with multi-channel transducers, whereas digital signal processing units are required to generate and demodulate multiple data streams. The personnel involved in this project, graduate and undergraduate students, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through working at the interface of multiple disciplines such as electro-acoustic transducers, underwater acoustics, communication and signal processing hardware/software, as well as participating in an intensive boot-camp on technology entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The project engages Teledyne-Benthos and Kongsberg, two leading companies whose underwater modems and autonomous underwater vehicles are sold worldwide, to assist in at-sea testing of the prototype modem developed in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.

Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.<br/><br/>The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.<br/><br/>The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings."

Since buildings consume a large fraction of society's total energy usage, even modest improvements in building energy efficiency have the potential to yield significant benefits.  In recent years, utilities have deployed tens of millions of smart electric meters that record building energy usage over short intervals (e.g., every few minutes).  While the original purpose of smart meters was to support basic utility operations (e.g., automated meter reading), this project uses them as the foundation for developing a new class of smart energy service systems.  Specifically, the project focuses on analyzing the vast amount of data available from utility smart meters and other networked sensors to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and the electric grid.  The research is utility-driven, since utilities have i) access to massive amounts of customer energy data, ii) a way to deliver the results of analytics to customers, and iii) strong incentives to improve customer energy efficiency (e.g., by reducing peak demand to reduce their own operational costs).  The approach is scalable, since it leverages already available building smart meter data, rather than requiring the installation of new smart devices and control systems. <br/><br/>The project will develop utility-driven smart energy services to improve grid energy efficiency, encourage energy conservation, and promote the local renewable energy sources, such as rooftop solar. The research methodology includes developing new energy analytic techniques for smart meter data, combining these in novel ways to create specific applications that improve energy efficiency, packaging those applications as cloud-based web services that are accessible to end users, and evaluating their impact on user behavior and energy efficiency.  In particular, the project will develop three specific smart energy service systems:  i) iProgram to determine optimal thermostat schedules by analyzing smart meter data, ii) Green Demand Response (Green-DR) to opportunistically schedule elastic loads to align with renewable energy generation, and iii) PowerTrip to provide real-time energy event notifications and suggested conservation actions to users.  The project will implement a prototype of each system and evaluate them on real-world data (rendered anonymous) from 18,000 smart meters.  The research follows a human-in-the-loop model that integrates technical and user behavioral research in the design and implementation of smart energy services. Thus, the project includes user studies to assess each service's behavioral impact on users.<br/><br/>Broader impacts stem from the project's industrial partnerships with a local utility, a premier research lab (Microsoft Research), a small startup company (Budderfly), and an environmentally-conscious non-profit (WattTime.org).  These partnerships will expose students to industry perspectives on addressing real-world energy-efficiency problems, and interdisciplinary research that spans technical and behavioral disciplines.  The project will enable sustainability-aware curriculum, undergraduate REU projects, and sustainability-focused outreach efforts to local K-12 students through the newly established Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center.<br/><br/>The lead institution is the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  The primary industry partner is Holyoke Gas and Electric (HG&E)) (Holyoke, MA), a municipal utility.  Primary academic partners are the University of Maryland-Baltimore County (Baltimore, MD) and Williams College (Williamstown, MA).

By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today's cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women.

This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques.

This project advances and integrates the investigators' novel concepts of operations and core algorithms into an intelligent UAS Traffic Management system (UTM). This UTM system would also break market feasibility barriers for new UAS applications such as urban on-demand air transportation and UAS cargo delivery. Finally, the insights gained during the development of the proposed UTM could have profound impact on design and implementation of other human-centered smart service systems and cyber-physical systems that support civil aviation, e.g., air traffic infrastructures, operator ground support systems, communication, navigation and surveillance devices, and vehicle technologies. <br/>This research proposes an intelligent UTM system integrating big data architecture and computation power that will coordinate pre-departure UAS flight plans, detect potential collisions in real time, generate recommendations to resolve potential conflictions, proactively control any risk to people and objects on the ground during an emergency landing, and identify the cause of collisions. The aim of these capabilities is to minimize the number of collisions and mitigate the impact of each accident. This will be achieved using large-scale optimization, aircraft guidance and control, predictive modeling, system verification and validation, and advanced visualization techniques for information presentation and decision support. The proposed system has a pre-departure flight plan coordination module that queries the approved flight plan database and performs conformance checking for every newly requested flight plan to achieve conflict-free pre-departure traffic coordination. An en route traffic monitoring and alerting module receives real-time aircraft position data and active flight plans, performs automated prediction for potential collision, and generate recommendations to resolve collisions. An emergency landing and contingency management module queries multiple databases such as terrain maps, obstacle data, airspace data, public safety data and real-time aircraft position data to suggest emergency landing site and calculate the corresponding landing path to minimize the impact risk to people and objects on the ground. Finally, the advanced human machine interface will provide information visualization and decision support in an intuitive way to reduce cognitive inefficiencies and maximize human-in-the-loop performance to augment UAS traffic controller capabilities. The proposed system will serve as a complementary component of an ongoing NASA UTM.  The research plan has three phases: (Phase 1) Identification and synthesis of intelligent UTM user requirements, (Phase 2) Development of the intelligent UTM core algorithms and system prototype, and (Phase 3) intelligent UTM testing, evaluation, and integration.<br/>This academe-industry partnership is lead by a multidisciplinary academic research team: Iowa State University (lead institution), University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA),and University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI),) with primary industrial partners Rockwell Collins (Cedar Rapids, IA) and Mosaic ATM (small business, Leesburg, VA) together with broader context partners the Federal Aviation Administration William J. Hughes Technical Center (FAA Tech Center) (government agency, Egg Harbor Township, NJ). The partners will also receive feedback from the FAA Iowa office and Uber Elevate.

This project provides an end-to-end, user-oriented, cloud computing infrastructure that embraces the needs of all three critically involved stakeholders: users, model/tool providers, and computational resource providers. The cloud model has proved to be a cost effective, reliable solution to many information service challenges, and a cloud-based platform for scientific simulation and computation has the potential to impact the high-tech community by inducing a fundamental shift in the way scientific simulation and data are used. Small companies, especially emerging startups, need not invest in simulation software, but instead can utilize an extensive simulation ecosystem for product design. Companies with access to this platform will become less restricted by local computational resources, and more productive with a larger suite of simulation tools to solve design problems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a comprehensive infrastructure to host and execute scientific simulations and store and access the output data with ease. With multiple simulation codes available in one place, workflows can be created which use the output of one tool to provide input to the next. This modular approach enables users to combine different tools and customize the workflow to their own needs. Simulation outputs are all stored and the resulting scientific data can be mined for knowledge. User actions are also recorded and analyzed to enhance the user experience. Through customer discovery activities within I-Corps and continued requirements gathering from existing and potential communities, this cloud-based simulation platform will potentially change how researchers, students, educators, and industry practitioners engage with simulation and data on a day-to-day basis."

This project's technology, a wearable-app system, addresses this inefficiency by providing the means to inform and support women throughout menopause. The proposed I-Corps program explores commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of menopause symptom management and also investigates the potential of applications in the cancer symptom management and data sales markets.

The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service.

The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.

A majority of the data traffic remains within the datacenter. The number of hyperscale datacenters will double in five years. Each of these hyperscale datacenters houses hundreds of thousands of servers and consumes 100 MW of power. Such growth is not sustainable without fundamental changes in how datacenter is designed.

(1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them.

Sustainable forest management practices are important to decrease soil erosion, increase biodiversity, sequester carbon and meet future demand for timber and biomass supply to the pulp, paper, wood, and energy sectors. Reforestation (natural or assisted) of cleared or degraded land is an important management objective to achieve these goals. Management costs of private forest lands have increased over time particularly for small-scale private landowners. Unmanned aerial vehicles, equipped with customized hardware and software, have the ability to replace or supplement conventional assisted-reforestation practices (hand planting or mechanical) and provide a cost-effective alternative. This project's approach to reforestation can increase accessibility to physically remote or topographically constrained locations that are difficult to access with large heavy machinery and vehicles.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a data driven management system for assisted reforestation efforts. The system is designed to plant seeds using unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with customized hardware. The system hardware is capable of projecting customize seed pellets into a range of soil conditions and at penetration depths necessary for successful germination. Coupled to the system is a machine learning algorithm that provides data metrics on forest land holdings using remotely sensed images. The machine learning algorithm can be trained, based on data type and quantity, for more accurate and reliable analysis. These data enable private landowners to assess overall conditions of their holdings, facilitate development of reforestation plans, and determine flight patterns. In addition, the algortihm is capable of communicating and guiding the unmanned aerial vehicle's autonomous guidance system to direct field planting."

In particular, vocational safety training using the latest robot and other technologies is imperative, as thousands of workers lose their job or die on the job each year due to accidents, unforeseen injuries, and lack of appropriate assessment and training.  The objective of this Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project is to develop iWork, a smart robot-based vocational assessment and intervention system to assess the physical, cognitive and collaboration skills of an industry worker while he/she performs a manufacturing tasks in a simulated industry setting and collaborating with a robot to do the task. The aim is to transform traditional vocational training and rehabilitation practices to an evidence-based and personalized system that can be used to (re)train, retain, and prepare workers for robotic factories of the future. The need for personalized vocational training, rehabilitation and accurate job-matching is essential to ensuring a strong manufacturing sector, vital to America's economic development and ability to innovate. The iWork service is ""smart"" because it can adjust and adapt to the individual's abilities as it assesses him/her and help decide on the type of tasks needed to test and train, based on the job's complexity, difficulty or familiarity to the worker.  The iWork system integrates human expert knowledge to overcome or compensate for detected worker constraints. <br/>Research has shown that robot trainers can increase motivation and sustain interest, increase compliance and learning, and provide training for specific and individual needs. The iWork system aims to assess and train both the human and the work-assistive robot, as they collaborate on a manufacturing job.  The projected outcome is low-cost vocational training solutions that can have substantial economic and societal benefits to diverse economic sectors. Most importantly, if successful, projected outcomes could impact how millions of persons seeking a manufacturing job are trained, including those facing a type of learning, physical or aging disability. The system's mobile, low cost methods accelerate recognizing a worker's specific needs and improve the ability of the vocational expert to make correlations between cognitive and physical assessments, thus empowering traditional practices with user-centric targeted training methods. In addition, the project's robot-based emphasis on safety and risk assessment, can reduce liability costs and productivity setbacks faced by industry, due to manufacturing accidents. <br/>The iWork system uses computational methods in reinforcement (machine) learning, data mining, collaborative filtering and human robot interaction to collect and analyze multi-sensing worker data during a manufacturing human-robot collaboration simulation. Data collected and analyzed come from sensors, wearables, and explicit user feedback measuring worker movements, eye gazes, errors made, performance delays, human-robot interactions, physiological metrics, and others, depending on the task. The system has a closed loop architecture composed of four phases: assessment, recommendation, intervention (or adjustment), and evaluation, with a human expert in the loop. The system generates recommendations for personalized interventions to the expert, at different loop intervals. Use of the latest developments in sensing technologies, robotics and intelligent communications, assess the ability to enhance the intelligence of a robot co-worker with more human-like learning and collaboration abilities to support the human in achieving a task.  The system is modular and customizable to a particular manufacturing task, domain or worker robot. Two types of robots are used, socially assistive robots that provide non-contact user assistance through feedback and physically assistive robots that provide cognitive, physical and collaboration skill training. To predict risks of injury due to inattention, age, vision, or physical and mental issues, motion analysis and kinematics experiments are conducted to determine the type of safety training needed, to assess how well a human interacts with a collaborative robot, and how best to train the robot to help the human overcome identified physical and other deficiencies in performing a given task. The project integrates three main areas of expertise, engineered service system design, where assistive robots interact with and train each other to collaborate; computing, sensing, and information technologies, where machine learning, data mining and recommender algorithms are used to identify behavioral patterns of interest, and recommend targeted interventions; and human factors and cognitive engineering that deploy methods from the team's expertise in workplace assessment, personalized psychiatric intervention, and evaluation methods of vocational satisfaction, work habits, work quality, etc., as they relate to job preparation and retention.<br/>The project has an interdisciplinary team of experts from two collaborating universities, University of Texas Arlington (UTA) and Yale University, representing several fields, including human factors, psychology, computing, and industrial organization. The project deploys two primary industry partners, SoftBank Robotics (San Francisco, CA) manufacturer of humanoid service robots, and InteraXon (Canada), producing mobile EEG devices, who provides hardware, software and know-how to enhance iWork's functionality in cognitive activity monitoring. The broader context partners include, C8Sciences (USA), Assistive Technology Resources (USA), Barrett Technologies Inc. (USA), and the Dallas Veteran Affairs Research Corp. (USA)."

Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data."

One of the limiting factors is a modulator device that converts information from electrical to optical domain. This program will address this, and develop a fully integrated and packaged modulator prototype that will meet the societal needs for better connectivity. The target markets for the technology will be providers of computer and telecommunication network equipment, data- and computing-center owners, and network-service providers.

By drastically reducing the cost and knowledge hurdles associated with accurate submetering and bringing the costs of submetering in line with value, this technology opens the door for a mass-market approach to circuit-level energy use data. The market for this commercial submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies. Additionally, it is estimated that access to metering data alone can reduce energy consumption within a building between 5% and 15%, meaning a wide deployment of these technologies could have wide-reaching environmental and energy security benefits.  <br/><br/>The proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in true power metering by providing revenue quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting, as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit design, embedded software architecture and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested. Specific key technical objectives include creating a daisy-chain framework through which individual nodes within a metering system can share energy and data, improving accuracy in the myriad of potential field conditions, and creating a system of runtime-diagnostics to identify, and fix, human error in real time.

Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers and insurance companies. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments. The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology, proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks gestation.

Every year, millions of dollars are lost due to red tides and HABs throughout the US and the world. Losses can be direct, such as human illnesses and deaths from the consumption of contaminated food or the mortality of fish and shellfish resources, or indirect, such as the avoidance of all seafood products during red tides, even products that are safe. Management of areas threatened by HAB toxins currently involves monitoring programs that rely on weekly flesh-testing of shellfish collected from many locations along a coast.  These programs are expensive, slow, providing protection through conservative harvesting closure policies that have not changed for decades. Red tide management can be greatly improved through the use of technological advances such as the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), a submersible, self-contained ""laboratory-in-a-can"" that collects water samples and identifies molecules or genes that indicate the presence of hazardous species of algae. ESPs operate autonomously for months and transmit data, including environmental conditions, to shore. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate ESPnet, a system that will utilize these novel biosensors to provide environmental awareness and decision support capabilities for resource managers charged with protecting public health and the viability of fisheries industries and tourism from toxic HABs. This system is transformational, as it applies a new sensor technology to a major resource management problem that is currently addressed through monitoring programs that are expensive, slow, and outdated. No other service system of this type currently exists for managing HABs, microbial pathogens, or other water-borne diseases or problems.<br/><br/>ESPnet will be based on a network of ESPs that will supply real-time, high-frequency HAB surveillance information through a web portal complete with automated data analysis and visualization tools, allowing managers to view the coastal environment with unprecedented detail so they can act decisively and effectively. The three-year project will include field deployments of multiple ESPs at key locations along the Gulf of Maine (GOM) coast. The project team will work with their industry partner, McLane Research Laboratories, to modify ESP hardware and software to reduce power consumption and extend deployments to fully sample the HAB season in the GOM.  Meeting the overall goal of this project requires a development effort to fully automate ESP data analysis and to merge that with geospatially rendered environmental measurements; this system must be tailored to non-experts and available via a user-friendly data portal. Human factors will be addressed through identification of user groups and characterization of receptivities to the new system, optimization of the manner in which system information is supplied to users, characterization of feedback among user groups, and estimation of economic costs and benefits from the ESPnet technology. <br/><br/>This project addresses fundamental issues underlying management of the most widespread of all HAB poisoning syndromes--paralytic shellfish poisoning or PSP. Project activities thus have important societal benefits.  The ESPnet concept can be applied to PSP problems elsewhere in the U.S., as well as to other HAB poisoning syndromes, and to a host of non-HAB problems that affect water quality, such as viruses and microbial pathogens. This project therefore satisfies the criterion ""fostering connections between discoveries and their use in the service of society"".  This project has extensive undergraduate and graduate training, as multiple students and interns will be involved.

The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as ""QIIME.""  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact."

The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the sensitivity of pathogen detection. In the presence of pathogens, DNA amplification occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system. A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing both detection results and immediately logging the data.

Methane, the third largest energy source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power, weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural, waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor product line.

The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.<br/><br/>This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena.

The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced.

This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating.

It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process.

This low-cost, easy-to-use identification system has the advantages of improved accuracy, data management, and evidence preservation when compared to the leading competing presumptive chemical tests in this market space. It is also more cost effective than current field deployable instrumentation, which will facilitate wider adoption. <br/><br/>This project addresses technology gaps in utility, scope and user safety as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The team has very preliminary data on the identification of illicit substances.  Although these results are promising, this data set must be improved.  By working with crime labs and academic forensic labs with access to these substances, as well as ""street"" drugs, the team will improve the quality of the substance identification database to make it an effective tool.  Critical to producing a useable database is the ability to identify a wide range of substances.  The current drug-indicator works best for compounds with cyclic amines like cocaine, PCP, and fentanyl.  Relatively simple amines such as methamphetamine, MDMA, JWH-synthetic cannabinoids, LSD, and DMT require a different indicator.  There are several candidates and the team will assess them while improving their dataset for scheduled substances that contain cyclic amines.  <br/><br/>There is also the possibility of unwanted exposure to the substance under test. The ability to identify a wide range of substances does not, in itself, reduce the exposure risk. Currently users must handle the unknown by applying a small sample onto a test strip.

This places the project strategically at the vanguard of scientific discovery, in building a technology tool that will serve society?s goals. In the post-secondary education and training domains, market inefficiencies require excess spending on both sides of the transaction, adversely affecting both supply and demand. As the nation continues to deliberate the value of higher education in the face of $1.3 billion in student loan debt, streamlining the college application process by matching students and institutions based on an applicant?s career goals can reduce costs for students, their families, and institutions alike. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces where employer-employee matching algorithms will be used in recruiting, hiring, training, and team building, across the domains of health, innovation, national defense, and beyond. Ultimately, people analytics platforms have unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus generating tax revenue, creating jobs, and otherwise bolstering the economy. <br/> <br/>The proposed project focuses on the deployment of people analytics in the domain of college and career readiness and success. While talent evaluation through such innovative software is in its infancy, the small company's approach to college match will revolutionize how students identify their professional goals and then optimize their college experience for successful life launch. The small company's team of behavioral and data scientists, game designers, and software engineers, are creating video games that provide insights into a college applicant's career potential. Their platform captures massive amounts of micro-behavioral data -- how long players hesitate before making a move, persistence in the face of challenge or frustration, ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player's career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion, risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student's career objectives become clear, the company's proprietary recommendation engine suggests educational institutions and curricula best suited to attain the player?s career goals. In addition to expanding the game platform and collecting player data to develop and fine tune predictive algorithms, this project also will examine factors that influence a player's response to the insights and recommendations the platform provides. This work will investigate the impact of transparency, or ""scrutability"", of game-based assessments and implement visualization tools that promote the player's understanding of why specific recommendations are made."

Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.<br/><br/>The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements.

Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen >23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available.<br/><br/>The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 > 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria.<br/>"

More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. <br/><br/>This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop)."

Research shows that reading levels in early primary years can predict high school graduation rates. Effective Pre-K educational intervention programs are recognized as an effective return on investment (ROI) for society via improved employment opportunities, lower incarceration rates, and decreased need for social services. The scalability and ease-of-deployment of smart devices and other digital learning technologies has transformative potential to increase Kindergarten readiness outcomes that is widely accessible and affordable. Especially for children who cannot access quality pre-K education. However, modern digital early educational tools do not possess AI and machine learning algorithms for continuous assessment and modeling of children?s literacy and and oral language skills, nor are they capable of personalization to meet the diverse needs of individual children. The goal of this proposed research is to bridge this gap between the need for personalized interventions for early childhood learning with the ubiquity and affordability of mobile devices. The research team proposes to develop, deploy, and evaluate a system capable of automatic and continuous assessment, personalized content adaptation, and AI-powered educational mentorship to deliver high quality, scalable, and affordable early literacy interventions to young children.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research will develop a smart system for personalized early learning on mobile devices, by developing three innovative technology components: 1. Embedded student assessment algorithms, that can estimate reading skill from diverse, multimodal data sources including audio, facial expression, and real-time gameplay/usage data. 2. Personalized mentoring algorithms that adapt educational content to individual patterns of behavior of app usage to optimize for individual learning outcomes. 3. Affect-aware content adaptation and personalization algorithms to optimize engagement and learning. These technologies shall be embedded within two novel interactive educational apps. The first is for storytelling and vocabulary development. The second is for reading.  Both use general assessment data, real-time audio, and facial expression recognition to estimate performance and to optimize motivation, engagement, and learning. These technologies will be embedded within industry partner Curious Learning's mobile software platform, which currently delivers early learning software for children to promote early literacy readiness of US kindergarten children. The project will evaluate the ability of these technologies to assess reading skill, foster vocabulary and oral language, and to improve engagement and learning by personalizing the Curious Learning system's educational content to children.  "

A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data, and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach. However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader, expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics) to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote use in any environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the United States over 300,000 women are diagnosed and 40,000 women die from breast cancer every year. Breast cancer has a 99% survival rate if detected early, but limitations in cost, sensitivity, accessibility, and convenience of existing screening technologies result in one third of breasts cancers getting missed at early stages. Since treatment for early stage cancer is an order of magnitude less costly than treatment for stage 3 and 4 cancers, there is a clear economic and societal benefit for the development of better breast cancer monitoring and screening tools. To address this challenge, the technology proposed in this project leverages the proven benefits of ultrasound imaging and the newfound power of cloud-based artificial intelligence to provide a regular and accessible self-monitoring tool that can quantify and track suspicious changes in breast tissue. The device portability, low cost, 2 minute scan time, and automated analysis of breast image data will greatly increase the accessibility of breast cancer monitoring for women, which in turn stands to decrease the cost burden of this disease for the US healthcare system. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a new tool for early detection and monitoring of breast cancer: the Quantified Self Exam (QSE) that combines a low-cost, compact 3D ultrasound device and positioning accessory with artificial intelligence to empower women and their physicians with appropriate and actionable data.

The system architecture allows for simplified and low-cost ultrasound hardware that connects wirelessly to a smart phone/tablet and transfers captured data to secure cloud for advanced image processing and storage. The ultrasound scanner attaches to a positioning accessory for repeatable imaging that enables longitudinal 3D monitoring of abnormal growth using machine learning-based image analysis. The proposed Phase I R&D efforts focus on four objectives: (i) optimize electrical hardware and low-level imaging software for spatial resolution and image quality; (ii) build a QSE scanner that maximizes field of view and volumetric integrity; (iii) build a positioning accessory for positioning of the QSE scanner; (iv) demonstrate the longitudinal repeatability of QSE imaging by validating the alignment of 3D ultrasound volumes on a breast phantom."

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient's genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn's genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security.  This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata.  Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors."

Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with 10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection, power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. <br/><br/>The work of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption, low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone. In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product. The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

However, industrial fermentation plant failure data collected over a 15-year period suggests that 1 in 10 process cultures are subject to microbial contamination and associated production failure. Furthermore, while continuous bioreactor processes significantly improve productivity and reduce unit operation costs, most biotechnology industries shy away from them because of the inherent sensitivity to contamination.  Reduced bioreactor failure rate and operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-commodity chemicals such as biofuels, as production costs are a big impediment to large-scale manufacture; and their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. Our technology can increase the productivity and profit margin of these companies. With our technology, large-scale bio-commodity chemicals production could become economically feasible.

The system also contains an on/off switch that allows easy removal of the biocide as needed. Preliminary data demonstrates that heterologous expression of the biocide-resistant enzyme in Escherichia coli and subsequent directed evolution resulted in a biocide-resistant Escherichia coli with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 16 times higher than the negative controls.

As humans deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs, new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls. Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability, and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible for purely automated or manual robotic systems.

The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications.

In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period.

By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices.

This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.<br/><br/>The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface."

Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.  Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications. One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3 billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve first time IV access. <br/><br/>In phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access, and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming intra lumen placement.

Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%.

The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors.

With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics.  The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines.  In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform.  The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks.  In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment.  Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports.  The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring."

Compared with existing truck weighing systems, the technology promises to be inexpensive, easy to deploy, fast and very difficult to evade.  More consistent real-time identification of overweight trucks could significantly decrease the tens of billions of dollars per year of roadway damage caused by these overweight trucks.  An additional benefit of the system is that it promises to provide a new tool to identify changes in the deformation response of bridges.  These changes will help to diagnose structural damage to bridges. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project employs electro-optical technology to monitor the structural deformations of civil structures in real-time. The intent of this technology is to augment/replace existing systems that rely on load cells at weigh stations.  The technology measures the deformation of structures under dynamic loads with a passive camera system that can monitor the structure from a distance. The system uses off-the-shelf commercially available video cameras to monitor a specific target on a structure, such as a fastener, reflector, or structural feature. The real-time video is then processed using proprietary pixel manipulation algorithms to calculate sub-millimeter displacements and rotations in 3 axes. The information, when observed in real-time, as well as the data products generated from the archived data can be used to determine the performance of structures, the impacts of dynamic loading, and even the prediction of structural failures. The system can also be used to identify overweight trucks in order to enforce weight limits on roads and bridges. This system provides high bandwidth measurements while exposed to typical lighting condition dynamics or other ambient conditions. We have conducted real-world conditions tests on bridges and a building that validate the feasibility of the technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry has been implementing building information modeling (BIM) technology for years. However, current offerings restrict data exchange between platforms. This creates inefficient siloes during the building design and construction process that annually cost the capital facilities industry $15.8 billion. This project will provide the first commercial BIM system that puts interoperability at its core, helping to significantly mitigate these industry losses, using a new data-driven software development (DSD) technology. By applying this technology to building code compliance checking and construction automation, the health and welfare of the American public will be advanced through better quality and more efficiently built facilities. To help develop a more globally competitive American STEM workforce, the results of this project will be incorporated into existing undergraduate/graduate courses, and a 'Construction Ready' training program. Ultimately, this innovation will enhance the understanding and application of BIM technology to help the building and construction industry achieve improved efficiency and reduced time, cost, and human-induced errors. The R&D results will also transfer well to the infrastructure domain. <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop an interoperable BIM prototype system for automating building code compliance checking and modular construction analysis. This will bridge a critical gap in the AEC sector by connecting the currently-isolated BIM applications involved in the design and construction phases of an AEC project. This PFI project builds upon the DSD technology and the automated code compliance checking technology developed by the PIs. The DSD technology enables BIM interoperability by using invariant features of objects in BIM, which is radically different from existing approaches that rely on standardization or term-based semantics. It is the key to achieving seamless interoperability between different applications. The development of the prototype system will use an iterative method to constantly improve its performance. The planned prototype system will be tested in checking building designs with quantitative requirements of International Building Codes, and analyzing the design for modular construction automation. A 100% recall of missing information and noncompliance cases is sought after. New knowledge will be created about the implementation of the DSD technology so that it can be better utilized to develop other BIM-based applications and eventually lead to a comprehensive BIM solution with seamless interoperability between all applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finally, a tuning of the devised numerical processing schemes for high-speed embedded processing will take place.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their potential, existing wearable devices are only able to measure a few parameters (e.g., heart rate, breathing, temperature or blood pressure). In parallel to these efforts, nanotechnology is enabling the development of miniature sensors that can detect different types of human health events at the nanoscale with unprecedented accuracy. In-vivo nanosensing systems, which can operate inside the human body in real time, have been proposed as a way to provide faster and more accurate disease diagnosis over traditional technologies. Despite the potential of this technology, there are several limitations in the current systems, such as the cost and bulkiness of existing portable systems, which limit its real-world impact. The objective of this project is to develop a smart service system for advanced health monitoring and disease diagnosis based on wearable nano-biosensing networks. The system consists of three elements: 1) a nanoplasmonic biochip, to be implanted under the skin and designed to react to lung cancer biomarkers; 2) a wearable smart band, integrated by nanophotonic devices for excitation and measurement of the implant; and 3) a software platform to process the measured signals, extract the information, and formulate a diagnosis. This technology will significantly boost the applications of wearable devices, by providing the means to detect different types of diseases and, in particular, cancer. By partnering with two industry leaders and pioneers in the fields of solid-state electronics and advanced biomedical devices, this project is expected to enable cancer progression monitoring systems, with a broad societal impact. Importantly, integrating research and industry with education is a priority in this interdisciplinary effort, which will train the next generation of student scientists (6 doctoral students supported). <br/><br/>The project encompasses four intertwined research thrusts. The first thrust is focused on the development of the nanoplasmonic biosensing technology at the basis of this smart health system. This includes an implantable nanoplasmonic biochip composed of multiplexed sensor arrays for lung cancer detection from biomarkers in blood, as well as the optical nano-sources and nano-photodetectors needed to respectively excite and measure the biosensing signals through reflection, both integrated in a wearable device. The second thrust is focused on the development of the software algorithms to dynamically calibrate and operate the nano-sources, collect and post-process the measured signals at the nano-photodetectors by considering the intra-body wireless channel, extract the diagnose information and securely share the collected data with the healthcare provider. The third thrust is focused on the human factors that impact the design of the entire system, including the study of the impact and optimization of the nanoplasmonic biochip in biological tissues, the development of biochip regeneration techniques for continued operation of the implant, the investigation of the photothermal effects introduced by the nanophotonic excitation platform and the implant, and the processing and distribution of sensitive data related to the users' health. Finally, the fourth thrust will create an integrated testbed for the entire proposed system, involving in-vitro testing of the biochips with blood samples of lung cancer patients, ex-vivo testing with biochips implanted in tissue-equivalent phantoms with blood microcirculation networks, and testing in cadaver specimens.<br/><br/>The project is led by an interdisciplinary team of researchers at the University at Buffalo with participation of the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Chemical and Biomedical Engineering and Orthopedics. Two industry partners contribute and support the development of this project, Intel Labs (Hillsboro, Oregon, large business partner) and Garwood Medical Devices (Buffalo, NY, start-up partner).

Better biosensors lead to better health outcomes, and the prototype biosensor developed by this project aims to reveal molecular interactions that are presently hidden to all other types of biosensors currently in use.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project will achieve this goal using recent innovations in biosensing research.

The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.<br/><br/>The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies."

These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes."

This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing.

The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs."

The main goal of this project is two-fold: First is to demonstrate that bio-impedance sensor alone provides useful data to classify multiple insect species. A linear support vector machine classifier using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from bio-impedance data will be implemented on an embedded platform for detection and classification of two insect pest species. These bio-impedance based electronic traps will undergo large-scale field trials and be prepared for full commercialization. The second objective is to develop a multi-modal electronic trap with ultrasound, infrared and bio-impedance sensors that can simultaneously monitor four or more insect pest species. Measurement signals generated by the sensors will be analyzed to determine a set distinct features that can be computed on an embedded platform for real-time processing.

Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes.

One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017 NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues. Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution. This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health outcomes for all patients.  <br/><br/>A monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible, lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor, validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners. As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their progress in both training and competitive settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamic PET's distinction from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research and drug development. <br/><br/>The accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping distributions with different tracer dynamics.

The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints. The resulting system will be deployed to the company's users along with extensive evaluation of its efficacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This application is important because it allows the removal of carbon dioxide as it builds up in the air due to human respiration in enclosed spaces such as submarines, space cabins (International Space Station), and commercial airliners. The build-up of CO2 in these environments must be mitigated to avoid health issues such as cognitive impairment, drowsiness, increased heart rate, dizziness, and shortness of breath.  The principle innovation to be exploited in this work is the controlled and tunable synthesis of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs).  These porous materials have been found to act as efficient ""molecular sponges"", capable of ""soaking up"" toxic chemicals such as ammonia, formaldehyde, and other chemical agents.  The materials are also amenable to various chemical treatments such as acid/base washes and functionalization, which extends their applicability to a variety of target separations. <br/><br/>CDCs have the potential for high impact in the air purification and gas separations fields, but there are major knowledge gaps in scale-up of the materials and integration at the device level, which are both essential for commercializing these materials. The researchers in this project will develop the methods necessary to scale-up the synthesis of carbide-derived carbons to the 20-gram scale.  The procedures for producing CDCs beyond simple lab scale are currently unknown and are expected to have a significant impact on the use of CDCs in industry. Further, the project will focus on the development of a prototype test bed, where the performance of a proof-of-concept adsorption cycle can be demonstrated. Ultimately, the project will provide the synthesis means and performance data to create an adsorption unit capable of controlling CO2 concentrations in confined spaces to specified levels (< 1000ppm). The expected output of this work will fall into three major categories: (i) materials scale-up procedures; (ii) prototype/test bed design and construction; (iii) demonstration of CO2 removal performance under realistic conditions.  The personnel involved in this project, including a chemical engineering undergraduate student and postdoctoral fellow, will interface with project partners NASA Johnson Space Center and experts in entrepreneurship at VentureLab for training in customer discovery and business development methods.  This training will provide the student and postdoc with a unique experience that includes customer discovery practices and exposure to fast-paced research of a more applied nature. <br/><br/>The project engages NASA Johnson Space Center for testing of the prototype. Such device-level testing is too large for lab scale, but still too small to adapt for larger industry testing.  Thus, the NASA partners will provide a critical bridge across the performance gap to move this innovation from the lab to commercial scale.  They will provide realistic performance data by project end to support the continued development of the device from research discovery toward commercial reality."

The popularity of these mobile devices is due to a unique set of features including ubiquitous Internet access through communication technologies such as Wifi and 4G/LTE, easy to use touch-based inputs, and numerous applications and games. In the meantime, the security of mobile devices is becoming a major concern as device users are storing sensitive data such as personal contacts and utilizing sensitive applications like banking and stock trading. Strong authentication as the forefront defense mechanism can prevent unauthorized access to a mobile device that may lead to lack of accountability, data loss or stealing, and identity theft. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and their uses in government, business, and even military applications, securing mobile devices with secure, memorable, and usable authentication is of great societal importance.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on exploring the market potential for multi-dimensional authentication schemes. The new paradigm of multi-dimensional authentication schemes can achieve better memorability, security, and usability at the same time. The new schemes fuse information from multiple dimensions to form a password, allowing the schemes to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference. The information fusion can increase usability as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. The schemes can also be shoulder-surfing resistant. A successful authentication requires a user to respond to a random challenge so that a set of predefined rules are satisfied after adjustments made by the user. The schemes can also be used for continuously monitoring device user behavior to ensure the current device users is a user authorized to use the device.

Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills.<br/><br/>The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server.

Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.<br/><br/>During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field."

This is especially important in the aeronautics, automotive, medical, and space segments of the semiconductor industry because these products must achieve lifetimes well beyond those for which the technology used for their manufacturing was designed.  The reliability simulation software will lower the cost and time-to-market of high reliability semiconductor products by mitigating the risk of circuit failures of accelerated lifetime tests, which are performed immediately prior to releasing a product to market.  When a circuit fails accelerated lifetime tests, it must be re-designed and re-manufactured prior to release to the marketplace, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. <br/><br/>This project will result in a minimum viable product, which is software for a lifetime check for semiconductor circuits.  This semiconductor reliability simulation technology has the following unique features:  the software works at the system level, covers both front-of-line and back-of-line wearout mechanisms, and can incorporate customer-defined use scenarios.  These features provide a more complete solution to the wearout simulation problem when compared with the leading competing reliability simulation software in the market space (covering only device-level aging incorporated in device models).<br/><br/> This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The work incorporates three tasks, a comparison with standard industrial methodologies, calibration techniques for adjusting models to experimental data, and refinement of the simulation methodologies to enable scalability to large industrial designs.  Approaches include the use of accelerated tests for circuits, where test conditions are selected to isolate each wearout mechanism, so that failures due to a wide variety of wearout mechanisms can be observed, unlike industrial standard practice.  Scalability to large-scale designs will be demonstrated after development of methods to incorporate steps in the existing design flow and automation.  The goal is to demonstrate a reasonable computational cost and minimal impact on time-to-tapeout.  In addition, personnel involved in this project (Ph.D. students) will receive innovation/entrepreneurship/technology translation training through working with the project's business mentor, Jonathan Goldman.  <br/><br/> This project engages Aeroflex Corporation to demonstrate calibration of the experimental data to simulation results in this technology translation effort from research discovery towards commercial reality."

Current technologies are not poised to be able to meet the speed and stability needs of the projected growth in Internet data volumes and access speed requirements.  These are currently growing well beyond a Moore's Law pace.  Needed is a disruptive approach to optical switching that will allow data management to keep pace with market needs.

Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false. New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints. The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization methods."

The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers."

Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages."

The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions.  It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe.  It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex.  Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements.  <br/><br/>The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority scientists."

The lower dose required by the device permits screening or longitudinal monitoring of patients in various cases, such as brain injury, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, addition and other neurological and mental health disorders. The portable nature allows bedside imaging directly in patient rooms, as well as onsite imaging in military and athletic settings, including immediately after head injuries. The device's motion tolerance helps address hospital inefficiency and extra cost from rescanning patients due to movement artifacts, and the discomfort of remaining still, especially for elderly and injured patients. The low cost and small footprint compared to standard PET/CT systems, results in a device with utility beyond just large medical facilities, as it can be used in smaller rural clinics, sporting/military medical facilities, and in research studies of previously difficult to study brain functions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Project will help bring the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Helmet brain imager into use by clinics, sporting/ army medical centers, and research institutions. The instrument is a ring of detectors that can be placed around the head of a patient to non-invasively provide information of activity in different brain regions. This device requires only 10-25% of the typical clinical PET radiation dose due to the close proximity of the detectors to the patient's head, and published data show high efficiency and sensitivity of the detectors using industry standard testing. Moreover, the PET Helmet system can be transported to the desired location of imaging scanner, and a current research project involves testing the imager bedside for human patients with traumatic brain injury. The device moves with the head of the patient allowing for motion tolerance as well as upright imaging, and we have demonstrated appropriate task-related brain imaging during an upright walking task in human participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed technology uses the nano-<br/>Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by<br/>more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting<br/>in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,<br/>makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market.

With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a<br/>significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.<br/><br/>The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence<br/>signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-<br/>Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally<br/>efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional<br/>excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher<br/>compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive<br/>detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to<br/>achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less<br/>than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser<br/>sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to<br/>fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost.

For these ages, car crashes were the leading cause of unintentional injury death.  Despite recent improvements in car crash safety, these numbers demonstrate a need for continued research into the safety of children in car crashes and thus the continued need for the Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies (CCHiPS).  CChIPS primary focus is on motor vehicle crashes.  Each year in the United States, over 1,500,000 children are occupants in motor vehicle crashes with close to 1,200 children sustaining fatal injuries, while more than 169,000 children are non-fatally injured, leading to substantial loss of productivity in the young.  CChIPS advances child safety through pre-competitive research and translation of engineering, behavioral and epidemiologic research findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention. Injury prevention involves reducing exposure to energy to levels below human tolerance limits and managing the injuries should they occur. Adult solutions are not appropriate for children who are not small adults - biomechanically, developmentally, and behaviorally and solutions need to dramatically change to accommodate growth and development. The research conducted by CChIPS is published in leading scientific and engineering journals and conferences and the results are cited as transformative regarding knowledge of how children, youth and young adults are injured and how to best protect them.  <br/><br/>The Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies (CChIPS) is the nation's only IUCRC focused on child injury prevention, with a specific emphasis on injury due to car crashes.  The mission of CChIPS is to advance the safety of children, youth, and young adults by conducting research focused on their injuries and translating the findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention.  The technical focus of the Ohio State CCHiPS site will include special emphasis on two areas: (1) crash test dummy development (2) public education and outreach.  Crash test dummies are an important safety tool used by manufacturers to design and tests child restraint systems (CRS), thus it is critical to continue to improve the dummies.  The main focus of the OSU site will be to continue to assist in improving the ability of the dummy to predict occupant safety, which will help lead to the development of better CRS for our children and youth.  Unfortunately, the benefit from improved CRS might be lost according to research showing that up to 75% of the seats are improperly installed. The OSU CChIPS site began a public outreach and education initiative to translate research findings and to promote child passenger safety to parents and caregivers. This initiative, called ?Buckle Up With Brutus? provides proper car seat usage information through its website (http://www.buckleup.osu.edu), social media, and community events.  Further research will be focused on this outreach program with a goal of reducing the misuse of CRS by parents and care givers.  The CChIPS Site at OSU, housed within the Injury Biomechanics Research Center (IBRC), brings together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, anatomists, physicians, and computer modelers who focus on both mechanisms of injury and injury thresholds of the human body. Until recently, the biomechanics research community did not have a deep understanding of the injury mechanisms and response of children and young adults to violent impacts experienced during a car crash. Child and adolescent crash test dummies used to estimate the severity of injury in such populations assumed that children and young adults were smaller versions of adults, thus making it difficult to improve protection for children in automobile crashes."

This project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas, as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.<br/> <br/>The core technology to be developed further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives. This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn, helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.  After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant by the end of this project."

This<br/>limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger<br/>array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near<br/>optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.<br/>It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity."

Businesses today are enormously dependent on the archives of files, communication, and other information contained within the systems and services they rely on (networked drives, cloud storage, messaging tools, email, etc.). As these archives grow, they are increasingly hard to standardize and organize so that individuals know where to look for and how to find the information they need to do their jobs. The result is that individual employees waste enormous amounts of time trying to locate files and information fragmented across complex directories and many communication channels. Centralizing access to files and communication within an easily searchable and flexible workspace can unlock several hours of lost productivity and duplicate efforts per knowledge worker per week. Furthermore, presenting all of the relevant context around each file and message, including other file-versions, related files, discussions, activity events, etc., can help knowledge workers today with better version control, an understanding of how projects/ideas unfold, transferring of best practices, and preventing institutional knowledge-loss.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to further develop a novel method for users to contextually and unobtrusively access all relevant files and information associated with their work. This project focuses on developing software that can automatically map the relationships between digital workflow components (email messages, chat messages, tasks, contacts, files, etc.), and store them in discrete private databases controlled by the users. This project's key technical challenges include: improving the proprietary algorithms that automatically interconnect user information (while the information remains hosted on third party systems/services); improving the scalability of data ingress, processing, indexing, and syncing; and establishing a system capable of hosting and processing a multitude of discrete and disconnected databases of user information. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new type of software platform that can be hosted in private instances and that improves the productivity of its users by: consolidating user information stored on third-party systems/services; making it all easily searchable and manageable; and augmenting every file with additional history and context from all other connected third party systems/services.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nearly half of these issues are avoidable via proper management and training. In elite athletes, achieving the balance of over or undertraining remains difficult and elusive. Elite and professional athletes, and their coaches, sports scientists, and elite team trainers require the most precise assessment and management of training and performance and the cost of failure is much greater. With success in this population, this innovation can potentially be adaptable to fitness and wellness applications where precision is less important, and efficiency and motivation is more highly valued.

Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.<br/><br/>The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients. Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer. The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection.

Experimental investigations will be carried out to validate the methodology and to prove the feasibility of replacing device testing with material coupon testing to certify metamaterial pads for seismic isolation. This will include the investigation of processing methods to manufacture material assemblies with uniform mechanical properties, and will involve both static and dynamic testing of the material.

The Los Angeles Regional I-Corps Node will help accelerate this transformation, by helping to increase the potential for leveraging the region's products and services. The University of Southern California led Node, consisting of a partnership between the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles, and the California Institute of Technology, will improve the region's ecosystem by: modeling how to leverage regional strengths to support commercialization nationally; studying team and customer-network formation; aligning technology and organizational maturity paths; and determining institutional support mechanisms to accelerate team coalescence, technology-to-product transformation, and customer acquisition. The Node will contribute to the NSF's mission of empowering STEM students, technical professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to actively and effectively translate innovative ideas into large-scale commercialization. Annual I-Corps training sessions will be created that combine the strength of the partner institutions to offer new regional entrepreneurial opportunities and contribute novel resources to the I-Corps National Innovation Network (NIN). Two efforts will specifically focus on extending the Lean Start-up model to established industries in the Los Angeles region. The first will focus on health-care engineering, including a 'Mobile Demo Day' that will educate researchers on the convergence of engineering and medicine, regulatory hurdles, insurance strategies, medical industry distribution models, and related issues. The second will focus on aerospace and defense; offering unparalleled access to insight, mentoring, and opportunities to technologists in this area, along with strategies that can be used to develop an alignment with large-scale system integrators. <br/><br/>The Node will provide a vibrant research center for commercialization processes and outcomes. It will examine founding team formation, the coalescence of engineering talent with business skills, and customer and alliance development that cultivates relationships with industry incumbents. The research will also focus on evaluating and improving entrepreneurial skills in technology maturity assessments, understanding the level of technology maturity required for industrial adoption, and identifying institutional support mechanism for accelerating commercialization. The hypothesis that technology and organizational maturity proceed along independent and often unsynchronized timelines will be tested to better understand their interactions and identify factors that will increase success. Data from investors, customers, and advisors will help provide an awareness of each entrepreneur's stakeholder network and recognize correlations involved with both the activity and duration of fundraising.

This will enhance the capability of medical and non-destructive imaging technologies, for example, by allowing more accurate identification and diagnoses of tumor tissues in medical scans, or improving the identification of defects in manufactured parts. Combined with the benefits of ultrasound, in particular, safety, speed, portability, patient comfort, and cost, this technology has potential for broad impact. Commercially, the technology will enable medical practitioners to make diagnoses faster and with higher accuracy. This will allow earlier and more precise identification of tumors, reducing the number of false positives and follow-up procedures. This will ultimately increase diagnostic efficiency, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. In a non-destructive testing application, this technology will enable imaging detail that was previously only available with more expensive and time-consuming techniques such as X-Rays.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project combines techniques from the fields of ultrasonic imaging and the geosciences to significantly improve existing mm- to cm-scale imaging technologies. The technology adapts an advanced geophysical imaging method known as full waveform inversion (FWI) for medical and non-destructive testing purposes. Full waveform inversion is conventionally applied for imaging the earth?s structure and to discover oil and gas reservoirs. Instead of applying the technique at seismic scales (m to km), the company applies it at the ultrasonic scale (mm to cm) to generate high-resolution 3-dimensional images with embedded physical properties. Research is focused on both software and hardware development. Software algorithms are being developed which construct images from ultrasonic measurements within seconds to minutes. This is enabled through the use of cutting-edge, highly efficient algorithms and high-performance computing infrastructure. Research and development of prototype hardware is also being undertaken, necessary for generating high-quality ultrasonic data for input into the imaging algorithms. To-date, rapid, high-resolution 2- and 3-dimensional image construction using full waveform inversion techniques has been demonstrated on a range of ?synthetic? ultrasonic-scale objects. This demonstrates that images can be quickly generated, containing a full range of material properties including material density, stiffness and attenuation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Development of a differential sensor is expected to improve both the sensitivity and the precision of measurement. The reproducibility, accuracy, and stability of the measurement system will be critically evaluated using urine samples. Intra-assay and inter-assay variability will be experimentally determined by repeated measurements and statistical methods. Accuracy will be determined by comparison of the creatinine concentrations determined by HPLC (the gold standard) and the quartz resonator. Agreement between the two methods will be determined by Bland-Altman analysis.

Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current at-home care support for COPD patients is often completely missing or consists of action plans that fail to provide effective, individualized care. The alternative solution under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time. COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of COPD symptoms. Moreover, an easily accessible, highly accurate, convenient solution can empower patients to make better health decisions early. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists. The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations. As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness.

First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.

The goal of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Wind Hazard and Infrastructure Performance (WHIP) is to enhance the resiliency of buildings and infrastructure against hurricanes, tornadoes, and other windstorms. Findings generated from WHIP Center research and implemented by its industry partners will contribute to community resiliency against wind hazards while enhancing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. and the well-being of its citizens. Students will interact with industry partners, understand their needs, and obtain both academic and professional training. The WHIP Center will be promoted and grow in size and impact by attracting additional industry members and collaborating institutions. It is envisioned as a national center that will address multiple thrusts in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). The concept of disaster resiliency will be advanced among industries, government agencies, and the public at large through publications, and social media.<br/><br/>The WHIP Center will adopt a broad-based approach aimed at serving its members, who are concentrated in the insurance, risk modeling, and construction industries. Its major research themes are: a) wind hazards assessments; b) estimation of exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructures; and c) improvement of community resilience. Within these themes the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) will select the projects based on their priorities and the Center?s faculty specialties and expertise. Texas Tech University (TTU), as one of founding sites of the WHIP Center, has had an ongoing wind related research program for forty-eight years and supports a broad array of facilities including Ka-band mobile radars, 200m met tower, low-rise test building, wind tunnel, tornado simulator, and debris impact facility. The projects will leverage these facilities along with analytical models to build a strong linkage to fundamental research and technological innovation. Dual-Doppler radar and in-situ anemometry can measure and validate microscale surface winds in landfalling hurricanes. Fragility curves generated from tornado simulator could be quickly transitioned into design standards and building codes.

The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost. The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development, the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related optical applications that include microscopy, endoscopy, light machining, and display.<br/> <br/>Resonant beam scanners provide robust high-speed and high-performance operation that address size, weight, and power (SWAP) consumption limitations in state of the art light LIDAR distance sensors. The key outcome of the SBIR Phase I project was the successful integration of a resonant optomechanical element into an R-LIDAR distance sensor, demonstrating a 125 X 125 pixel field-of-view acquired at a 20 Hz frame rate. The SBIR Phase II project seeks to advance R-LIDAR instrumentation through (1) development of low-SWAP robust scanning elements, (2) techniques and instrumentation that allow for improved signal to noise ratio and high-rate data acquisition from pulsed time-of-flight LIDAR sensors, and (3) increased ranging capability of low-SWAP R-LIDAR instrumentation. Successful completion of these technical objectives will result in a distance sensing technology that will be particularly useful for high-accuracy surveying and inspection applications conducted using small unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), where size and payload constraints are acute."

The project will result in valuable proof-of-concept data demonstrating safety and efficacy of these cellulosic biomaterials in a small animal in vivo model and a large animal explant model. Successful completion will motivate further validation in a large animal preclinical injury model prior to clinical studies. The cellulosic materials are unique in that they are plant-derived, gel in situ via a dual coupling mechanism and allow for the incorporation of cells and growth factors for combination therapies.  These features provide the advantages of an extensive safety profile, cost effectiveness, minimally invasive delivery, enhanced stability and therapeutic versatility when compared to the leading competing materials under development in this market space.  <br/><br/>This project addresses several technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application of a novel material for IVD repair.  Current surgical treatment options (i.e., discectomy) are inadequate for long-term disease management, and existing commercial implants (i.e., total disc replacement) do not sufficiently restore disc structure and function. Replacing the gelatinous nucleus pulposus tissue of the IVD with an injectable material may help restore IVD mechanical functionality. Several products are under development for nucleus pulposus replacement, with none approved for use in the United States. This project focuses on the use of injectable cellulose-based hydrogels that form in situ in the intradiscal space to replace resected nucleus pulposus tissue. The proposed validation experiments will characterize an optimized cellulosic gel formulation previously shown to be stable and restore disc properties under axial compression.   The studies will determine the foreign body reaction in a small animal model as well as the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms under cyclic loading in bending using a large animal spine motion segment injury model.  Many of the competing products under development have been found to have poor biocompatibility or exhibited migration and reherniation.

For assessment purposes, this tool relies on a performance-based philosophy, which offers versatile capabilities to optimize the design in such a way that the cost is minimized, while the target performance objectives are achieved. On the other hand, for mitigation purposes, a decision-making algorithm is implemented to consider multiple strategies and identify the best solution based on a range of performance, cost, and risk metrics. This will be an important step forward to address the challenges that have prevented the building sector from ensuring the safety and comfort of buildings against wind loads.

Incautious alcohol use causes health and social problems that either manifest over time due to sustained drinking (e.g., heart disease, cancer, liver disease, diabetes, etc.), or are short term effects of acute intoxication and/or impaired decision-making (e.g., motor vehicle crashes, violence, etc.). Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths per year in the United States from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy approximately $224 billion. In light of the above social impact, the proposed graphene based wearable alcohol monitoring device addresses the urgent need to implement health approaches to reduce the loss of life and the huge economic costs that result from excessive drinking. In fact, the growing need for personalized health-care is highlighted by the estimated market size of $19 billion for wearable biosensors by 2018, pointing towards the potential commercial opportunity for self-monitoring alcohol sensors as well.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the unmet need for a small, light, unobtrusive, convenient-to-use alcohol sensor for real-time self-monitoring of alcohol consumption. Excessive alcohol consumption is a health risk behavior and the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Most strategies to improve safe drinking rely on obtaining accurate and timely information about alcohol consumption; these include self-report of number and timing of drinks, breathalyzers, blood analysis by lab, and wearable devices. Wearable alcohol monitors have clear advantages in terms of accuracy and feasibility compared to other methods for self-monitoring. However, current wearable devices for alcohol monitoring are bulky, inconvenient to use, obtrusive, and do not provide consistent, real-time data on the level of intoxication. In this Phase II SBIR project, a stand-alone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor integrated with calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver will be developed, tested and benchmarked on a large group of recruited adult volunteers.

Given the aging of U.S. populations, and the prevalence of dementia in elderly patients, patients with cognitive impairment will be an increasing management problem in healthcare systems. This project's information system will allow primary care providers to manage complex cognitively impaired cases without needing a referral to specialists, and without needing additional provider time with patients. Primary care providers generally manage simple cases of mild cognitive impairment, and refer more complex cases to neurologists, neuropsychologists, and geriatric specialists, which can cause economic and patient-care problems. Specialty care for cognitively impaired individuals can also be sparse outside of major metropolitan areas, which causes serious challenges to the equitable delivery of health care for rural and underserved communities. Primary care providers would potentially benefit with increased revenue and better care of the patients. Patients would potentially benefit from their care being managed by fewer physicians, and have more rapid access to diagnosis and treatment. Society will potentially benefit from lower population-health costs and improved healthcare outcomes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to develop an information system to manage patients with cognitive impairment by providing primary care providers with an integrated set of evidence-based screening, diagnostic, treatment and monitoring modules. These modules will include a diagnostic test for cognitive impairment based upon computer-analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data using a new technique based upon preliminary results. Because of its low cost, rapidity, and non-invasive nature, EEG has great promise as an office-based clinical test for brain diseases. However, to date, standard techniques of EEG analysis have not been accurate enough for routine clinical use. Similarly, currently, there are no tests that are FDA-approved for assessing cognitive impairments associated with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Another strong component of this envisioned information management system will be its recommendation of care plans personalized for each patient based on artificial intelligence-based models. In addition, the information management software will have the ability to connect the patient to other local services that are often needed by patients with dementia and other brain diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.  It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.  However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure, and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. <br/><br/>This project repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in translating medical devices into impactful commercial products.

Furthermore, many breast cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately, performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins. However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal post-lumpectomy RFA.

Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process.

The broader impacts also include expanding participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM and preparing students for entrepreneurship. Organs are scarce resources because of the gap between the organs needed and those available. Additionally, the short time span of the available organs in current organ preservation solutions limits the number of organs can be transported and transplanted into patients and which people can be considered for the organs further aggravating organ shortage and lowering organ transplantation success rates. The composition of the preservation solutions is crucial for the lifespan of the preserved organs. AFP-based systems have the potential to preserve cells, tissues, organs for a longer period outside the body and thus could provide valuable data and reduce the costs in various areas including organ/tissue transplantation, biomedical research and drug discovery. This project focuses on translating AFP-based systems for organ preservation.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project addresses the key technology and knowledge gaps as it translates from research discovery towards commercial application. Based on the characteristics of AFP-based systems including highly effectiveness, compatibility to existing solutions, and multifunction, AFP-based systems could be a potential advanced technology for cells, tissues, and organs preservation. However, significant technology and knowledge gaps hinder the technology translation. In this PFI project, a multidisciplinary team will validate the proposed technology and fill the knowledge gaps of highly active AFPs in the AFP-based systems towards the technology translation and commercialization. In particular, the potency of AFP-based systems in cold preservation will be systematically validated for pancreatic cells, tissues, and organs. Moreover, toxicity profiles of the key ingredients in AFP-based systems, that is highly active AFPs, will be established on representative mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, a scalable approach for preparing the potent AFPs will be developed. In addition, the students (esp. women and individuals from underrepresented groups) will receive training on innovation, entrepreneurship, and the process of research translation, technology development and commercialization as well as guidance for advancing the commercial potential of research through advising and participating innovation and entrepreneurship workshops/seminars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.<br/><br/>This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.

Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.<br/><br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment."

Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year.  Currently, hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually. There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized.  In addition, hydrogen has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx, used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability and lifetime meet commercial requirements<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional water-quality monitoring practices are based on ""grab-samples"" that are sent for laboratory analyses that may take days to weeks to be completed.  Similar traditional approaches are found in agriculture where excessive application of nitrate-based fertilizers may result in agricultural runoff that carries pollution to ground and surface water sources. The proposed high-performance, low-cost optical sensor technology will enable deployment of a dense real-time monitoring network in freshwater sources, water treatment facilities, and farms, and will gain a significant foothold in the $6.8B global water quality monitoring equipment market. In the event of natural disasters, integration of the proposed nitrate sensor will be useful in assessment of water quality in local water resources, providing communities with real-time information on water safety.<br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector for real-time monitoring of nitrate concentration in water. This effort will combine nitrate-selective ion-exchange membrane technology with today's low-cost infrared (IR) components for the design of a new type of sensor targeting applications in aqueous environment. The proposed technology relies on infrared optical fibers for signal transmission. Currently, the use of commercial real-time optical nitrate sensors, based on ultra-violet (UV) absorption, is limited due to the optical interferences in the UV spectra related to the inorganic and organic substances, and reduced UV transmission caused by turbidity. The proposed proprietary IR technology is designed to overcome these shortcomings through implementation of smart membrane filtering. The instrument will provide high frequency data collection in dynamic aqueous environments with a wide sensitivity range (1 to 100 ppm). This technology can be further expanded for measurement of additional nutrients and contaminants, making it a robust tool for water quality assessment."

Biomass utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin, of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States, decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. <br/><br/>The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining. This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

Society has an ever-expanding need for data, due to technologies such as mobile communications, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the shift of communication to higher frequencies (1s-10s of GHz).  As the frequency increases, traditional material choices, such as silicon, can experience very high losses and therefore there is increasing interest in using insulating materials, such as glass, to improve power efficiency.  Similarly, as device size is also important, ability to process thin materials is also critical.  Successful completion of this work will enable cost-effective processing of thin glass substrates and enable next generation communication initiatives impacting commercial, military and industrial markets.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposed to enable processing thin glass substrates in high volume environments.  There has been substantial interest in using glass for next generation RF and packaging solutions for many years due to its advantageous material properties, and scalability.  Of particular interest is the dielectric properties, which provide low electrical loss solutions relative to incumbent materials such as silicon.  Furthermore, the smoothness, hermetic properties and scalability of glass provides additional advantages over materials such as ceramics and organic laminates.  There has been a lot of progress in establishing processes to form thin glass and make precision through glass vias (TGV), as well as demonstrating advantaged functional performance in a lab environment.  There has been a challenge to establish the ability to scale to high volume for thin glass solutions due to gaps in the supply chain.  This SBIR project will establish a process that enables a carrier solution using a silicon carrier that will allow processing of glass in existing infrastructure making thin glass solutions available to the current well established and capable supply chain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pathologists examine slides from breast biopsies as part of breast cancer screening programs for more than a million women each year in the US.  This is a highly subjective process and there is evidence that even pathologists may disagree with one another, especially with difficult cases. This is potentially large patient safety issue, as some patients may not be optimally triaged.  It is currently possible to digitize the slides as whole slide images (WSIs), but there are very limited options for computer assisted pathologist review and this is a major reason that the digital pathology market has not developed as rapidly as most experts predicted. This project is a major advance as it addresses a large clinical need ? augmenting pathologists in their ability to make efficient and accurate diagnoses; and it also has great commercial potential as a disruptive, must-have application in the early digital pathology marketplace.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue of accuracy and efficiency of pathologist diagnosis in breast core biopsies, and this should validate our approach as an unmet need in the current digital pathology marketplace.

The project will ask pathologists to label WSIs with their diagnoses; this data will be used to train an AI system; and the AI system performance will be studied. Preliminary studies seem to support that a human and AI system working together will be both more efficient and more accurate than a human working alone. If this expanded project validates this, then there is a tremendous commercial opportunity that can also have a positive impact on patients.

The future electric power grid, commonly referred to as the smart grid, is expected to differ from the current system by the increased integration of distributed generation, demand response and sensing and communication technologies. As distributed energy resources become more prevalent and shape the future of the electric power grid, the overall operational flexibility of the grid increases.  This also means that more control decisions need to be made. This project provides an optimal coordination solution for coordinating geographically scattered energy resources. A commercially viable optimal coordination solution for ever increasing energy resources is crucial for cost efficient generation and dispatch of electricity and ensuring the reliability of the power grid. Specially, focusing on cold chain technologies, this project addresses scalable and flexible control and coordination of distributed refrigeration systems; it is envisioned that the proposed solution and software would turn end-users' pre-installed refrigerators and freezers into an integrated intelligent refrigeration system and significantly improve their energy efficiency.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project provides a novel distributed control method that addresses a significant operational challenge of the distribution electric grid. Control of energy systems today is largely performed by centralized computing and control solutions run at central units. Increased infeed measurements (sensing data) result in growing stress and extended time for computations. Thus, centralized control solutions may not be feasibly computed and applied in real-time. This project contributes to fundamentally new methodologies and software for distributed computation of control decisions in real-time. Our research provides a promising solution for the intelligent control of distributed energy resources, which enables the efficient interaction and coordination of a variety of components with and by a central unit. The key premise in this research is that if coordinated in an intelligent, predictive and scalable way, operation of numerous energy resources can be optimized in real-time, thereby resolving the issue of scalability. In addition to extending the proposed distributed control methodology toward achieving reliable and cost effective energy and demand side management, this project focuses on commercializing a more target specific extension of the proposed approach directed at minimizing the operational cost of refrigeration systems in cold chain industries through enhanced distributed coordination."

It is expected that this technology will also improve the quality of care in military ICUs. <br/><br/>The proposed project focuses on the development of a multi-modality agitation and sedation assessment system for patients in ICUs. The primary consequence of oversedation is the prolongation of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Prolonged ventilation is expensive and is associated with known risks, such as inadvertent extubation, laryngo-tracheal trauma, and, most significantly, ventilator-associated pneumonia. Alternatively, agitated patients can do physical harm to themselves by dislodging vital life support and monitoring devices with excessive musculoskeletal activity. <br/><br/>Undersedation and oversedation result in excessive economic burden on the healthcare system. The annual cost of oversedation in the US is $400 million, whereas reducing mechanical ventilation in oversedated patients by just one day can result in an annual savings of $4 billion in the US alone. Current clinical practice in patient critical care requires the nursing staff to assess the patient?s agitation and sedation state and provide sedatives to ameliorate the patient?s agitation. This process relies on subjective assessments and can be influenced by personal bias. This project proposes to use machine learning algorithms to integrate data from multiple sensing modalities to objectively identify cases of undersedation and oversedation in ICU patients."

However, with expenditures at 17.1% of the GDP, significant gaps in terms of access and quality exist, along with rates of morbidity and mortality that are substantially worse than other industrialized nations. The mission of CHOT is to advance the knowledge and practice of transformational strategies in evidenced-based healthcare management and clinical practice. The development of transformative approaches will necessitate involving partners from all sectors of healthcare including IT providers, systems solutions providers, care providers, insurers, and employers with large healthcare coverage programs. The realization that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to healthcare is unsustainable has motivated the modeling, development and deployment of personalized advanced wellness systems (PAWS). PAWS transcends traditional boundaries existing within healthcare systems, ranging from personalized patient care models (from a patient?s perspective), to personalized drug delivery systems (from a healthcare decision maker's perspective). CHOT is the only industry-university cooperative research center focused on innovations in healthcare delivery. The Center's interdisciplinary approach will deliver integrated and broadly applicable solutions and will enhance the education of the next generation of healthcare policy experts, physicians, nurses, and engineers. Undergraduate and graduate students become a part of a high-performing multidisciplinary organization that provides an ecosystem for networking, leadership, and career placement. It is expected that the work of the Center will result in improved health care quality and more effective use of financial and system resources in the health system, while providing immediate decision support to industry. <br/><br/>CHOT has identified four research areas in order to meet the needs of our members as well as the healthcare industry: macro-systems innovation; health quality, safety, access, and efficiency; patient-centered care and population health interventions; electronic health records and information exchange.

A concerted plan of seven research projects will be supported by research methods in systems engineering. In particular, systems thinking and system dynamics methods will be combined with simulation, data analytics, and machine learning in order to develop models that can inform the prospective assessment of interventions and innovations. In order to bridge gap between what is learned/discovered and what is done in practice/ management, knowledge-to-action (KTA) initiatives will be pursued, with a view toward technology readiness in order to increase the impact of these projects."

Positioning systems have revolutionized how we interact with the world around us.  Outdoor mobile devices make use of technologies like Global Positioning System (GPS) to deliver a wide variety of location-based services. Similarly, indoor positioning systems will enable delivery of new services that provide tremendous social and commercial value to humans in residential and commercial built environments. Indoor location services can be used by enterprises to track and manage assets. Building management systems can use indoor location information to enable services for building managers and occupants and first responders, such as effective emergency response, indoor navigation, and perimeter protection. Furthermore, indoor location services will enable implementation of important services such as coordination of people in a disaster scenario (e.g., natural or man-made (public shootings) disasters and navigation services for the blind). Unfortunately, satellite-based approaches, such as GPS, do not work indoors due to weak satellite signals that do not penetrate through building facades. Unlike existing methods, the proposed smart service will achieve high accuracy and robustness with respect to disruptions, while maintaining low installation and maintenance costs. In addition, users will be able to use their mobile device(s), (e.g., smartphone, tablets, smart watches), without the need to carry/wear additional equipment. <br/><br/>The project will develop and combine ultrasound, visible light and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)-based positioning techniques with Radio Frequency (RF)-based, magnetic signatures, human ambulation models and building information models (BIMs) for localization, tracking and visualization. The combined use of several independent positioning techniquse not only will dramatically increase the accuracy of positioning over any single technique, but it will add the necessary redundancy to withstand disruption of all but one positioning service, with provably bounded loss of performance. Even in the case of unavailability of all positioning techniques, ambulation models, together with BIM, will be able to provide indoor positioning at a coarser level of granularity. In turn, redundancy can be used to perform maintenance and periodic system calibration on any subsystem without service interruption. The impressive feature of the proposed methodology is that all these properties can be achieved at low installation and maintenance costs, as the system can piggyback on a building's existing audio, lighting, and RF communication capabilities. One unique property of the proposed positioning algorithm will be its modularity and extensibility. Information coming from different sensors will be incorporated seamlessly, allowing the algorithm to work under intermittent failure of one of its subcomponents. The inclusion of ambulation models, together with accelerometer, gyroscope and compass data available on the majority of today's smartphones, will allow the achievement of fine-grain tracking, which will provide smooth trajectories in place of sequence of locations. In the proposed scheme, Multi-sensor localization and BIM play a synergetic role. BIM will contribute to decreasing installation and maintenance costs, by providing precise positioning of the sources of ranging (e.g., light, ultrasound, Wi-Fi antennas) and accurate topological information to develop high fidelity ranging models. Additionally, the semantic information provided by BIM will help with detecting infeasible trajectories. On the other hand, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-based techniques can help refine BIMs and keep them updated. Dynamic information can enhance BIMs by providing useful information to building managers about traffic patterns and occupancy. Importantly, the design of the smart service needs to be human-centered and to take into account each of the stakeholders, i.e., owner and facilities management team, the service developers, the users of the smart service application program interface (API), who will develop value-added services customized for a particular facility or more generally for many facilities, and, of course, the end-users, the occupants and visitors of the facility, who will use the smart services themselves. To understand the needs and wants of such distinct groups of stakeholders, the project will directly involve them by conducting a series of focus groups. Participatory design is an established technique where a design team works directly with stakeholders to design an artifact or service. Stakeholders will also be engaged in the formal testing of the software service, from installation to maintenance, to application design and to application usage. <br/><br/>At the inception of the project, partners include the lead institution: Carnegie Mellon University, (Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute) Pittsburgh, PA, with primary partners:  Bosch RTC Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA, large business) and Sports and Exhibition Authority (Pittsburgh, PA, large business)."

Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.<br/><br/>The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing."

In the U.S alone, the transportation sector, which is dominated by internal combustion engines, accounts for about 28% of total energy consumption, 70% of the total petroleum consumption and 27% of the total greenhouse emissions. The key to higher energy efficiency and lower emissions for this sector lies in a better understanding of physical and chemical characteristics of combustion processes leading to the development of advanced engines as well as alternative fuels, especially from renewable sources. The controlled trajectory rapid compression and expansion machine (CT-RCEM) addresses this pressing need of the combustion community by offering significant improvements over the conventional rapid compression machines (RCM). The CT-RCEM has the potential to transform the RCM market and bring unique benefits to end users that include universities, government research laboratories, automotive industry and oil and gas industry. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project uses a precise motion controller with a high speed large force electrohydraulic actuator to mitigate the most fundamental limitation of the conventional RCM, an inherently rigid actuation system. The typical operation of an RCM involves, as the name suggests, rapid compression of air-fuel mixture by high speed motion of a piston in combustion chamber, leading to the ignition of the fuel. The associated data provides valuable insight into the combustion characteristics. However, the piston trajectory during this compression process is highly facility dependent and any changes in the operating parameters require hardware intervention and subsequent recalibration, leading to repeatability and reproducibility issues as well as a long turnaround time between experiments.

Potential commercial clients for the technology include 1) ophthalmologists and eye clinics, 2) medical centers, 3) customers living in rural or suburban areas with limited medical services, 4) senior living and retirement communities, 5) health insurance companies, and 6) ophthalmic instrument manufacturers. Eye diseases are usually detected in clinics with ophthalmic devices, e.g. optical coherence tomography, corneal topography and slit lamp, which are large, expensive and not portable, and need to be operated by trained technicians. However, our proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection method is small, affordable, portable, and it can be operated by patients in a convenient way, which will overcome the limitations mentioned above. The proposed algorithm can detect eye diseases or monitor eye healthiness in a proper and timely manner, and it can share the monitoring information with ophthalmologists. Hence, eye diseases can be detected in the earlier stage with our technology.  Moreover, ophthalmologist can focus more on severe treatments or surgeries. A 5- to 10-fold lower cost is an added potential benefit. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a new eye disease detection technology using a smartphone and make it broadly available for scientific discovery and medical applications. The project further develops a smartphone-based eye disease detection technology that is more accurate and convenient using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection technology makes use of panoramic images or short video recordings of the eye at different angles. The recorded eye images are divided into iris, lens, sclera, and cornea components using automatic image cropping techniques. Each divided component is then analyzed using shape detection and color matching techniques to recognize the shape and to detect the abnormality of each component, respectively. Preliminary finding shows that the proposed technology detects keratoconus with more than 90% accuracy from 30 subjects. To detect diverse types of eye diseases and to increase the accuracy of eye disease detection, we will collect additional eye data from patients and normal subjects to form a larger database, and apply machine learning techniques to the accumulated database. Bringing these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve discovery output in academia and industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range.

Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices.

The new process is an order of magnitude better in energy cost than current practices, and also emits well below half the carbon dioxide (CO2) of the most efficient existing metallurgical processes. The goal of the project is to generate the necessary process data to evaluate scalability and cost-effectiveness of this solid-oxide-membrane-based green electrolytic process for semiconductor and solar grade silicon production. Upon successful implementation, this process will demonstrate several advantages over current processes. They include: very low energy usage relative to free energy required for silicon dioxide (SiO2) reduction; use of inexpensive raw materials that require little to no pre-treatment; no carbothermic reduction, which emits 10 kg of CO2 per kg silicon (Si) product and whose contaminants typically reduce purity of silicon from 99.6% in natural quartzite to 97-98% in metallurgical grade (MG) Si; possibility of inherent boron removal by borium triflouride (BF3) volatilization; absence of any carbon or chlorine in the process; and there are no anode effects resulting in perfluro and/or perchloro carbon emissions. <br/><br/>Current methods for Si production include, fluidized bed reduction processes, carbothermic reduction of high-purity silica, slag/crystal refining, liquid Si electrorefining, and electrolysis of chlorides and fluorides. Some of the major limitations of these processes include extensive raw materials pre-processing, low yields, detrimental environmental impact and substantial energy requirements. In the proposed process, a one-end-closed oxygen-ion-conducting stabilized zirconia (SOM) tube will be used to separate pure silica (SiO2) dissolved in molten flux from an inert anode placed inside the SOM tube. To ensure product purity, a pre-reduction step using a secondary cathode at lower applied potentials will be employed to remove impurities that are more electronegative than Si. The impurity-laden secondary cathode will be removed, and then employing a liquid tin cathode the applied potential will be increased to reduce silica. The Si reduced will go into solution in the liquid tin cathode. Less electronegative impurity ions compared to Si will remain in the flux. Thus impurity oxides of both more and less electronegative impurities are not reduced along with silica. Si is over 95 atom% soluble in liquid tin at high temperatures but at lower temperatures pure Si and Sn are immiscible. This will allow directional solidification to be employed after electrolysis to produce high-purity Si ingots and demonstrate this as a cost-effective carbon-free method for mass production of Si from commercially available sources of silica. This project will provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to work with our industrial partners and move the technology closer towards commercialization. It will also provide a rich set of case-study materials for introduction into both undergraduate and graduate classroom teaching.<br/><br/>Infinium, a clean metals company, and SunEdison Semiconductors, consumer of semiconductor grade silicon will be engaged in the research program to assess quality, scalability and cost-effectiveness of the green technology for mass production of silicon starting from commercially available sources of silica."

The project will create a diagnostic tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener use of resources for society. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.

The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions. However, there still is no technology or research available to monitor and predict the shrinkage on-line during production to improve, to optimize and to control parts quality and processing parameters without using expensive instrumentation. The outcome of this Phase I project will fill this gap and develop a fully functional multivariate shrinkage sensor which will enable measurement of molded product dimensions in situ prior to ejection from the mold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand."

The threshold-logic circuits and the concomitant design methodology is important because, from a user's perspective, it will enable mobile systems such as laptops and smartphones to operate much longer between recharging of the batteries, and reduce their size and weight. It can also lead to reducing the energy usage of bigger systems such as desktop computers, and massive data centers.  From a manufacturer's perspective, it can result in cost savings, improved reliability and more competitive products.  The project will result in enhanced design tools, the design of threshold-logic primitive cells, and the design of a prototype circuit at least one advanced technology node to serve as a proof-of-concept of its robustness and scalability at lower geometries. <br/><br/>This threshold-logic based digital design technology has the following unique features: (1) a new architecture and method of operation of certain digital circuit primitives, and (2) a new way of incorporating them automatically in larger circuits using existing design tools, i.e., without disrupting the existing design methodologies, so that it can be easily adopted by industry.   These features provide the following advantages: smaller circuits, lower dynamic power consumption, lower standby power consumption, and lower variations in power, all without sacrificing speed, when compared to the leading competing digital ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) technology in this market space. <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery (successfully demonstrated at 65nm node) toward commercial application: the scalability of the technology and design methodology to advanced (smaller geometries- 40nm, 28nm) technology nodes, including overcoming physical design challenges, maintaining robustness to increased process variations, and scaling the accompanying software tools to industrial-scale circuits. These challenges will be addressed by first developing the circuit libraries in 40nm, which is still a key technology for many companies competing in the $1T IoT (internet of things) market, and then advancing to 28nm in FD-SOI.  The performance and capability of the design software will be enhanced by developing better interfaces to existing commercial design tools, and use of faster software libraries and commercial software platforms.   <br/><br/>In addition, personnel involved in this project, Ph.D. level graduate students, will continue to receive significant training that requires developing a broad range of design and analytical skills, in multiple technical areas, as well as learning how to meet exacting industrial design standards.

Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.<br/><br/>The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.<br/><br/>The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers."

The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The I-Corps customer discovery activities will also provide useful insights into other potential markets for this project's cooling technology, confirming if there is a need/interest by other industries, such as lasers, concentrated solar photovoltaics, and thermoelectric products, among many potential markets that use liquid-cooling systems at some level. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is motivated by a technology that consists of an embedded microfluidic cooling layer that offers significantly enhanced heat removal capabilities when compared with current thermal hardware -- this is as a result of eliminating the thermal interfaces and heat spreaders commonly used in microelectronic devices. The heat removal is directly managed by bonding the microfluidic cooling layer to the silicon chip surface through a metallic joint. The resulting micro-cooling layer replaces the need for the heat spreader used in current technologies since the microstructures embedded in the cooling layer have the appropriate feature sizes and layout with an appropriate flow distribution through engineered manifolds for effective heat dissipation. This technology provides the capability of unlocking the clock frequency on micro-processing units by allowing the input of higher voltages to the computing cores, while also keeping the device temperature below design limits. Laboratory experimentation with these microfluidic cooling layers under a wide variety of operating conditions and refrigerants has demonstrated capabilities for removing heat fluxes of up to 500 W/cm2; a 5x increase when compared with the current maximum heat fluxes of commercial, high-end central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While a vast majority of drone operators will likely follow the regulations and drones will be successfully monitored, non-cooperative drones or drones that have lost communication with their operators, will pose a significant threat to airport facilities where no intrusions should be allowed on the air field, critical infrastructure such as military bases or power reactors, and stadiums and arenas where drones can disrupt activities, endanger lives and cause economic losses.

Making effective recovery decisions addresses the different strategies of preparedness for energy systems and can drastically improve resulting economic and community impacts. This project will enable the efficient transmission of energy to island communities through a new technology, mobile energy storage transmission (MEST). The recent improvements of energy storage technology cost, size, and performance have resulted in technoeconomic feasibility of this innovative technology. Implementation of MEST will both improve long-term energy access for island communities and provide rapidly-deployable, flexible, affordable, and resilient electricity delivery systems for short-term crises. The advent of MEST coincides with the increasing importance of island energy systems; a market earmarked for high-growth over coming decades as sea levels rise, island nations continue to develop, and emphasis is put on development of sustainable energy systems.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on findings which identified a significant challenge in addressing the interdependency between infrastructure systems, in particular, pertaining to the role that energy systems play in the disaster recovery process of other infrastructures and communities. The proposed investigation addresses a missing link between resilience of infrastructure networks and multi-industry impacts to more effectively guide preparedness and recovery decisions. This project will evaluate scenario-specific applications of MEST for island communities; complementing the shortcomings of conventional cabled transmission. While on-shore cabled transmission is an efficient and low-cost mode of transporting electricity, subsea cabled transmission is costly and often results in poor redundancy of electricity supply. This novel transmission model, comprised of commercially available components, uses batteries and conventional freight transportation to move electricity from one market to another; providing service commensurate to a subsea cabled interconnector, but with added flexibility, resilience, and many benefits of traditional grid-level energy storage systems. MEST is founded on established economic theory, energy storage technology, and various market data.

This project will also enable the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students who are inclined towards the applied and commercial aspects of physics research. Contacts with suppliers of components for the infrared light source and with potential customers are further broad impacts of this project. This project has the potential to contribute to the economy of Virginia and the USA via the expected establishment of a start-up company that will create jobs, revenue, and intellectual property.<br/><br/>The proposed project will tackle the lack of commercially available light sources that are ultra-broadband and highly brilliant in the far- to near-infrared spectral range. The objective is to optimize the argon plasma light source prototype by increasing its lifetime of stable light output to hundreds of hours. The optimized product will improve data acquisition efficiency in spectroscopy applications especially in industry. The plan is to redesign this device improving on what has been learned from the previous iteration by optimizing the thermal properties, inner chamber design, and component replacement process allowing routine operation and maintenance to be simple, efficient, and reproducible. The characteristics of infrared radiation from a high temperature plasma in the frequency range between 100 cm-1 and 2500 cm-1 have not been studied in the past. This is because the quartz bulb in commercial xenon plasma lamps is opaque to infrared radiation in the above frequency range. The infrared emission characteristics of the proposed light source between 100 cm-1 and 2500 cm-1 and even higher frequencies will be measured using spectrometers and microscopes similar to the ones used extensively in industry, thus demonstrating the source's compatibility with existing spectroscopy equipment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs."

This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.

Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis.

If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool.<br/><br/>The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction.

In contrast to hearing aids that simply make sounds louder, a cochlear implant is surgically placed into the human ear and activates the hearing (auditory) nerve in a way that the brain perceives as sound. Presently, cochlear implants are used less than they can be in the United States, and even more children could benefit from the device. The reasons for the limited utilization include awareness and costs of the device, surgery and follow up care. The pursuit of this PFI project will offer a new way to make cochlear implants with microcoils.  Furthermore, by creating the devices in a way similar to printed electronics, dramatic cost reduction may be realized, along with the natural integration with conventional cochlear implant technologies. This project will also improve the awareness of cochlear implants through outreach and engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The proposed project pursues a novel method to develop microcoils that can fit within the human ear as part of a cochlear implant, the cochlear array. To produce this device, we plan to overcome technology transfer barriers through a novel manufacturing approach relying upon recent advances in additive manufacturing and flexible electronics to rapidly write (print) conductive traces on a polymeric substrate in three-dimension. We then encapsulate the device fully in a biocompatible polymer to realize proof-of-concept microcoils for bench and in-vitro testing. These devices will enable us to overcome the existing knowledge gap in microcoil dimensions, proximity to target auditory neurons, and stimulus parameters through bench and neural cell culture testing. The scientific merit is the demonstration that microcoils can elicit focused neural activity, via magnetically induced electric fields, and enable selective activation of auditory neurons. We will have the baseline data upon which to build our technical case for commercialization.

Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability in the United States with approximately 795,000 people suffering a stroke each year. Arm paresis is a primary cause of disability because of the limitations it creates in performing activities of daily living (ADL). Approximately 80% of all stroke survivors suffer from upper limb paresis and only 18% of these individuals gain full motor recovery with conventional treatments in the year following stroke. Thus, rehabilitation of the impaired limb is essential for improving ADLs and quality of life after stroke, yet only 31% of stroke survivors receive outpatient rehabilitation.

The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.<br/><br/>During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.

A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments."

In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.<br/><br/>This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently.

Since the 1950s, the gold standard of care has been to implant a tube, called a shunt, that drains excess fluid surrounding the brain elsewhere in the body where it can be safely absorbed.  While this treatment is effective, the shunts fail at high rates and most commonly because of clogging.  Because there are no clear patient symptoms and medical imaging technologies do not have sufficient resolution, patients live in fear that their headache may be an early sign of failure and must live close to a major medical center.  A major reason why shunt technology has not advanced in many decades is that there are no sensors that can determine when and why shunts fail.  In the near term, this innovation in miniaturized sensing technology will enable definitive diagnosis of shunt failure and in the long term, provide valuable data that can inform the design of failure-resistant shunts.  The potential societal impacts are reduced emergency room visits and improved quality of life for patients and family members.  The potential commercial impacts are new products for hydrocephalus and other medical conditions. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project will enable a major improvement in hydrocephalus care since the introduction of shunts in the 1950s.  Hydrocephalus patients suffer from an imbalance in the production of fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord and its absorption by the body.  A shunt implanted in the brain diverts fluid elsewhere in the body where it can be safely absorbed.  The portion of the shunt implanted in the brain clogs at high rates leading to vague patient symptoms at first but that become progressively worse.  A major obstacle is the inability to determine that a shunt is about to fail without surgery.  This can be solved by integrating wireless sensors into the shunt that warn of failure.  New advancements have enabled extremely small sensors that can monitor treatment directly in the shunt.  The goal of this project is to integrate different sensor types that provide complementary information in a smart shunt, develop a simulated benchtop model of a hydrocephalic patient, and demonstrate that the smart shunt can provide accurate information on the proper function or failure of the shunt.  The realistic benchtop model of the patient is critical to optimize sensors prior to future pre-clinical testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to accomplish this, the company is creating micro actuators and refreshing displays that will permit the blind to understand visual information quickly.  One major potential societal benefit will be directly related to visually impaired people and blind, who have a marked difficulty in learning geometry, algebra and calculus, and other visual disciplines.  Tactile Analogics? devices are intended to help them to understand such concepts by representing shapes/ forms in a fast-refreshing tactile way, helping to overcome that learning obstacle. Furthermore, the commercial success will be in producing and selling such devices (for different market sub-segments).  Tactile Analogics expects market adoption of 37% of USA blind students, 90% of blind educational centers, 40% of museums, and 7% of blind adults to use it in as a working tool. In collaboration with Sharp, Tactile Analogics will explore also a functional digital display with micro-valves embedded, the market will widen to give haptics experience to mobile users in a 2-sense data outputs via sight and tactile means. The company expects to generate revenues of over $200m after year five of production.  <br/> <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is attacking the problem that visually impaired people have to not just learn, but to understand images and visual information, with impacts on their quality of daily life.  Current cost of producing a single pinned printed page is about $20 USD per page and takes about 2 weeks to prepare and print.  Tactile Analogics? devices will offer a rapid fast-refreshing speed of up to 30 times per second, allowing the creation of frames according to the image that they are representing.  This solution will enable blind to not depend on pinned paper to understand images or shapes. In general, this is a haptic way to retrieve information and technically not limited to blind people.  The opportunity is related with providing a new type of information retrieval where sight is not needed.  The research objectives are to overcome design problems of our proven technology of micro-valves, where Tactile Analogics would be able to offer a standard tablet-size display for an area of 15cm by 20cm (2700 pneumatic valves).  Furthermore, the air chamber and the information conversion-actuator manipulation are two other problems to overcome.  The anticipated results are the allocation of not just the 2700 pneumatic micro-valves, but also even for larger displays.  Once the technology is proven, it will allow a variety of applications across multiple industries, with the possibility of creating many commercially successful product lines."

The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques.

Current and future health-care personnel, along with family caregivers, will be unable to treat or even monitor the wide-ranging challenges of the aging population from anxiety to loneliness, from dementia to physical disability.  This project develops Affordable Robotic Intelligence for Elderly Support (ARIES) as one element in meeting these challenges.  Technology will not, and should not, replace trained health-care professionals or close members of the family; but technology can lighten the burden on family members and the healthcare system.  ARIES will provide affordable assistance with small but challenging tasks of daily living, such as finding keys or reading glasses; remembering medication or appointments; connecting with friends and family; and relieving agitation and loneliness.  To be effective in these tasks, ARIES must be easily understandable and reliable, and the research team is developing innovative technological solutions to meet these goals. The most significant outcome of ARIES will be to facilitate and improve health care for older populations and enable more people to continue fulfilling lives in their own homes. <br/><br/>The project team harnesses novel research insights from the cognitive and behavioral sciences, geriatric psychiatry, computer science, and industrial design, as well as industry partner Hasbro's expertise in effective, affordable engineering.  The researchers will (a) use behavioral science methods to assess older adults' major challenges of daily living with which a small, affordable robotic system can assist; (b) apply inclusive design principles and cutting-edge computer science to develop a small animal-like robot that can alleviate these challenges; and (c) provide a systematic assessment of the developed system?s safety, efficacy, and acceptability in test beds with healthy adults as well as older people with cognitive impairments.  From a computer science perspective, this project will expand the frontiers of end-user programming and allow user and robot to engage in mutual teaching and learning.  The project is also poised to lead to engineering advances in object tracking and location technology and in the expansion of robot skills by levering smartphone capabilities. From a psychological perspective, the project will provide novel insights into human-robot interaction (especially when the user has no technical expertise) as well as advances in the optimal design of function and appearance in robotic technology for human benefits."

However, unlike the enormous progress made in manufacturing technologies in recent years in many industries, including semiconductor, electronics, automotive, food, chemicals, etc., the pharmaceutical industry has lagged much behind. The situation is such that, according to recent public comments and reports by the US Food and Drug Administration, there has not been much innovations in how pharmaceutical products are developed and manufactured even during the past half a century. As a consequence, the US is facing very high risk and cost of developing new drug products, high drug prices, many quality and regulatory issues, and, importantly, drug shortages. The lack of progress in pharmaceutical manufacturing sciences and technologies could primarily be due to highly complex nature of pharmaceutical products that consist of numerous different components, the inadequate understanding of material properties necessary at different steps of the manufacturing process, and non-availability of predictive tools to assess product performance based on material properties.

In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.<br/><br/>This project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Membrane-based separation/purification processes are becoming increasingly important in manufacturing such products. A membrane allows selective transport of one species from one phase on one side of the membrane to another phase on the other side of the membrane; often a membrane acting as a barrier selectively blocks one or more species from going through (e.g., membrane-based protective clothing against toxic gases). The species may be molecules in gaseous/liquid phase, ions in solution, macromolecules, nanoparticles, micron-size particles. Membrane devices and processes are favored due to lower energy consumption (e.g., desalination), easy scale-up (e.g., natural gas purification), smaller footprint (e.g., membrane contactors) and are the only viable option in kidney dialysis. The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) site of the Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Center (MAST Center) is focused on solving specific separation problems by developing advanced membranes and characterizing such membranes and processes. NJIT site provides advanced education, training and research opportunities to students and young researchers on research topics specified by MAST Sponsors: industrial corporations, national laboratories and federal agencies.<br/><br/>The MAST Center is a multi-university-based industry-university cooperative research center with three university sites. Guided by members of the industrial advisory board (IAB), MAST Center 1) conducts fundamental research in membranes via innovative materials and processes facilitating the use of membrane technology for current/emerging industrial applications; (2) sustains technological leadership in membrane materials and membrane-based separation processes and facilitates commercialization of innovative technologies; and (3) provides undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows with a relevant educational and research experience. The Center-spanning research themes aligned with IAB interests are: water treatment, bioseparations, membrane fabrication and characterization, organic solvent processing, gas separations, barrier membranes. NJIT's MAST Center faculty from four academic departments have their research focus on water treatment, barrier membranes, organic solvent-based system processing and membrane characterization. Research thrust areas of special interest to NJIT MAST faculty are: water treatment membranes for desalination, industrial effluent treatment and recovery of chemicals and metals by novel membranes, organic solvent-based system processing with solvent-resistant membranes, barrier membranes for chemical and biological protection. Research on advanced membrane materials and structures and their incorporation in novel separation devices/schemes are expected to respond to challenging separation and purification needs encountered by current and potential membrane users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These hybrid probes will enable the non-invasive delivery of ultra-violet and visible photons deep in tissue where the light could not otherwise penetrate, to mark targets for therapy or diagnostics. For example, this light may be used to trigger the uncaging of tumor drugs at local points of interest, excite fluorophores for imaging, initiate neural firing or cellular signal transduction cascades in genetically engineered species, etc.  The application of our materials will enable more advanced experiments, leading to better understanding of complex systems such as the brain, which will ultimately help treat and prevent brain disorders. In addition, since these particles perform photon upconversion at very low excitation densities, much cheaper non-coherent light sources such as red LEDs can replace the high power near-infrared lasers currently required today. This is ideal for point of care testing for personalized medicine and the battlefield where instant diagnosis and portability are essential.<br/> <br/>The I-Corps project is based on a molecular-nanocrystal hybrid that upconverts light via a multi-step energy transfer process. For the life science applications mentioned above, our label exhibits much higher sensitivity than existing commercial technologies by avoiding excitation at the optical window where biological species absorb, scatter, and autofluoresce. Different components of the system can be tuned to selectively produce high energy ultra-violet and visible photons from incoming low energy near-infrared photons. Synthetic control of both the nanocrystal light absorber and molecular transmitter and emitter have resulted in a high photon upconversion quantum yield.

Metamaterials are man-made or engineered materials having remarkable properties that do not occur in nature. The focus of the CfM is primarily on optical, infrared and radar applications of metamaterials and the new ways in which they permit to control the flow of light and sophisticated filtering and detection of light.  Examples include improved performance of light harvesting systems for energy production and designs for smaller higher performance antennas for broadband communications.  The CfM works closely with members to address fundamental and precompetitive questions regarding the design and fabrication of metamaterials with customized properties.  Fundamental questions include how radiation can be made to interact more strongly with the meta-atoms that compose the metamaterial.   It is these interactions that lead to new approaches for engineering designs for improved technologies ranging from imaging sensors to improved heat sinks. The projects conducted within the CfM are developed collaboratively with the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) deciding on the viability of metamaterials solutions for achieving smaller, better, lower-cost and higher performance products for both commercial and defense deployment.  The global metamaterials market sector is growing fast and through the CfM, members remain current and competitive on the many emerging technology opportunities.  In addition, all projects are conducted by a cohort of students on each site, several from under- represented groups in science. Students' projects typically fold into their dissertations and work closely with members as interns making them well-positioned for employment after graduation. <br/><br/>The CfM's faculty and students at UNCC and Clarkson to work hand-in-hand with IAB members to develop new knowledge, new materials' capabilities and software tools. The technology roadmap, developed by our members, provides a framework for the clustering of project objectives into more specific goals.  To ensure the long-term success and viability of the Center, we focus on research that impacts a broad range of industries. CfM goals are to better understand and exploit new properties associated with structured materials, publish and generate IP related to new components and devices.  Within the CfM there are many foundational scientific questions to be addressed, concerning understanding and modeling the physical processes that occur when waves interact with subwavelength sized structures.  Resonant behavior combined with effective medium descriptions can predict unusual material properties, such as negative refractive index.  Exploiting resonant behavior in subwavelength elements, surface patterns and composites, all demand more complete descriptions and a deeper understanding of field-matter interactions. At the nanoscale many new phenomena are being unveiled that are ripe for technological advances. The rich resources of the CfM are well suited to address the tiers of challenges associated with advancing metamaterial applications and filling technology gaps.  UNC Charlotte has an interdisciplinary team of faculty participating in the CfM.  It also has excellent optical, microwave and micro/nanofabrication facilities user facilities housed in its Center for Optoelectronics and Optical Communications to support CfM projects. CfM supported graduate students are drawn from several graduate programs including Optical Science and Engineering (OSE), EE, ME and Nanoscale Sciences (NS).  Moving forward, we plan to include medical and acoustic metamaterials while retaining a brand for the CfM primarily tied to sensing, imaging, antennas and energy harvesting."

To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction.

There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.<br/><br/><br/>This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers.

The issue of sustainability is and should be paramount in how we design, manufacture, use, and retire the many products consumed within the United States and throughout the world. Unlike solar or wind energy that can be cost effectively harnessed for a long time or agricultural products as a natural resource, inorganic materials, such as metals and minerals, are not renewable. Therefore, the need exists for the development of technologies to address materials recovery and recycling. Although considerable coordinated academic research is rightly underway to meet energy challenges, university efforts to build the basic science and technologies for materials sustainability are less extensive and fragmented despite the prospect for significant energy and environmental ramifications. Research supporting materials recovery and recyclability is inherently multidisciplinary and must respond to the needs of a multiplicity of commercial stakeholders from throughout the supply chain. CR3 brings together four leading universities with expertise in materials science and engineering. The industrial application of new advanced materials will require an increase in the efficiency of materials resource recovery and recycling to achieve a circular economy<br/><br/>The advanced manufacturing technologies that are available today do not have a natural route to implementation in industry. CR3 brings together key constituencies in the resource recovery and recycling area to develop comprehensive technology transfer pathways to industry. The primary focus of CR3 is on key sectors of iron and steel, non-ferrous structural metals, light metals, rare-earths, energy materials and photovoltaic metals, high value refractory metals and electronic materials. Technology development addresses the product manufacturing wastes, post-consumer wastes, instrumentation, sensors and controls, design for disassembly and conversion of trash to treasure. There are a number of key industry challenges in the area of resource recovery and recycling: specifically, scarcity of feed stock materials and increasing cost of material resources, increasing amounts of waste from industrial processes as well as end-of-life products, need for solutions for resource recovery, reuse, and recycling of critical materials, need for energetically favorable, environmentally compatible and economically viable industrial processes. These challenges are addressed by CR3 through the development of physical and chemical processes for secondary resource sortation, beneficiation and concentration, as well as value-extraction.

To reshore jobs, improve operations, and recruit, retain, and retrain skilled workers, companies are increasingly using robotics technology. Ideally, robots will not replace humans but team with them to improve productivity. However, most industrial robots are poorly integrated into human workflow, causing expensive work stoppage problems ($1.7M per hour), worker stress, and talent loss.  The research goal of this project is to address this problem by designing novel methods to improve human-robot workflow and productivity in assembly manufacturing through the use of an intelligent material delivery system (IMDS), which will closely integrate with and support the manual work process. This project will investigate innovative, multi-disciplinary approaches to this research area, dramatically advancing the state-of-the art in smart manufacturing and human-centered robotics. <br/><br/>The research team will make the following contributions to human-centered smart service systems: 1) Revolutionize the use of robotics in assembly manufacturing processes to closely support skilled human workers, enabling them to focus on tasks they value (their trade) as opposed to tasks that distract from their talent (material movement). 2) Dramatically improve the productivity and flexibility of factories through nimble, real-time scheduling of an IMDS system that dynamically incorporates real-time models of human workflow. 3) Deeply explore the socio-technical implications of having an IMDS system in the workplace, in terms of human workers' cognition, fatigue, affect, and job satisfaction. The project's approach serves as a direct contrast to industry state-of-the-art, which relies on strict bifurcation of human and robot work, and rigid delivery schedules that fail to take local trim-line variations into account. By closely integrating an IMDS into the manual work process and understanding worker and material status, the project will readily enable flexibility and reconfigurability of a human workforce, an absolute necessity in made-to-order, small-batch manufacturing settings. <br/><br/>This project will help the US manufacturing sector dramatically improve their operations by using automation to directly support a talented, skilled workforce. It has the potential to impact all major US manufacturing sectors, including automotive, construction, healthcare, energy, and goods. It will help US companies reshore operations, as well as create new opportunities for US worker STEM skill acquisition. Furthermore, this project involves a detailed investigation of multiple human worker implications of the transition from traditional to intelligent material delivery using robotics. By understanding reactions to such change, there will be new understanding on how to optimize a system not only for workflow and task efficiency but also for the human experience. Such knowledge is critical to maintaining job satisfaction, safety and health, and long-term well-being of the human workforce.<br/><br/>The lead institution is the University of Notre Dame, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics (Cambridge, MA) and University of Colorado at Boulder, Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering (Boulder, CA).

Commercial and residential buildings are responsible for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve the required reduction in global emissions without substantive reductions from buildings. Despite this need, current buildings commonly consume significantly higher amounts of energy and emit more pollutants than predicted during the building design process. Prediction inaccuracies persist partly because engineers and archi-tects seldom receive any feedback as to actual energy performance and partly because there is a lack of deeply integrated knowledge regarding building equipment, operation and grid/environmental in-teractions in a way that a designer can utilize. The center for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) plans to address the lack of integration and feedback with a convergence of multidisci-plinary research expertise to address inaccuracies in building energy predictions with the vision of developing a scientifically rigorous transformation to the building design process. The activities will also support an increase in scientific literacy, U.S. competitiveness, and industry collaborations by disseminating center outcomes to relevant professional societies, educating high-volumes of students in this field and construction of high-value research infrastructure.<br/><br/>Many next-generation buildings to not achieve optimal efficiency and minimal environmental impact as a result of a lack of feedback from the occupied building and a lack of deeply integrated knowledge between building equipment and operation that the designer can utilize.

A broad commercial potential is in fault-detection in condition-monitoring systems for motors and generators, where faults due to occurrences such as over-fluxing or magnetization can lead to major damage, costly repairs and production downtime.  The atomic probe addresses an unmet need for reliable, localized measurements up to several Tesla of magnetic field within and surrounding conductive components in rotating machines for early fault detection.  The technology also promises to expand capabilities of laboratory measurement instrumentation and contribute to experimental high magnetic field science requiring advanced instrumentation for measurement in the 1 to 100 Tesla range.

This technology is significant because asphalt supplies are diminishing rapidly since the advent and adaptation of coking technologies by refineries. Accordingly, this PFI project will result in a proof-of-concept for BRAS for use in pavement construction. The newly developed product, BRAS, is low-cost, durable and environmentally friendly, features that improve pavement service life while reducing pavement construction cost and carbon footprint. In addition, the production of BRAS uses products from two waste streams (scrap shingles and animal waste), which also provides a cost-effective waste management solution. Thus, BRAS is superior in terms of cost savings, extended durability, environmental impact and energy savings when compared to the existing products in the construction industry.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The supply of asphalt binder found in scrap shingles are highly oxidized from years of prior service. Oxidation typically disturbs colloidal stability of asphalt structure by converting maltene portions and increasing asphaltene aggregation. Accordingly, this PFI project is using specific molecular species extracted from animal waste to restore asphalt stability and enhance its properties. A multi-scale modeling and characterization followed by experiments and prototyping will be used to develop BRAS with properties similar to that of virgin asphalt binder.  The project will involve research scholars and students with mechanical, chemical and material science expertise to undertake this research. Students and scholars involved in the project will receive entrepreneurship training while conducting customer interviews and meetings with potential industry partners to facilitate technology scale-up."

According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1""), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.<br/><br/>Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1""), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets."

The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path.

The subject is a machine and materials set that can provide exponentially faster object generation at high resolution. This system leverages several familiar technologies in a new way to provide a path for 3D printing, generally considered reserved for the high-tech sectors, to become accessible to everyone. Because the new method is so rapid, detailed, and the materials are so diverse, it is poised to enhance plastics manufacturing profit margins by eliminating mold costs in many cases. In this way, many American business forced to outsource overseas will be able to maintain domestic production and increase the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. In addition, the manufacturing of the consumables will also enhance job creation. When this new method is fully adopted, its use in the medical field will make lifesaving and life enhancing prosthetic, implantable, and pharmaceutical testing applications much more cost effective, fundable by Medicare, benefiting all our citizens. By servicing a higher percentage of the general plastics manufacturing $600B industry, as well as professional designers, engineers, technical professionals, and the medical and scientific community, the new system in its many forms will eventually be of benefit to nearly every industry in the US, increasing the growth and practical value of the 3D market sector.<br/><br/><br/>The subject invention is unique in its use of multiple disciplines simultaneously. As a solid-state system, pressure-biased build material presses up against a glass screen, which is micro-porous, and is laced with the same kind of electronics as are found in flat screen displays. The discrete addressing normally reserved for video images, known as row-and-column refresh rates, is instead used to activate resistive material generating micro-heat spots in this open weave configuration. The heat stimulates the build material to transit the glass and solidify topside, at 1000 dpi resolution, or 1 million droplets per square inch. These high-resolution droplets conjoin and cool, as an entire layer is created at once at 30-120 times a second with no mechanical heads tracking back and forth. The objects should seem to simply appear on the glass at about one to seven vertical inches per minute, depending on the refresh rate, at virtually any planar size, and can be used right away, since no post-curing treatment is needed. Integrating an activated video matrix to build entire cross sections at once, increases speed exponentially. The pores in the glass rely on the known science of Microfluidics, a highly refined means of moving an entire 2D matrix of liquid, to eliminate costly and slow mechanization, and will be studied in this application. Robust and diverse materials have been developed for many embodiments and will be tested. Optimizing first in Multiphysics simulation, and then fabricating a simplified Proof of Concept in Phase I, should provide compelling evidence for continued work on this novel method in Phase II."

Microalgae production is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock, as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.   However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption; 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated CO2."

Furthermore, current AM output suffers from imprecision, poor quality, inconsistency, and lack of durability. Additionally, legacy Metallic AM platforms are large, expensive, operate at high temperatures, and are isolated from the engineers who rely on them.

The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.<br/><br/>The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings."

Examples include improved performance of light harvesting systems for energy production and designs for smaller higher performance antennas for broadband communications.  The CfM works closely with members to address fundamental and precompetitive questions regarding the design and fabrication of metamaterials with customized properties. Fundamental questions include how radiation can be made to interact more strongly with the meta-atoms that compose the metamaterial. It is these interactions that lead to new approaches for engineering designs for improved technologies ranging from imaging sensors to improved heat sinks. The projects conducted within the CfM are developed collaboratively with the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) deciding on the viability of metamaterials solutions for achieving smaller, better, lower-cost and higher performance products for both commercial and defense deployment. The global metamaterials market sector is growing fast and through the CfM, members remain current and competitive on the many emerging technology opportunities.

The inability to meet future food demands places more pressure on the one billion individuals currently underfed and living in substandard conditions throughout the world. These limitations will manifest into amplified social pressures such as, but not limited to, increased rates of disease, demand for land and water resources, and a lack of agricultural entrepreneurship, which only further weakens the global economy. A sustainable method (i.e., practical and economical) for remediating agricultural waste, while producing high value protein is essential to the long-term health of ecosystems and agriculture. One solution is the utilization of insect farming to convert organic wastes, which will potentially produce alternate resources of monetary value for the farmer. Insect farming can produce enormous amounts of protein and lipids that can be used in a variety of commodity settings (e.g., feed production, compost, biofuels, human food in some cases).  Additionally, this production of alternative protein sources is less environmentally straining than most currently used methods in terms of reduced arable land, water usage and reduced emissions.<br/><br/>The Center for Environmental Sustainability through Insect Farming (CESTIns) will be comprised of three sites (Indiana University-Purdue University in Indianapolis [IUPUI], Texas A&M AgriLife Research [TAMU], and Mississippi State University [MSU]), with each site specializing in a specific area of research.  The IUPUI site will be focused on the genetics and genomics of the insect systems, evaluating the heritability of traits, a determination of the genetic contribution to traits, protein and other nutrients' extraction methods, and the public's perception and attitudes towards insects as food and feed.  IUPUI will work with the other sites to integrate research thrusts across the three sites with MSU and TAMU focusing on insect biology, microbiology, and engineering and feed trials. Through this research, new knowledge and technologies that fill critical scientific and industrial gaps that relate to the insect farming as related to livestock and aquaculture production. Further, all three sites will work with strains produced by Industry as well as strains developed internally as a means to optimize mass production. Laboratory and field-based experiments will also engage interdisciplinary expertise in microbiology, engineering, chemistry, food science, physiology, and vertebrate biology with cutting edge technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to an applied mechanical stress.  Piezoelectric ceramics are important because they play critical role in daily use devices including automobiles, aircrafts, medical instruments, food processing, and house-hold electronics. This project will result in scale-up of the manufacturing process of a particular type of piezoelectric ceramic: textured piezoelectric ceramics. Textured ceramics have the following unique features: three-to-five times higher transduction coefficients, thermal stability over high temperatures, and mechanical robustness as compared to randomly oriented polycrystalline ceramics. These features provide the following advantages: higher efficiency, resolution, cost savings, miniaturization, and power density. Textured ceramics can be synthesized using the same process as that established for random ceramics and thus do not require any new tooling or equipment.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The sintering stages in achieving textured ceramics will be analyzed to identify the challenges associated with scaling the manufacturing process to ensure consistent production. This includes establishing the process for synthesizing the seeds in large quantities with adequate morphology and dimension, and tailoring the binder-burnout and sintering profiles. The effect of processing variables that play a deterministic role in achieving the large grain brick-wall like microstructure will be evaluated. Matrix/seed template interfaces in the microstructure will be investigated using high resolution microscopy to understand the nature of domain wall motion with applied electric field. This, in turn, will provide assessment of the processes controlling the mechanical and electrical aging behavior. In conjunction with the time-temperature dependent sintering studies, the field-stress dependent domain migration studies will provide a full understanding of the electromechanical behavior of the textured ceramics. <br/><br/>In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experiences through Virginia Tech's Catalyst program, KnowledgeWorks entrepreneurship events, participation in the Nexus Conference, and participation in the iScholars program.<br/><br/>The project engages Harris Corporation, Prime Photonics, and the Virginia Tech Intellectual Property Office to augment the team's research capability, provide access to industrial testing and manufacturing environment, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.<br/><br/>Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It would bridge a gap between commercial biomanufacturing/pharmaceutical development and the academic state-of-the-art.  Moreover, the proposed technology will provide the scientific community with novel tools to perturb and observe how individual cells interact with each other and with their microenvironment.  Probing biological signatures at single-cell resolution underpins major current trends in biomedical research, from clinical applications in cancer therapy, diagnostics, and immunology, to global basic science initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas project.  The goal of this grant is to facilitate commercialization of a single-cell handling instrument for use in research universities and pharmaceutical R&D laboratories.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop an automated instrument for seeding organoids or other 3D tissue cultures with single-cell resolution.  Organoids have the potential to transform personalized medicine and disease modelling, but current culture methods are poorly controlled, leading to wide variability between individual samples and across labs.  It is recognized that standardization, reproducibility, and tight control of cell seeding parameters will be paramount for drawing predictive value from organoids in the clinic, particularly when many statistical replicates are required.  The technology developed is a high-resolution robotic cell printing instrument capable of rapidly and deterministically seeding single cells contained within sub-nanoliter liquid volumes.  The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the proposed cell printing technology to seed organoid cultures with complete control of the type and number of constituent cells in each organoid.  Using Lgr5+ stem cell-derived intestinal organoids as a model culture system, protocols will be developed for preparing ""printer-ready"" input single stem cells from primary tissue.

Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be toxic or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns (such as recent ""red tide"" events in Florida, USA) and drastic economic consequences (i.e. deadly effects of harmful algal blooms on the aquaculture industry). The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collection and evaluation using a benchtop microscope or optical digital imaging system. In contrast, the proposed platform will be transformative by enabling low-cost, portable and fast monitoring and automated characterization of aquatic microorganisms. Therefore, this platform will revolutionize monitoring of aquatic microorganisms and, being low cost, it will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets. Some of these future applications include more efficient biofuels research and development (via algae monitoring), marine biology science and education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, production algae monitoring. Therefore, the potential societal impact and commercial potential of the proposed technology is transformative.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop and evaluate a portable, rapid, durable and environmentally-stable imaging flow-cytometry technology that will automatically monitor microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and pathogens present in the flowing water, and will be capable of specific classification. Existing optics-based flow-cytometry solutions are expensive and not durable for field use. Unlike lab-based flow cytometers or hand-held assays, the proposed system will not rely on reagents or labeling, and therefore will not need an expert/professional, and will keep the evaluated water unchanged. Thus, it can be installed for continual unattended operation and will be much more cost-effective per test due to elimination of an expert's time, costly reagents and fluorophores. Furthermore, the proposed system will also be integrated with a machine learning engine capable of automated identification of microorganisms as well as other micro-objects of interest. Finally, the proposed system will be evaluated on pre-collected samples of local coastal ocean water to determine the presence of three example types of phytoplankton microorganisms and to provide statistical distribution of all of the detected micro-objects.

Sensing hydrogen is important because it is very flammable if is mixed with ordinary air (due to the oxygen content in the air). Thus, a sensor is needed in applications requiring or containing hydrogen such as fuel cells, some batteries, hydrogen powered vehicles, etc. <br/><br/>This project will result in a prototype handheld device that combines the sensor chip with a digital meter for direct readout of test results; the H2 sensor chip is also adaptable to batteries, fuel cells, and existing air quality monitoring equipment for real-time H2 detection. This NC-RGO sensor chip has the following unique features: rapid response for real-time monitoring, micron-sized dimensions, high sensitivity, scalable fabrication, and wireless communication compatibility. Compared to current hydrogen sensors in the marketplace, these features provide fast response, superior sensitivity/selectivity, portability, low-cost, and facile connection with smart phones/devices. <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  The NC-RGO sensing platform will be further improved in order to realize the low-cost, reliable, ultrasensitive H2 detection for various applications (e.g., H2 fuel cells, vehicles, lead-acid batteries, and air quality monitoring for indoor spaces) associated with H2. Various sensor characteristics will be investigated and validated, including sensor sensitivity, selectivity, long-term stability, performance in different operating conditions (e.g., various humidity values), and calibration methods. Insights into the NC-RGO sensing platform will advance the understanding of the interaction mechanism between gas molecules and low-dimensional materials in hybrid structures. Such understanding can further contribute to the design of nanomaterials with desirable properties to identify active sites and rates of catalytic reactions on metal/metal oxide NCs and to provide guidelines for performance enhancement through engineering properties of NCs. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates (including underrepresented students) and graduate students, will receive innovation and entrepreneurship training experiences through interacting with industrial partners and additional entrepreneurship training through I-Corps.<br/><br/>The project engages NanoAffix Science LLC., Johnson Controls, and A.O.

At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs.

It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.<br/><br/><br/>The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach to water purification will address the need for technologies with the capability of removing toxic chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, chemical waste products, and pesticides that can not be effectively removed using conventional means.  This high throughput water purifier is important because it has the potential to remove most organic contaminants from water as well as to disinfect the water of harmful viruses and bacteria.  The technology can be used in water reuse applications where wastewater can be treated with this plasma method to reduce contaminant levels well below maximum allowable concentrations so that it can be utilized for both potable (drinking) and non-potable applications (such as boiler water, car washing and firefighting).  This capability makes communities resilient against drought and even chemical spills.  The technology also has the potential to reduce industrial costs and associated environmental damage by treating highly toxic wastewater to the point where it can be reused at the factory.  <br/><br/>This project will result in a prototype high throughput plasma purifier and will test the plasma purifier at actual municipal and industrial wastewater plants to demonstrate function and scalability in a real setting. The high throughput plasma purifier has the following unique features: 1) scalability, 2) it does not require consumables to operate, and 3) it drives a multitude of chemical processes in water that rapidly reduce contaminants to carbon dioxide and water. These features provide the advantages of performance, e.g. rapid decomposition of contaminants and cost savings, does not require consumables such as toxic chlorine or peroxide, offers high electrical and chemical conversion efficiency, and provides ease of implementation ranging from point-of-use applications to integration as modules into an actual water treatment plant.  Conventional advanced oxidation methods supporting water treatment applications require the use of toxic consumables to drive specialized reactions to generate oxidants as well as the infrastructure to house and apply the chemicals. The high throughput purifier produces plasma for water treatment using regular air thereby eliminating the need for costly consumables and the associated expense of infrastructure to store and apply such chemicals. <br/><br/>This project addresses the technology gap of scalability as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. Though plasma-based water treatment has been investigated in the past, with impressive decomposition efficiencies, its widespread application has remained elusive.   This is due largely to the difficulty in scaling up beyond laboratory demonstration of 10s of ml in fixed volumes to the 10s of liters/min in once-through, flowing water applications. The key innovation of this reactor is the geometrical deconstruction of water into a form such that plasma coverage of water flowing through the reactor is maximized.  The surface plasma reacts with the water generating radicals that subsequently treat the core water. In the course of executing this proposed effort, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in applied science, technology translation, product development, and entrepreneurship. This effort will also administer a hands-on technical workshop aimed at K-12 students with focus on women and under-represented minorities that explores advanced water treatment and entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>The project engages a number of key partners. These partners include the a municipal waste water plant, a municipal drinking water plant, a semiconductor manufacturing company, and two engineering consultancies that actually design drinking and waste water plants, and the National Sanitation Foundation.  In this manner, municipal drinking water and wastewater, industrial wastewater, and advanced water testing facilities will be made available to this project supporting piloting in a relevant test environment and assessing the effectiveness of treatment based on accepted standards in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality."

Janus colloids for consumer products are not commercially available, in part, due to the lack of a scale technology that can i) drive the required translational research needed for fundamental insight and development and ii) be scaled to meet potential industry demand.  The technology presented in this proposal overcomes these major bottlenecks towards the commercialization of Janus colloids that could lead to job growth, as the patents developed from this proposal will be licensed to a newly developed enterprise. Furthermore, fundamental insights into polymer-polymer phase behavior at the nanoscale and structure-property relationships of Janus colloids will be a natural outcome of addressing the bottlenecks towards commercialization. The proposal will facilitate an extensive education and outreach program with one aim of expanding access to science and technology and encouraging entrepreneurship as a career path.<br/><br/>The proposed project addresses fundamental knowledge gaps which require understanding prior to the scale up of Flash NanoPrecipitation for the production and first-to-market commercialization of Janus colloids in consumer products.  The study provides fundamental insights into how combining colloid formation using rapid micro-mixing and kinetically arrested precipitation with polymer phase separation at the nanoscale can lead to the production of Janus colloids. Commercialization requires connecting processing parameters of Flash NanoPrecipitation with the molecular parameters of the polymers from which the Janus colloids are assembled: process-structure relationship studies. The second-level of structure and property relationship is the connection between the geometry and properties of Janus colloids, as amphiphiles to the desired properties for formulations in personal- and health-care products.  In particular, this proposal aims to develop the rules of biocompatible Janus colloid production by understanding how polymer-polymer interactions, interfacial properties, and molecular characteristics, e.g., molecular weight and glass transition, influence the structure of Janus colloids.  Structure will be evaluated using state-of-the art three-dimensional microscopy tools.  Furthermore, the work aims to reveal how Janus colloids stabilize emulsions and foams with respect to different formulations and process parameters including stability against centrifugal fields, temperature and polarity which will lead to enhanced formulation properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our product aims to improve early childhood STEM learning by supporting the preschool workforce. Children's development in math and science at the end of preschool predicts how well they will do in multiple subjects later in school. Our professional development tools will empower teachers to provide rich early STEM experiences so that all children, regardless of background, have the opportunity to be better students. These experiences also build habits of mind, inquiry, and interest in STEM, which can result in a stronger, larger, and more innovative STEM workforce. The business could develop a national footprint that employs educators and experts from across the country to provide professional development, online supports and resources, and innovative technology to educators, school districts, and other preschool education organizations. The reach and impact of the project could expand rapidly through emerging technologies. The business can fulfill a massive need in our society to improve early childhood education by providing quality professional development and support for those educating our youngest learners. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of our preschool professional development model and resources, SciMath-DLL.

The motivation for CANFSA is to address the national decline in the training of students in this area that is critical to U.S. dominance in high performance materials, structures and advanced manufacturing. Today, there are only a few universities remaining who train students in these core science and engineering areas that are so critical to our industries, especially as National investments are made in new advanced materials and manufacturing strategies. In fact, these declines have greatly reduced&#8232; the synergies that existed previously between faculty, students, and the relevant industries, and this, in turn, has significantly weakened the technical dominance of US industries that rely heavily&#8232; on these materials. CANFSA was organized to counter this trend by conducting fundamental scientific studies on these advanced materials and their manufacturing, thereby filling this workforce development gap and simultaneously contributing to U.S. global industrial competitiveness.<br/><br/>The objective of CANFSA is to conduct basic and applied physical metallurgy &#8232;research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced &#8232;non-ferrous structural alloys, and to train students in these important subjects. This is accomplished by engaging students in topics of importance to industry and government labs, and to have both faculty members and external mentors guide the students' fundamental research. The specific details of the projects that are conducted within the Center vary as topics are selected that have the most direct relevance for the partners from industry and the national laboratories. To date, the Center has conducted leading research in the areas of:  thermal and mechanical processing of non-ferrous alloys (e.g., 3rd Generation Al-Li alloys, texture anisotropy of Ti-6Al-4V); ultrafine grained alloys and their mechanical behavior (e.g., Ti and Mg); aging of high-strength beta-Ti alloys; processing of microeutectic Al alloys; microstructural evolution (e.g., Ni-Ti-Hf intermetallics, Ni-based superalloys, high entropy alloys); multi-layer coatings; lube-free die casting; and the role of trace elements and small microstructural variations on mechanical properties. To conduct these varied research projects and accomplish the goals of the Center, faculty members with complementary &#8232;expertise in the areas of theory, modeling, processing and characterization are working together with members from industry and government laboratories. Iowa State University has a variety of processing, characterization, and computational tools available on which to conduct the Center?s research. This includes state-of-the-art electron microscopy and atom probe capabilities in a newly established Sensitive Instrumentation Facility and elsewhere across ISU's campus. In addition, researchers have access to a variety of advanced processing equipment and computational tools that span across a wide range of methods, including: atomistic simulation techniques; discrete dislocation dynamics; phase field simulation; cellular automata; finite element methods and FFT-based simulation approaches.

WEP research focuses on creating new sensors and devices, novel materials, innovative water treatment systems, and water policies that will help change the way the world manages its acutely stressed water resources.  The new sensing technologies will address major drawbacks of the existing water contaminant detection methods to provide early warning of water contamination and avoid catastrophes.  New materials and processes are proposed for water conveyance systems which could reduce energy and water loss due to corrosion and leakage from water pipes. Projects focusing on water treatment systems will lead to new water filtration and reuse technologies through efficient and low-cost removal of contaminants.  The water policy-related projects will develop policy components to assess risks, promote benefits, and identify opportunities to advance water technology.  The envisioned projects will benefit potential and current WEP I/UCRC industry companies by enabling new or additional capabilities for their water equipment to increase product performance, market share, profits, and job creation.  The proposed program aims to train the current and future workforce at the frontier of water equipment and policy.

A portfolio of real-time sensing technologies has been proposed which includes optical fiber technology, single live cell technology, electrochemical technology, acoustic wave technology, and field-effect transistor technology.  Novel surface microstructures and high-performance superhydrophobic concrete and coatings are proposed to minimize maintenance cost and pumping energy for water components.  Self-healing and wear-resistant coatings are proposed to reduce water leakage.  Novel photocatalytic nanomaterials are proposed for water treatment.  Several technologies are proposed to address emerging contaminants such as pathogens and micropollutants and an advanced, rapid wet-weather treatment process is proposed to safely treat stormwater.  A localized model will be developed to predict nutrient transport in Lake Michigan and inform decision making to minimize algal blooms, beach closures, and clogging of water intakes.

The use of waste as a feedstock for a clean fuel (void of chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen) will prevent ecological damage, due to landfilling, and will advance the health and welfare of the American public by reduced air emissions. The pellets are of high calorific value and at low cost that will compete with fossil coal, increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. This effort is enhancing partnerships between academia and industry (two partners from the academia and one from the industry) in the U.S. The program has significant educational contributions, both at Michigan Technological University and the University of Idaho, and will prepare Ph.D. students for this emerging field in the workplace. Finally, this work will improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the U.S., by advancing this area. <br/><br/>The proposed project deals with torrefaction of solid waste that comprises mostly fiber and plastic to convert them into clean, high-calorific-value solid fuels. The main challenges in using solid wastes for energy applications are: (1) inhomogeneity within the waste streams; (2) materials in the waste that are hazardous to the environment and equipment, such as chlorine and potassium; and (3) the converted fuel should be grindable to enable its applications in coal-fired boilers.  The team, comprising two academic institutions and a commercial entity, is developing new approaches to solve these hurdles.   Inhomogeneity is being resolved by sorting metals and glass and blending the sorted waste with fiber or plastic waste to obtain a consistent blend.  Torrefaction is helping to solve the two latter hurdles.  During torrefaction, the material becomes brittle and hence can be pulverized to the required size.  The hazardous materials are removed after torrefaction, by dissolving the brittle material in aqueous solution that dissolved the hazardous material, specifically chlorine and potassium.  Plastic has been found to play a major role in the quality of final pellets, as it increases the calorific value and enables producing high density pellets that are safe, durable, and water resistant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.<br/><br/>This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community."

Photovoltaics (PV), or solar cells, are solid-state semiconductor-based devices that converts sunlight directly to electricity and do not generate pollution, emissions, or greenhouse gases during operation.  The IUCRC for Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV or the Center) is one of the world's leading PV research consortia.  The NGPV promotes science and advances prosperity and welfare through the Center's successful, ongoing research and education programs. These programs are focused on bringing down PV system cost, increasing PV system efficiency, and enabling widespread the use of PV electricity. The Center's research vision is to make PV electricity a major source of energy. There are currently three research sites in the Center: Colorado State University (CSU), The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), and Texas A&M University (TAMU).The CSU site of NGPV is focused on reducing the cost of solar energy through advancing thin film PV device performance, performing state-of-the-art materials characterization, streamlining manufacturing and improving module reliability.  The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based: students from different disciplines including a significant number of women and veterans work closely with each other, with engineers from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities. Three key PV technologies, developed at CSU, have been translated to industry.  <br/><br/>A key goal of the CSU site is to continue to advance the state of the art by developing more sophisticated CdTe based device structures with higher efficiencies and improved understanding through advanced materials and electronic characterization.  Recently, the CSU site demonstrated device efficiency of 19.2%, the highest efficiency demonstrated for polycrystalline CdTe materials by any academic or national laboratory worldwide. These advances have been demonstrated on pilot scale systems with a direct line of sight to industrial manufacturing. A key research thrust is to demonstrate still higher cell efficiencies, with 25% being a realistic near-term (3 year) goal and 30% the longer term goal. The unique co-sublimation technology developed at CSU will be utilized for the fabrication of the advanced device structures. In addition to improving device efficiencies, research focus at CSU has progressed to improve module efficiency, improve reliability and facilitate deployment. The efforts will lead to lower LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and help facilitate the goal of 2-3 cents/kWhr. Overall, center has the potential to further increase the impact of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. PV industry that is growing rapidly and greatly expand the application of solar electricity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research effort of the Columbia University Site aims at industry/university cooperative research to harvest energy through modern structural materials and designs of civil infrastructure systems. Given the intensive material and energy requirements in the building and transportation sectors, working toward energy harvesting through building envelopes and infrastructure surfaces is critical for sustainable development. The general framework within the Site Center is to work on materials development, system integration tools, and modeling to optimize the performance of energy harvesting technologies and devices. Because most energy is used in civil infrastructure, directly harvesting energy through the infrastructure will reduce costs of energy storage and transmission, produce synergistic life cycle benefits to the infrastructure system, and enhance the national energy security and safety. Columbia's research program is nurtured by the dynamic enterprise industry and large market of the NYC metropolitan area, and will offer excellent opportunities for us to recruit and engage underrepresented students in the research and education activities, providing interdisciplinary study experience to young scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The multidisciplinary research team will perform research on industry-driven projects with the objective of translating laboratory prototypes into commercial products; build on interdisciplinary strengths in science and technology, and; develop strong collaborations with industry. We will use a holistic approach to design and develop multifunctional building envelopes and infrastructure surfaces, through which the interactions and potential synergies between the various material and structural behaviors, energy harvesting and efficiency performance, and human behaviors are properly understood, modeled, and exploited, while eliminating or minimizing any potentially detrimental consequences or interactions. In addition, we will also develop effective sensing and monitoring systems and accelerated testing methods for maximized energy harvesting efficiency and life cycle cost performance. As the first step to make a transformative change for energy harvesting through civil engineering infrastructure through the following five research thrusts: 1) Multifunctional advanced materials and structures for energy harvesting and efficiency; 2) Energy converting devices for solar, geothermal, and mechanics energy harvesting and storage, such as battery and fuel cells; 3) Roadway energy harvesting systems with infrastructure protection; 4) Energy efficient buildings with energy harvesting and wireless sensing; and 5) Life cycle analysis and testing of energy harvesting materials and systems."

Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach.

Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping."

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created.

The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome.

The collaborative research conducted under the CAFS umbrella focuses on optimizing genetic and cultural systems to produce high-quality raw materials for new and existing forest products industries. <br/><br/>Over the past 50 years, much forestry research has taken place in university-based, industry-supported, cooperative research programs. These ""coops"" continue be extraordinarily successful at achieving research and technological advances on topics of great relevance to the forest industry. However, the ability to focus on specific disciplinary topics in response to industrial guidance is also a limitation. Many of the problems and opportunities facing forestry today, bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries. For technological advances to be made, it is necessary to approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The proposed Center (CAFS) has been successful at providing the administrative structure and funding that has allowed scientists from these existing cooperatives to initiate much need cross-disciplinary research in areas of genetics, site manipulation, and growth and yield modeling. The proposal presents a plan for the 2nd five-year phase for the four original university CAFS sites, North Carolina State, Oregon State, Purdue, and Virginia Tech. This proposal also serves as a research and administrative template for the other five university sites that have joined CAFS since its interception in late 2007. <br/><br/>The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Member organizations of the Center benefit by becoming knowledgeable about a wider range of technological capabilities. In addition, technology transfer between Center scientists and member personnel fosters rapid implementation of new technologies. The broader scientific community benefits through refereed publications and presentations at scientific meetings.

Leading sunscreens that are currently on the market have been shown to be inadequate in protection against UVA damage (photoaging). Moreover, Oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are found in over 80% of chemical sunscreens, have been shown to be highly toxic to coral cells. Estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen settle into the world?s coral reefs every year and the oxybenzone that is present in many of these sunscreens cause coral bleaching and accelerate the destruction of the world?s already fragile coral reefs. The Magic Blue sunscreen uses an alternative eco-friendly technology to protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage, and the successful commercialization/market adoption of the Magic Blue sunscreen will significantly benefit the global environment by protecting our aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs, from further oxybenzone/octinoxate-induced damage. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel coral reef-friendly sunscreen that can provide broad spectrum protection. Magic Blue, LLC is partnering with the University of Maryland, College Park and collaborating with the Carnegie Institution for Science to conduct the key feasibility experiments, including biological analysis of UVA protection in 2D and 3D human skin tissues, chemical assays on SPF determination, and environmental study on the effects of the new sunscreen on soft and hard coral reefs.  Once these experiments are complete, Phase II of the project will revolve around obtaining necessary FDA approval for commercial launch. The overall outcome from a successful STTR project will be the commercialization of the world?s first sunscreen that will encompass the following attributes: scientifically proven to protect against UVA-induced photoaging, abilities to provide sufficient UVB protection and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and safe to coral reefs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People with a loss of their sense of smell are typically  concerned about being near potential hazards that are difficult to detect without a sense of smell, such as fires, gas leaks, food that is spoiling, and hazardous chemicals. As there are no methods or products that can closely mimic the human nose, the detection performance and user-friendliness of a substitute device will target a relatively untapped market -- approximately 5% of the general population or over 15 million people in the United States alone. It is anticipated that this project's device will be a more affordable, reliable and less invasive alternative to surgery or other treatments. Furthermore, the technology can be used in a wide range of applications, such as drug or explosives detection, food quality monitoring (such as identifying diseases and/or ripeness of fruits and other produce), air quality monitoring and control, harmful solvent detection for defense application, and smart bandage for wound monitoring.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project involves the manufacture of a device with a high-density, high-performance gas sensor array based on nanotechnology, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The facile, fast fabrication methods of nanomaterials as sensing materials introduces the possibility of mass manufacturing. Real-time response to a range of gas analytes along with fast recovery of the sensing medium provides a solid technical foundation for this project. Currently at a pre-alpha prototyping stage, the device, with its full integration with a custom-designed circuit board and precisely fabricated sensing nanomaterials, not only eliminates the need for tedious and costly microfabrication, which is typical for gas sensors, but may also be able to imitate the detection level of a human nose, even exceeding the detection performance for some gas analytes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are key for multiple underwater missions including detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, ocean bed-floor, polluted water, as well as surveillance of coastal zones and coastal structures. In many circumstances AUVs are preferred over conventional towed instruments or marine surface vehicles because AUVs can get closer to the area of interest, they can cover large areas without constant monitoring or hover hazardous areas without putting at risk humans life. Although current AUVs have many capabilities, one main limitation is their inability to perform precise station-keeping which allows the vehicle to hold its position and adjust for currents. New technology in underwater propulsion will permit the development and control of a new generation of highly maneuverable vessels that have to operate in more challenging environments. The proposed work is expected to increase the partnership between academia, marine industries and national defense agencies. In addition, it will promote the progress of science and national security using bio-inspired technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses in the propulsion technology and control strategy for AUVs that needs to operate in tight space, low-speed with high mobility and perform station-keeping missions. Bio-inspired undulating fin can provide multiple advantages including: superior maneuverability to control forward motion and directional maneuver with a single undulating fin; precise maneuvers suitable for station-keeping and maneuvers in tight spaces; reduce risk to get tangled in marine plants and ropes with less impact on the marine ecosystem; relative low speed with likely lower acoustic signature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These considerations early in the research and design cycle are key to transitioning technologies out of academic laboratories and into the manufacturing sector. Expected broader impacts include competitive recruitment mechanisms and attractive cross-disciplinary collaborative research opportunities to engage excellent students and post-docs, including members of underrepresented groups and veterans. Knowledge dissemination includes publications, invention disclosures, and patents. Scalable prototyping processes developed and/or adapted for microfluidics will also be made available to academia and industry, including established companies and entrepreneurs, with a goal to dramatically reduce the learning curve and streamline the idea-to-product process. This center will help catalyze the generation of new knowledge and pre-competitive research results to enable the development of microfluidics based technologies to enable industry to address pressing societal needs.<br/> <br/>The goal of this center is to develop technologies for integrating and manufacturing labs-on-a-chip (LOCs) for easy diagnosis of the human health, agriculture, and the environment. The strategy for meeting this goal centers on mass-produced diagnostic devices equipped with microfluidic components, chip-sized devices with high sensitivities (nM - pM) and short assay times (< 30 min) -- capable of chemical analyses in miniaturized volumes (ul - pl). The few available  commercial microfluidic systems are expensive (costing up to hundreds of thousand dollars) and do not have effective sampling and analysis capability. What does not yet exist are mass-produced, cost-effective LOC platforms that integrate components to carry out multiple microfluidic/diagnostic functions and report results via a standard communications device.  A primary obstacle is the lack of integration-enabling and manufacturable LOCs capable of processing real-world samples. Innovation is needed on two related fronts: (a) employing and/or modifying existing scalable processes make microfluidic devices, and (b) designing LOCs that are autonomous, field deployable, and amenable to mass production. By working closely with industrial member companies, CADMIM will make significant strides towards commercialization of microfluidic technology, leading to new products, the creation of new companies and/or new divisions within existing firms, new jobs, and other tangible commercial and societal impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.<br/><br/><br/>Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them.

This digital enrichment system is important because animal husbandry, especially tasks related to animal welfare, take a great deal of caretaker time, money, and effort that can cause caretaker burnout. Contented animals are important to multiple industries: research animals undergo significant physiological and behavioral shifts under stress, which biases scientific studies; contented farm animals have increased immune function and need less medication; conservation breeding of endangered species depends on healthy breeding animals; and ease in pet keeping encourages the health benefits of pet ownership. <br/><br/>The project will result in a manufacture ready prototype for use with parrots that has the following features: it will offer toys and food items on a preprogramed schedule, track and log bird behavior, and run interactive ""apps"" that provide rewards for cognitive thinking challenges, exercise, and natural behavior expression. Parrots are an unusual group of animals, as they exist simultaneously in endangered conservation breeding, pet ownership, commercial pet breeding, and research laboratories. This proposed digital enrichment system's ability to provide many different types of stimuli at a cost of ~$300 per unit provides many advantages when compared to the $3,000-8,000 systems that exist the laboratory market and perform only limited husbandry tasks. There are basically no similar items in this primary market space, the companion bird market. Current state of the art in the market space for other species are items like monkey restraint chairs with levels and light panels, enriched poultry confinement cages (dust bath, perches, nest), and low functionality single species dog or cat products such as the iCPooch feeder.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery to commercial application. The complex actions and decisions made by positive reinforcement trainers must become a set of programmed instructions carried out by the app. The system requires specialized low processing power computer vision, and computer hearing that work in a variety of environments and for a variety of species. The technology must seamlessly integrate into the home of the animal, be low maintenance, replace person-hours of work, and be based on the best behavioral science.  These needs will be addressed by multidisciplinary teams of animal trainers, ornithologists, computer vision experts, computer programmers, and engineers working in the lab and aviary to create software and hardware combinations that overcome these technology gaps. The animal health and outcomes monitored will include immune function, body condition, bone density, and expression of natural behaviors. During development, the project will explore crossover applications for zoo and agricultural applications as appropriate. In addition, the project leaders will work with undergraduate and graduate students to provide them with hands-on experience working with industry partners and developing products for commercial applications.  <br/><br/>The project engages three important partners in this technology translation effort: The Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center (a research center with 150 publications on bird health), Hill Country Aviaries (housing and breeding about 2,000 birds of 60 species), and Chris Biro (a bird show owner who provides online training courses and engages several hundred thousand people in outreach annually).

Safety and capacity are the two most important characteristics of advanced batteries, but battery testing is currently limited to techniques that do not provide sufficient detail to properly assess the correct operation of a device. The technique developed herein is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is fast, completely non-invasive and can be performed on batteries while they are being charged or discharged. This proposal aims to clear technological hurdles towards implementing the methodology on a small footprint low-field and low-cost MRI instrumentation, which is an important step towards commercialization. Furthermore, the technique will be optimized for speed, tuned with regard to repeatability and reproducibility and will be adjusted to provide specific battery fingerprints, which can be used to classify cells. As a result, a proof-of-concept implementation of the technology will be developed, and the work may result in industrial partnerships, intellectual property development, and technology spinout.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ventilation noise in hospitals is detrimental to patient recovery, in schools is detrimental to student learning outcomes, and in communities is detrimental to restful sleep leading to increased stress. This project develops a noise control product concept to significantly improve the welfare of the American people in these areas. In addition to the beachhead market of building ventilation, the technology has applications in the automotive and heavy equipment industries, and in military stealth applications, potentially protecting the lives of the American warfighter. This project will enhance a partnership between academia and industry, potentially launching a new start-up. This PFI-TT project will engage one graduate student and one post-graduate student in active entrepreneurship while supporting participation of women in science, engineering, and entrepreneurship. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a prototype for a coaxial active noise cancelation device in ventilation ducts using carbon nanotube (CNT) thermophones. The technology provides an active silencer solution that allows the occupant to customize sound in real time, a unique market feature, with as much as an 80% size and weight reduction while improving air handler efficiency over current passive silencer technologies. The coaxial loudspeaker technology is enabled through carbon nanotechnology to create a compact speaker with no moving parts. The product is a drop-in replacement to existing duct systems and can be installed in line. Excessive noise from air handlers is detrimental in schools, theaters, hospitals, and in communities near industrial facilities. This technology aims to alleviate these noise burdens in an economical and safe way. The prototype developed under this program will be used to prove the technology to industry facility managers, value-added-resellers, and building engineers, who are historically risk-averse in adopting new technology. In particular, showing that the technology can be scaled to large ducts (6"" in diameter or more), that the device does not increase system backpressure, and that it has significant lifespan with limited maintenance will be key outcomes from this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the fastest growing, and most promising type of new drug candidates, are those based on proteins as the active ingredient.  However, there are a number of long-standing, industry-wide challenges that occur during the development and manufacturing of such ?pharmaceutical proteins?.  The proposed I/UCRC Site at the University of Delaware (UD) will bring world-class expertise to the existing Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD), in technical areas that are central to innovation for the development of pharmaceutical proteins (so-called biopharmaceuticals).  Examples include: more efficient purification processes, better product stability and reduced risk of side effects or unwanted immunogenic responses in patients, and improved control of manufacturing processes.  The proposed, expanded CPD will be the most far-reaching industry-university consortium to date that is focused on pharmaceutical product development, rather than the more traditional focus on ?upstream? research and drug-discovery activities.  The project areas it will address have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and economics of drug development science and engineering, as well as the fundamental understanding and education of engineers and scientists in the industry.  This can benefit the U.S. broadly in terms of domestic job creation, as well as improved time to market, cost to patients, and reduced risk for investors, based on the development and testing of new therapeutic proteins (sole focus of the UD Site) and innovator pharmaceutical products more generally (focus of CPD overall).  <br/><br/>The major technical areas for the biopharmaceutical industry that are the focus on the UD site for the CPD include: (i) commercial and pilot-scale bioreactors to produce recombinant protein for use as a drug; (ii) extensive purification to produce essentially pure therapeutic protein in aqueous solution; (iii) formulation of the purified protein to assure multi-year stability, robust manufacturing, and effective delivery to patients; (iv) analytical technologies and instrumentation to support extremely tight specifications at each of stages (i) to (iii). The faculty in the proposed UD Site for the CPD are world-recognized leaders in areas (i) to (iv), and will provide new strengths to the current CPD that complement the existing expertise in solid-state pharmaceutical stability and delivery, and development of industrial enzymes and related biotechnology products."

Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.<br/><br/>This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space."

The project is motivated by the opportunity to fill the gap in clinical practice and educational reading assessment by developing an ecological assessment of reading comprehension and retention. The assessment includes an automated evaluation of (a) immediate and delayed (24 hour) reading comprehension; and (b) reading strategy use and study skills using text appropriate for struggling readers in late high school and college. The integrated assessment and intervention program, RULE, will be of great interest to clinicians and educators responsible for working with students who have high level challenges in reading as currently there are no validated tools. The primary product will be a prototype of an automated assessment of reading comprehension that includes an evaluation of readers' use of Before Reading Strategies (e.g., preview with activation of existing knowledge), During Reading Strategies (e.g., notetaking, highlighting, and periodic review strategies), and Review Strategies (e.g., summarization and self testing strategies).  The assessment will be integrated with a reading strategy training program that was developed by the project team in their previous NSF CampusReader project. The automated and ecological nature of the RULE assessment will be desirable to the large market space of clinicians and educators who have very limited time thus are unable to personalize assessment and interventions as is required for high level reading comprehension impairments.<br/><br/>This project addresses the problem of appropriate use of clinician-time during assessment. It uses technology that can assist the clinician by automating tedious and error-prone portions of an assessment. In particular: (1) it will infer reading-strategy use from the reader's interaction with the RULE interface, and (2) when students are asked to provide a written summary of what they have read, RULE will automate assessment of that summary and potentially link errors in the summary with errors in use of reading-strategies, i.e., link writing errors with reading errors.<br/><br/>In addition to the listed project personnel, a multidisciplinary team of one undergraduate, one masters and one PhD student each from the Computer and Information Sciences and Communication Disorders & Sciences programs will be selected and will earn academic credit on the project in order to support their experience of working on a multidisciplinary technology development project with high clinical impact.

The membrane filtration technology developed allows for the separation of components of interest and value in the oil & gas, food & beverage, life sciences, textiles, and semiconductor manufacturing spaces in a more efficient manner than the methods in use today. By replacing these more expensive and energy intensive processes, the technology can provide a significant cost savings to the industrial end user, thereby generating surplus revenue, increased hiring capacity, and facilitating growth. In addition, the project will yield a societal benefit by providing a more effective and energy efficient approach for industrial process separations and wastewater treatment.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a robust membrane filtration technology. The membrane consists of commonly available thin-sheet silicon through which nanoscale pores are chemically etched using a simple patented process. These pores extend from one side of the silicon sheet to the other, thereby acting as channels through which water can flow. Molecules, particles, and other constituents of interest are rejected both by the physical size of the pores, and by the chemical character of the membrane surface, allowing for the removal, concentration, or separation of important components. The membrane offers a unique value proposition in that it combines a very small size cutoff offered by polymeric filters with the harsh environment compatibility of ceramic filters, while possessing excellent resistance to clogging and blockage. These properties enable low maintenance separation performance in a wide range of industrial applications where exposure to harsh environments such as high or low pH, organic solvents, and high temperatures is required.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The American health care delivery system falls short of care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, and equitable. Health care organizations are continually innovating in both management and clinical practices to address care efficiency shortcomings, offer the latest clinical technologies, and remain competitive. To attain significant progress on all of these fronts requires transformational changes in health organizations that fundamentally alter practices and culture, and lead to better health care. UL CHOT applies and refines a comprehensive transformation framework that will guide, research, and advance organization transformation in health systems, especially hospitals, clinics, and physician groups. With health spending rising exponentially, government, industry, and the public share growing concerns about a range of health care issues related to the organization and payment for health care services. New care models also require a shift in the types of clinicians that staff healthcare organizations. UL CHOT is committed to conducting research to understand what the optimal mix of these new services will be under new value-based ways of providing healthcare for the benefit of a diverse patient population. <br/><br/>UL CHOT's multi-disciplinary research team proposes to join the existing CHOT university sites, adding value through its in-depth integration of expertise in population health management, health information system design, and health systems sciences that will create new synergies that allows the research to be highly relevant, and incorporate best practices and the latest technology. UL CHOT will conduct mixed-methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change. Transformational efforts in health systems frequently ignore or prematurely treat several individual and organizational elements as ""fixed"" or immutable. Transformational strategies call for significant reexamination and, often, realignment of values, processes, and structures characterizing a health system. Such major innovations (i.e., LEAN, cutting-edge clinical innovations and information systems) call for leadership, significant cultural change, inter-professional alignment, elements of process reengineering, and effective monitoring and feedback. Our industry-guided research program identifies the factors that produce desired results from these kinds of transformational interventions in health systems. UL CHOT will contribute significantly to the efficiency and quality of care offered by industry partners by enabling more effective implementation of the aforementioned tools and strategies."

CAFS and its sites address the problems and opportunities facing forestry that bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries, and require a broader and interdisciplinary approach that is the hallmark of universities. The center and its sites approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The UW site will advance research in Phase II consistent with member needs such as it has done in Phase I in areas including 1) regional fertilization response of Douglas-fir, 2) growth and yield of improved Douglas-fir stock, and 3) use remote sensing to describe leaf area and root biomass of Douglas-fir plantations. <br/><br/>Forests are vital to global ecological, social, and economic health. The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Student training continues to be an important feature in Center research and technology transfer. These students are unique in the forestry sciences because of their problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Recruiting for students among under-represented groups will be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline."

Advanced resilient microgrid technology provides continuous electric service to support critical services to people displaced during extreme disasters; and provides electric service to support recovery crews working to restore services. In an emergency, the microgrid is an electrical ""island"", idependent of the main power grid and serves these critical loads through local power generation. This project will focus on the human-machine operational impacts of the microgrid both during normal operations as well as during disaster response. The development of ""smart scheduler"" technology  will enable the microgrid  operator  and  the  local  disaster  response  team  to  maximize  the  microgrid's performance during the disaster recovery. The microgrid must operate successfully disconnected from the grid for two weeks or more in catastrophic situations where the level of damage is unanticipated and the microgrid itself has experienced reduced capability. Human-machine capability will be developed to respond to rapidly changing community needs with a minimum of human effort.<br/><br/>The project will complement ongoing projects to plan and design a resilient underground microgrid in Potsdam, New York. The Potsdam microgrid features a unique partnership of generator owners, local government, regulated utility, and critical load entities. This diverse set of microgrid partners is key to providing the resilience required of the microgrid. At the same time, designing, building, and operating the microgrid as a unit with its diverse set of owners presents a range of challenges. Developing the capability to schedule and control the microgrid in both normal and emergency events is a critical element of this project. Equally important is the development of a microgrid design that provides this service at a minimum cost, by maximizing the benefit of the microgrid assets during the normal operation.<br/><br/>The lead institution is Clarkson University (Coulter School of Engineering, School of Business, and School of Arts and Sciences). The primary industrial partner on the project is National Grid USA (Waltham, MA), the electric service provider for a large part of New York and New England, including Potsdam, NY. National Grid would own the underground distribution network  that  is  the  backbone  of  the  microgrid.  The  Electric  Power  Research Institute, Knoxville, TN, is the broader context partner on the project. In Potsdam, NY, Clarkson University, SUNY Potsdam, the Village of Potsdam, and Canton-Potsdam Hospital are among the entities that would participate in the microgrid and are potential generation owners on the microgrid."

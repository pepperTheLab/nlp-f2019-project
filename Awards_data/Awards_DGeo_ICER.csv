This project is a collaboration between an established data facility in the solid Earth sciences, IEDA (Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance), three scientifically related data communities in the solid Earth sciences that lack data facilities (deep seafloor processes, mineral physics, polar cryosphere), a research data collection (MetPetDB), a group of computer scientists that specialize in distributed information systems and interoperability, and a social scientist to re-structure the IEDA data facility, both organizationally and architecturally, to create the pilot of a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary alliance of data providers. The goal is to create a model for other data facilities to partner with so far ?underserved? data communities to broaden integration of Geoscience domains into EarthCube, and advance both interdisciplinary and discipline-specific data science, while realizing economies of scale by sharing common data services. <br/><br/>Using IEDA as a testbed, the project will adopt elements of three EarthCube technologies that have been or are being developed by EarthCube Building Block projects: CINERGI (Community INventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability), GeoWS (Geoscience Web Services), and GeoLink (Semantic Web technology), to build the architecture of the alliance, thereby testing, validating, and potentially improving these technologies. The technical work will focus on creating a flexible and scalable framework that will allow a growing number of partner systems to plug into shared capabilities such as applications for integrated data discovery and data submission and contribute their resources. Architectural changes at IEDA will go hand-in-hand with the transition of IEDA?s organizational structure toward the envisioned multi-institutional alliance."

These samples are fundamental references that are studied to generate new knowledge about the earth and the entire universe and a deeper understanding of the processes that created and shaped it, the availability of natural resources and the risk of natural hazards. Many samples have been collected at great cost and with substantial difficulty, are rare or unique and irreplaceable. The use of information technology and the internet to make these samples easily accessible, to ensure persistent access to relevant sample metadata, to allow unambiguous linking of the physical objects to the digital data in a distributed data infrastructure, will have a broad impact across the entire Earth Sciences. It will open new opportunities to reexamine existing samples in response to new societal issues, environmental concerns, scientific interpretations, and analytical techniques. The activities of this coordination network will allow domain scientists, curators, and computer and information scientists to learn from each other about the requirements of physical and digital sample and collection management and to articulate a vision of and a path forward toward an Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>The EarthCube Research Coordination Network iSamplES (Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences) is intended to advance the use of innovative cyberinfrastructure to connect physical samples and sample collections across the Earth Sciences with digital data infrastructures to revolutionize their utility for science. The ultimate goal of this RCN is to dramatically improve the discovery, access, sharing, analysis, and curation of physical samples and the data generated by their study for the benefit of science and society as part of the EarthCube program. In order to work toward this objective, the project will help build, grow, and foster domain scientists, curators of sample repositories and collections, computer and information scientists, software developers and technology innovators to engage in and collaborate on defining, articulating, and addressing the needs and challenges of physical samples as a critical component of digital data and information infrastructures (theme 1: socialization). The RCN will compile information about existing resources (technologies, architectures, tools, profiles, workflows) that facilitate the management of samples, sample collections, and sample-based data in the field, in the lab, in repositories, in data systems and scientific publications, and identify critical gaps and needs (theme 2: knowledge creation). The RCN will recognize and promote best practices and standards for sample identification, documentation, citation, curation, and sharing across the entire Earth Science community as a foundation to building a shared cyber-infrastructure (theme 3: best practices)."

This auxiliary information, known as ""metadata,"" is crucial to allowing scientists to understand the physical and derived quantities captured by the data.  The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for netCDF (netCDF-CF)  are currently used widely by weather forecasters, climate scientists, and remote-sensing researchers to include metadata along with scientific data, and numerous open source and commercial software tools have been developed to explore and analyze data sets that use the conventions. This project will work to extend the existing metadata conventions in ways that will broaden the range of  earth science domains whose data can be represented.  By broadening the applicability of an established convention, this effort seeks to extend its benefits to related earth science domains and reduce the amount of effort scientists must expend decoding and reformatting datasets created by other research groups. This, in turn, will leave researchers more time for analysis, leading to a better understanding of the physical processes the data describe.<br/><br/>NetCDF-CF is a community-developed standard first released in 2003. Originally designed to represent climate and forecast model output encoded in the netCDF binary format, with the specific goal of facilitating comparison of output from different models, the standard is now widely accepted in the climate, weather, and remote-sensing research communities, but less so in other earth science domains. This project will extend the standard to better represent a data set's spatial extents, and to encompass earth science data sets not currently covered by the conventions, including radar and more complex satellite data. Additionally, the project will work to make netCDF-CF compatible with data stored in modern data structures developed since the original creation of the conventions. Since netCDF-CF is a community-based standard, the approach will be to bring stakeholders from the existing CF community together with experts from domains into which CF can logically be extended so they can work together to design and prototype a series of enhancements, which will be submitted to the larger community for consideration. The envisioned improvements will help diverse research groups use the conventions to faithfully represent their data in formats accessible using standard, widely-available software tools.  This type of cross-domain data interoperability has the potential to give rise to more effective, integrated decisionmaking tools for a wide range of communities."

Yet ocean data is held in multiple data facilities, in different formats, and is accessible through different pathways. This creates practical problems with integrating and working across different data sets. The SeaView project is building connections between the rich data resources in five major oceanographic data facilities - R2R, BCO-DMO, CCHDO, OBIS and OOI* - and an ocean data visualization and exploration tool, the Ocean Data View (ODV), having over 40,000 registered users. To do so, it is leveraging from NSF investments into two previous EarthCube projects: CINERGI, as the registry where users will find and access data they wish to use, and GeoLink, which is providing interconnections between existing data resources, allowing users to explore a knowledge base of related information. SeaView leverages existing resources to provide improved tools and data access in support of fundamental research in two areas of ocean sciences: deep water hydrography and marine community-environment interactions. Both feed directly into research identified by the 2015 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences as of the highest priority. It will also engage scientists from currently underrepresented communities in EarthCube.<br/><br/>The specific oceanographic communities targeted are deep water hydrographers and marine ecologists, particularly those studying species interactions with the environment. Near the start of the project, a set of three focus groups and a Science Drivers workshop composed of end-user scientists from these communities will prioritize the specific datasets and develop science scenarios (use cases). They will meet again mid-stream for hands-on testing of the tool and feedback.  The CINERGI registry will be used to expose ODV-supported formats from these repositories to ODV. The EarthCube GeoLink knowledge base will provide links to additional content (investigators, publications, etc.) for cruise-related datasets loaded in ODV."

We propose to provide multiple opportunities for discover the geosciences to high school students so that they have a clear vision of what a geoscientist does and how this work can impact our local community, the nation, and the world. <br/>We propose three programs to expose more students to the geosciences including: i) Creating an engaging summer program for early high school students to focus on the role of geoscience in society; ii) Working with high-school science teachers in nearby school districts to invite students to participate in an open house visitation program where they can interact with geoscientists in research labs on campus; and, iii) Establishing a collaboration with NCSU programs working with high performing and/or uncommitted incoming students to develop and promote a Geo-Journey summer bridge course to be offered prior to first-year students arriving on campus. During all components of the project we will collect survey data that allows us to measure student interest regarding the geosciences and its potential as a career option. This data will allow us to interpret the relative effectiveness of these three strategies in increasing the number and diversity of students entering geoscience degree programs in North Carolina. <br/>The proposed project seeks to provide a mechanism for reaching a cohort of students who are currently unengaged with the geosciences in high school and do not consider the geosciences to represent a realistic career path. A second outcome of the project will be the production of a series of lessons that North Carolina high school teachers can use to customize instruction of essential geoscience concepts in earth and environmental science classes. Further, this project provides opportunities for geoscience faculty at NCSU to build robust partnerships with colleagues within university programs serving incoming students and with science teachers in the Wake County Public School System.<br/><br/>Part II<br/>The primary goal of GP-Impact: Expanding Geology Discovery Opportunities Beyond the Classroom is to increase the number of students interested in pursuing undergraduate degrees in geoscience through the design and testing of new approaches for engaging high school students in authentic, career-relevant experiences in geoscience. We propose a multi-dimensional plan for reaching out to new populations of students beginning soon after they enter high school and ending a few weeks before they take their first course on campus at North Carolina State University. We break this down to specific objectives associated with the three elements of the proposal. <br/>?? Objective 1 - Attract freshmen/sophomore high school students to a summer camp program focused on the idea that the geosciences represent an interesting and realistic career path. Summer camp programs geared toward high school students can involve students in some basic research during which they learn about the geosciences, work with geoscientists, and hear from working geoscientists about the nature of their jobs. Participation in these programs can develop an initial interest in the geosciences among high school students who may not have taken a related class.<br/>?? Objective 2 - Present junior/senior high school students with the variety of types of research that represent the geosciences and demonstrate to them how relevant the geosciences are for the future of Earth at a variety of scales. Most high school students have little conception of what a geoscientist does and few have ever met a geoscientist. Students will participate in lab visits with research faculty in geology, marine science, and meteorology so that they can realize the significant role that the geosciences play in identifying and mitigating the grand challenges that society will face during their lifetimes. These visits will build interest among the participating high school students that will result in increased applications to MEAS programs. <br/>?? Objective 3- Attract STEM-friendly students into the Geosciences through our new Colorado River GeoJourney course. We will teach a new hands-on geoscience summer bridge field course for matriculating first-year university students. This 3-credit course will focus on interactions between geoscience and society along one of the continent?fs most iconic rivers. Students will be recruited from university programs containing students with a STEM focus, but who may be unaware of the merits and opportunities of a career in the geosciences. A field course that is taught in a region of spectacular geology, and has an intentional focus on how geoscience is related to society, has the potential to convince some of the participating students that they should consider majoring in a geoscience program. We hypothesize that matriculating first-year college students who participate in the NCSU Colorado River GeoJourney are more likely to: 1) enroll in additional geoscience courses; and, 2) choose to major in the geosciences when compared against both their peer-population as well as in comparison to similar demographic cohorts prior to the implementation of the Colorado River GeoJourney.<br/>The proposed project seeks to both increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in the geosciences. During all components of the project we will seek to collect data that allows us to measure student/teacher interest and attitudes about geoscience and its potential as a career option. This will be in the form of pre/post surveys and/or performance measures. This data will allow us to interpret the relative effectiveness of these three strategies in increasing the number and diversity of students entering geoscience degree programs in North Carolina. These programs can have an additive effect. We anticipate that students who participate in multiple elements of the project will be more significantly impacted than students who complete just one element.  <br/><br/>One outcome of the project is to provide a mechanism for reaching a cohort of students who are currently unengaged with the geosciences in high school and do not consider the geosciences to represent a realistic career path. Further, this project provides opportunities for geoscience faculty at NCSU to build robust partnerships with colleagues within university programs serving incoming students and with science teachers in the Wake County Public School System."

The ice loss is due to changes in surface mass balance and ice sheet dynamics associated with rising air and ocean temperatures. The associated increasing freshwater discharge is impacting the regional ocean, including its ecosystems, and has the potential to impact the large-scale North Atlantic circulation. Thus, Greenland's changes are having far-reaching consequences for global societies, yet the mechanisms responsible for these changes are not well understood. Dynamic ice loss, in particular, was likely triggered by changes at the margins of marine-terminating glaciers, through ice/ocean/atmosphere processes that are either absent or poorly represented in climate, ice sheet and ocean models. The interaction of the ocean, the glaciers and atmosphere at Greenland?s margins is a new research frontier. The complex processes involved include the coupling of multiple components of the Earth system, the challenges of obtaining and integrating diverse data from this region, and of modeling such a complex system. These challenges make this a problem that can only be addressed by bringing together multiple disciplines, including data management, collaboratively exploring diverse approaches and working across national borders. This project establishes a network to help scientists working in this area to share their data and work collaboratively.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to substantially enhance multi-disciplinary activities and collaboration through the establishment of the GRISO (Greenland Ice Sheet Ocean) Science Network - an international, multidisciplinary, open network of scientists and cyberinfrastructure experts. Participants have a shared interested in advancing collective understanding of problems related to Greenland Ice Sheet change and its impact on regional and global climate. GRISO RCN activities will bring together scientists focused on all aspects of ice/ocean/atmosphere/climate data in Greenland and provide a framework for productive collaborative interaction. Specific objectives include two workshops, and a series of synthesis efforts. Additionally, a virtual data portal, leveraging existing infrastructure, will make interdisciplinary data submission and data availability easier and promote uniform and appropriate data management practices. The RCN builds on activities initiated by the former GRISO US CLIVAR Working Group and explicitly addresses priorities identified in a report from an international workshop held in 2013."

This data can be used to understand the changes in polar regions due to climate change and other processes. The potential of global socio-economic costs of these impacts make it an urgent priority to better understand polar systems. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie polar climate change and the links between polar and global climate systems requires a combination of field data, high-resolution observations from satellites, airborne imagery, and computer model outputs.  Computational approaches have the potential to support faster and more fine-grained integration and analysis of these and other data types, thus increasing the efficiency of analyzing and understanding the complex processes. This project will support advances in computing tools and techniques that will enable the Polar Sciences Community to address significant challenges, both in the short and long-term.<br/><br/>The impact of this project will be in the improvements in the ability to utilize advanced cyberinfrastructure and high-performance distributed computing to fundamentally alter the scale, sophistication and scope of polar science problems that will be addressed.  This project will not implement those changes but will identify and lay the groundwork for such impact across the Polar Sciences. The Project personnel will identify primary barriers to the uptake of high-performance and distributed computing and will help alleviate them through a combination of community based solutions and training.  The project will also produce a roadmap detailing a credible and effective way to meet the long-term computing challenges faced by the Polar Science community and possible plans to effectively address them.

Finding energy and mineral resources, protecting water quality, preparing for the impacts of a changing climate, and keeping citizens safe from hazards such as floods and earthquakes are essential to the nation?s quality of life. In order for young people to choose career paths in Earth Science, they need well-prepared teachers who reflect the ethnic, racial, and gender diversity of our nation. These teachers should be able to effectively convey both the important concepts in Earth Science, and how Earth scientists gather and interpret information. Our project tests the idea that the best way to engage children in the knowledge and practices of geoscientists is for their teachers to have direct experience with scientific research. <br/>This project will create a 10-week summer program in which 8 undergraduate students per year gain direct experience in conducting scientific research and in translating this research experience into classroom lessons. Students majoring in science or in K-12 education from Western Michigan University, Lake Michigan College, and Kalamazoo Valley Community College will gain experience in four interwoven components: (1) Learn Science ? a two-week introduction to surface water quality and lake systems, (2) Practice Science ? a six-week water quality investigation in a local urban lake, (3) Teach Science ? two weeks of teaching preparation and practice with master teachers, followed by two weeks of supervised teaching in a middle school summer camp, and (4) Think Science ?  ten weeks concurrent with other program components in which students learn about how Earth Science is practiced by scientists and how they might best teach these practices to children.<br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to better prepare a diverse future Earth Science workforce. We expect that participating undergraduates will go on to impact thousands of K-12 students during their teaching careers, contributing to the nation?s scientific literacy and inspiring some of these children to become Earth scientists.  Additionally, this project explicitly recruits students of color and women from all participating institutions as a means for increasing the diversity of the Earth Science education workforce.  Finally, if this project is highly effective in preparing future teachers, we intend to advocate for this model to be adopted across our university and across the country.  <br/><br/>PART 2<br/>As states in the U.S. adopt the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), or adopt NGSS-inspired state standards, Earth Science takes a more prominent role across K-12 grades. Diverse and well-prepared teachers become ever more critical to expanding participation in the geoscience workforce. The best way to engage children in the knowledge and practices of geoscientists is for teachers to self-identify as geoscientists, which can be achieved through authentic experiences with scientific practices such as asking questions, gathering and analyzing data, and justifying claims with evidence. <br/>This project will create a 10-week summer program in which elementary and secondary science education undergraduates from Western Michigan University and two regional community colleges gain direct experience in conducting scientific research and in translating this research into classroom lessons while being guided through reflection of the work. Cohorts of 8 students per year will gain experience in four interwoven components: (1) Learn Science ? a two-week introduction to surface water hydrogeology and lake systems, (2) Practice Science ? a six-week water quality investigation in a local urban lake, (3) Teach Science ? two weeks of mentored  teaching preparation and practice followed by a two-week mentored teaching experience as summer camp instructors, and (4) Think Science ?  ten weeks concurrent with other program components in which students learn about the nature of science and scientific inquiry, reflect on their research experiences, design lessons to be taught at the summer camp, and reflect on their teaching experience. <br/>Because authentic research, teaching, and reflection on Earth Science research and education will be coupled, the outcome of this program will be that elementary and secondary science teachers will self-identify as geoscientists just as strongly as they do as teachers. Through this integrated approach, we will improve future teachers? knowledge of content, skills, and scientific practices in surface water hydrogeology and geochemistry, improve their ability to design and carry out a field- and laboratory-based investigation, increase their understanding of the context of the scientific method, improve their skill in designing and teaching lessons to middle school students, and improve their knowledge of classroom practices of science and how to use these to inspire more young people into careers in earth and environmental science. Ongoing external evaluation will provide data informing the project team as to whether we are meeting program goals, and where the program may be improved. <br/>As they go on to a career in teaching K-12 science, each of the 24 undergraduate students expected to participate in this program will collectively impact thousands of children. By self-identifying as a scientist and displaying comfort with scientific thinking and experimentation, they will be able to make their own students more comfortable with science and hence increase the chances that they will consider scientific career paths thus enabling our program graduates to inspire future geoscientists. Discussion of careers in the geosciences and related fields will be an explicit part of this program. Additionally, this project explicitly recruits students of color and women from all participating institutions as a means for increasing the diversity of the Earth Science education workforce.  We anticipate that this program will also impact other pre-service teachers through interactions with peers. Finally, we will disseminate our program model and best practices as identified through evaluation so that key aspects can be adopted at other teacher preparation institutions."

Moreover, such observations are most powerful when many records are brought together to provide a spatial understanding of past variability. However, there is currently no universal way to share paleoclimate data between users or machines, hindering integration and synthesis. Large-scale, international, paleoclimate data syntheses have a long and successful history, but have been needlessly labor-intensive. Recognizing that (1) paleoclimate data curation requires expert knowledge; (2) top-down data management approaches are ineffectual; (3) existing infrastructure does not foster standardization; there emerges a critical need for a flexible platform enabling crowdsourced data curation and standards development.The platform will be combined with editorial and community-driven processes which will result in a system that has the potential to engage a broad user base in geoscientific data curation. The proposed framework will lower barriers to participation in the geosciences, enabling more ""dark data"" to join the public domain using community-sanctioned protocols. The pilot project will facilitate the work of hundreds of paleoclimate scientists, accelerating scientific discovery and the dissemination of its results to society.<br/><br/>Semantic wikis provide a simple, intuitive interface to semantic languages and infrastructure that build on open Web architecture. Like traditional wikis, they enable the collaborative authoring of content. Secure access and time-stamped content also enable the tracking of changes and the accountability of users, as well as moderation capabilities by community members of recognized expertise. In contrast to traditional wikis, semantic wikis allow contributors to assign meaning to their content, specifying relationships between the objects they describe. This enables artificial intelligence reasoners to parse, process and translate these data into more useful forms. The technology is well-proven, scalable, and completely transparent to the user, requiring no computer science knowledge or more sophisticated technology than a web browser. The LinkedEarth Wiki will automatically translate this information into Linked Open Data, a universal format to share data across the Web. To demonstrate this concept?s broad applicability across paleoclimate science, the project?s target community is the PAGES2k consortium, an international collaboration dedicated to the climate of the Common Era. Social technologies will be developed to power collective curation, standards development and quality control by the community itself. The project will demonstrate applicability to other paleogeosciences, serving as a potential template for other geoscientific disciplines."

According to the NSES 2015 statistics, Hispanics, African Americans, and American Indians or Alaska Natives are disproportionately represented in all STEM fields. The representation in geoscience fields, however, is the lowest of all surveyed disciplines. CLOSES-GAP is a comprehensive partnership between University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Delaware State University and Rutgers University Newark and a research university (University of New Hampshire) to enhance mechanisms to recruit under-represented students into the geosciences. Taken in concert, program elements allow CLOSES-GAP student participants to build skills important for graduate program matriculation and success. Additionally through this project the participating institutions will strengthen collaborative working relationships for engaging together in sustained research and student mentoring activities.<br/><br/>CLOSES-GAP is a comprehensive program consisting of several interconnected components that offer a suite of supports and opportunities. Specifically, students will be recruited during their junior year and receive research training and mentoring during the following summer and throughout their senior year. The organizers will address two major priorities of the GEOPATHS program by 1) offering students in biological oceanography, or other related non-geoscience programs, opportunities to explore research opportunities available in physical oceanography and near-shore geoscience; and 2) providing participants with foundational skills in basic geoscience research and science communication skills. The goal will be to provide CLOSES-GAP fellows with experiences that give insight into the diversity of research options in marine geosciences, and to provide research opportunities that leverage UNH's world-class ocean mapping facilities and personnel, including the residential facility at the Shoals Marine Laboratory, 6 miles off the coast of New Hampshire. Additional mini-courses, facilitated or created by the project team, will coach fellows on research skills, graduate admission and fellowship applications. Students will enter the program in the summer following their junior year, and be supported through the following academic year by pairs of advisors at both their home institution and UNH. Their participation will culminate in presenting their work at a national or regional science conference. Equally important to the summer research camp are the mentoring expertise and comfort that comes with familiarity of the fellows' home institutions. Before and after attending the UNH research camp, participants will complete online mini-courses in basic research skills such as statistical analysis, as well as often overlooked competencies such as data management and academic/research ethics. We will also focus on developing a ""research community"" in each participant cohort, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary research groups in contemporary geosciences and marine sciences. Upon returning to their home institutions after the research camp, the focus will shift to data analysis and communicating their findings to a variety of audiences, in a range of media - from traditional professional conferences and publications to social media. At the core of the program is a holistic approach to participant support that combines unique research opportunities with highly-supportive mentoring at both UNH and their home institution. The CLOSES-GAP program will strengthen an alliance between four institutions and will recruit 30 undergraduates from underrepresented groups to participate in a program focused on preparation for graduate school and, ultimately, careers in the geosciences.  Across the alliance, this program will also improve the capacity of geoscience faculty, and their respective departmental and institutional affiliations, to tailor recruitment approaches to non-majority audiences, and to support underrepresented students in successfully applying to graduate programs. In addition to these direct and immediate impacts, the CLOSES-GAP team will disseminate their findings to the larger geoscience community through traditional, academic means (publication and conference presentation), as well as through the creation of guiding resources for future partnerships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particular concern in this area is the export of excess nitrate from the use of fertilizers on lawns, which can promote algal or microbial growth in receiving waters. Recent research has indicated that such nitrate export is less than expected, but the reasons for this are unclear. This project will investigate both the natural processes that may regulate the retention and discharge of nitrogen from lawns, as well as the sociological forces that influence the decisions of homeowners concerning the level of lawn management. The results will be incorporated into a model that will identify the locations and episodes of high nitrate in runoff in order to determine how human decisions and natural processes work together to control these concentrations. The conclusions will be applicable to a wide variety of urban and suburban locations across the country and the project will have direct benefit to the management of the environmental health of Chesapeake Bay. <br/><br/>This project models multi-scale, coupled-system dynamics of nitrogen in residential landscapes to determine how biogeochemical, hydrologic, and human behavioral processes interact to control nitrogen exports from residential ecosystems and landscapes. These models will coordinate information from household surveys, existing data, and geographic information system analyses to evaluate interconnected spatial patterns of lawn management and hydrologic sensitivity. The overarching hypothesis is that large-scale social and institutional influences often induce homeowner lawn-care practices contrary to homeowner preferences, but that significant changes in behavior can be motivated via systematic incentives. Field studies on plots varying in land use history (forest versus agriculture), site management (fertilizer input) and age will be established to test hypotheses about the limits of nitrogen sequestration in lawn soil profiles. Geographic, biogeochemical, and social-science data will be analyzed using ecohydrological models to produce spatial analyses of potential hotspots of lawn fertilizer export at the watershed scale. The effect of alternative policies and homeowner practices on land management and nitrogen exports can then be evaluated rigorously."

Invited keynote speakers will frame the discussions and all participants will have a chance to contribute through breakout groups, interactive polling, and poster sessions.The writing group will summarize the discussions in a document addressing the two broad goals of the workshop: Goal 1: Work towards developing the framework for preservation of longitudinal seismic data. This includes recommendations for prioritizing scanning efforts, defining metadata and data imaging standards to improve discovery and (re)use, and identifying the associated technical and social challenges. Goal 2: Create an interdisciplinary network of data, domain, and computational scientists to facilitate management, access, and use of digitally imaged legacy data.<br/><br/>New seismological data mining methods are supporting discoveries and cross-disciplinary research across Earth system science. Such research is challenged by the relatively short time period of observation for which digital records are readily available. Historical data, recorded on paper and other physical media, potentially extend the time period of Earth observation to many decades. However, if such dark data are to be preserved and made available digitally to harness the data revolution, there are compelling challenges. The historical data are largely siloed; data are only available to scientists who can commit to traveling to specific archives or from archives capable of serving data requests. In addition, some of the physical media have been damaged or lost and/or at risk of losing stewardship. Hence, it is imperative that the community organize to preserve as well as make available these irreplaceable collections. The workshop will provide support for early-career and participants from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While information discovery portals and search engines have been developed for many data repositories, and systems that simultaneously search multiple resources have been created, cross-disciplinary data discovery remains a serious issue. It becomes especially acute with rapid increases in the volume and diversity of observations, reflecting different components of the Earth System and collected by multiple research groups, government organizations and commercial companies. The main goal of the EarthCube Data Discovery Hub project is to greatly reduce the time and effort necessary to locate and evaluate geoscience information resources across disciplines, and increase the value of investment in data generation by promoting data reuse and reducing duplication of effort. Project outcomes will benefit a wide group of scientists by providing them a user-friendly and powerful gateway to information resources across multiple data facilities and community contributions, and mechanisms for improving the system to answer their research queries in a consistent manner.

Four U.S. environmental observatories (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) and collectively EarthScope, comprising USArray and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), operated respectively by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) and UNAVCO) are working together with their respective counterparts from the European Union on developing common data policies and standards relevant to global research infrastructures in the environment field.   <br/><br/>The project goals include developing new understanding through broad harmonization of data and constructing multi- discipline, synergistic data products that have wider societal importance.  In addition, these activities will help the scientific community to better develop coupled models that better capture critical feedbacks and interactions of the earth system.  These models are needed to help make these types of data more accessible to decision-makers at many levels.  <br/><br/>Linking these existing programs provides a unique opportunity for early career researchers and students to learn in a multi-disciplinary environment and to benefit not only from the U.S. participants but also their European counterparts.

Earth observation data generated from space-based satellites or ground-based radar and radiometer facilities are typically time-varying, and multivariate, and can take tera- or even peta-bytes of space to preserve and process. The common practice is to choose and transfer subsets of data from multiple data archive servers to local machines and then conduct data analysis tasks. However, this approach becomes increasingly unsustainable with an exponential growth of observation data size. It becomes an increasing severe problem that scientists can gain detailed observation data but lack suitable and scalable analysis capabilities to study the full extent of data. The team will work closely to develop, evaluate,and deploy the computer infrastructure to improve the performance and scalability of geophysical analysis for scientific discovery and education. By making the system available to other researchers, it will facilitate the development of new scalable solutions.Interactive geosciences applications will be used as an effective means to promote students interest in science and engineering studies, and to attract and retain students for geosciences community growth.<br/><br/>This research develops new techniques in support of scalable geophysical analysis in a data-intensive environment. The innovation and the basis of our technique approach are to develop an optimal data layout algorithm for indexing and placing massive heterogeneous observation data across distributed devices of a cluster. The new data layout is tailored to the spatial-temporal characteristics of Earth observation data, and can directly account for advanced compute techniques, including non-volatile storage resources and GPU- and Manycore-based computing nodes, and support high-throughput and high-resolution exploration of large-scale data. The long-term goal is to study theory and technology that enable scalable data management and analysis for the geosciences community."

The researchers in this project are looking for short-term, near-term and long-term changes while researching new and evolving methods to observe properties and to process the collected observations.  Emerging technologies enable us to provide and discover the data openly and freely.  But, if we do not understand the newly discovered data, with its inherent limitations and biases, it cannot be responsibly utilized for new or collaborative research efforts.  Working with environmental sensor manufacturers and researchers, the X-DOMES project will develop tools and social and technical infrastructure to facilitate the creation of data about data (metadata).   Metadata describes not only who, when and where the observations were made, but also it must document how an observation came to be (provenance).  By taking this knowledge out of manuals and human-readable documents, the X-DOMES model creates metadata that can be treated like data ? discoverable and searchable, making it ready to be incorporated into automated archival and processing for quality assurance and validation methods. <br/><br/>Leveraging existing relationships with large NSF-funded data management programs, EarthCube building blocks and working groups, and environmental sensor manufacturers and consortia, we will establish a community of sensor manufacturers and other stakeholders to provide a unifying approach to describing sensors and observations across geo-science domains.  Built on an existing sensor metadata model that references registered, standards-based vocabularies, the X-DOMES pilot project will provide a suite of tools, built upon community-adopted standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to demonstrate and facilitate the generation of documents that are discoverable and accessible on-line and/or directly from onboard sensor descriptions.  The project will also demonstrate mechanisms to associate the data with the metadata through standards-based web services.

For understanding and predicting the complex and evolving Earth system, it is critical to investigate its coupling to the space environment and to solar variability. To facilitate interdisciplinary research on solar influences, PI and the team will develop a unique data environment that will integrate new and archived satellite and ground-based observational data. The integrated data environment will allow researchers to efficiently access solar and geospace data and use them for studying fundamental problems of solar activity and variability and their impacts on Earth systems, as well as for developing new predictive capabilities. The innovative interdisciplinary approach for building an intelligent integrated database, developed in collaboration between heliophysicists and computer scientists, will contribute to knowledge discovery in the EarthCube and associated fields.

The 6th GLOBE Learning Expedition (GLE) and the 22nd GLOBE Annual Meeting will be held in Killarney Ireland July 1-6, 2018. The theme of the GLE meeting is Connecting Mountain, Woods and Lake Biomes: Developing a Special Sense of Place for the GLOBE Community. The GLEs are organized every four or five years in order to provide students from around the world the opportunity to present their research projects to their peers, to GLOBE scientists, and to the wider GLOBE community. GLEs also provide students with the opportunity to participate in a collective place-based research experience, learn about each other's cultures, and to develop collaborative partnerships that will enhance their future GLOBE, academic and career experiences. The GLOBE Community consists of students, teachers and scientists in over 100 U.S. Partnerships and 100 Partner Countries. The GLOBE Implementation Office will arrange all the logistics. Over 250 adult participants and 150 students are expected to attend the week-long event.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Concerns over the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) graduates has been mounting for decades, and has risen to a new level with the publication of recent reports. These reports all point to the lack of qualified STEM graduates to meet short and long-term workforce needs of the nation's economy. The previous two federal administrations have touted the need for more emphasis on STEM education. In addition, GLOBE is an excellent vehicle for making connections between formal and informal environments (through public participation in science) and for creating and sustaining STEM interest in students in all levels of the educational system.<br/><br/>Specific objectives for this meeting include:<br/>1) Students share their learning/experiences related to GLOBE-based research to peers;<br/>2) Students participate in science and motivate each other through real-time interactions;<br/>3) Participants (scientists, teachers, Country Coordinators, US Partners) share experiences, collaborate in<br/>doing science and celebrate accomplishments;<br/>4) Participants learn more about GLOBE and how students from different backgrounds can contribute to<br/>science and understanding about our planet;<br/>5) Teachers and students share how GLOBE activities are being conducted in their schools; and<br/>6) Students collaborate with each other through using protocols to study the local environment during the<br/>GLOBE Games."

Such increased understanding of global change requires GeoSTEM knowledge and broad participation, inclusive of minority populations. With the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), more rigorous geoscience curricula requirements are forthcoming and better qualified and more effective Earth Science teachers are needed. This is especially essential for rural Alaska, where unemployment is high and where indigenous student populations have traditionally been underserved.  <br/><br/>This three-year project implements mentored teaching experiences in remote rural villages to increase the number of Earth Science teachers in Alaska and targets the overall interest in geoscience careers of undergraduate and pre-college students (K-12). The project's interdisciplinary team from the University of Alaska School of Education (UAF-SOE), the UAF College of Natural Science & Mathematics (CNSM), the University of Alaska Museum of the North (UAM), and the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) in collaboration with Alaska's rural school districts will create and evaluate a multilayered recruitment and training program to increase the number of qualified and effective GeoSTEM teachers who understand and embrace the powerful local contexts of Alaska's Arctic Native villages. Participants will increase their understandings about: (a) the interdisciplinary nature of GeoSTEM contents; (b) place-relevant and hands on geoscience teaching practices; and (c) careers in geosciences and teaching. <br/>The project objectives are:<br/>(1) Development of a multilayered, sustainable recruitment program with focus on diversity participation in geosciences.<br/>(2) Development and implementation of a university-based, 3 credit GeoSTEM course that count towards both, UAF undergraduate geoscience and education degrees.<br/>(3) Implementation of mentored Earth/geoscience teaching experiences for GeoSTEM participants in indigenous rural schools that includes pre-college career education for geosciences. <br/>(4) Research and evaluation of the effectiveness of the (a) multilayered recruitment approach, (b) the university-based GeoSTEM course, and (c) the mentored geoscience field teaching experiences in indigenous and remote villages. <br/><br/>While the focus of this project is on increasing the number of Earth Science teachers, pre-college K-12 students will also benefit. During the geoscience-teaching experiences in indigenous and remote Alaska villages, participants will engage pre-college high school students in geoscience projects, hands on data collection and geoscience career education. This project serves initially 20 pre-service teachers and creates mentored field experiences in 10 schools serving 95% Native students and impacting immediately more than 400 indigenous students. This approach helps to create a pipeline into geoscience careers for indigenous students.  The proposed project supports Earth science teacher recruitment, effectiveness, retention, and equity in access to education for indigenous and rural students."

These risks are rendered even more extreme, more complex, and more difficult to manage by global climate change. Effective preparation for and mitigation of natural hazards is not simply a problem for natural scientists and engineers, but also for social sciences, since hazards originate and occur in the interfaces between natural systems and societies. Research has demonstrated that better-educated societies with better-educated decision-makers are best equipped to prepare for, mitigate, and recover from natural disasters. While hazards-related public and professional education are common missions for many universities and colleges, the HazPM project will improve on this model by drawing on expertise from both the social and the natural sciences of hazards to design and implement an undergraduate workforce-training program that integrates both realms from start to finish. Our design plan is fully supported by current research and will result in an innovative, fully accessible, and rigorously tested undergraduate curriculum that will be implemented regionally and disseminated nationally. Through parallel collaboration with faculty at regional two-year colleges that serve major populations of Native American and Hispanic/Chicano/Latino students, the HazPM project team will also increase access and professional opportunities in the sciences for underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Description<br/><br/>The overall goal of the HazPM project is to better prepare undergraduate students in geoscience and many other relevant fields, such as engineering, planning, management, pre-law, and sustainability, for careers or post-graduate studies related to natural-hazards preparedness and mitigation. Drawing on a research-based design plan that integrates natural and social sciences and employs a nimble partnership of expert professionals and educators from industry, government agencies, and academia, we will develop and bring to fruition an innovative, sustainable, and readily transferable workforce-training program that will be implemented locally and disseminated nationally and globally to enable wider adoption. The primary deliverable will be an innovative, online-native, fully accessible, rigorously assessed, modular curriculum for an undergraduate certificate program. Collaboration with agency and industry professionals will ensure program validity and relevance to career opportunities. HazPM will also increase access and professional opportunities for underrepresented students (including Native American and Hispanic/Chicano/Latino students in the U. S. Southwest) by means of pedagogy that addresses the impacts of socioeconomic inequality on vulnerability to hazards in underserved communities; direct partnership with regional two-year colleges that serve significant numbers of underrepresented students; and collaboration with minority professional STEM organizations (e.g., SACNAS, AISES, NABG) in dissemination of products.<br/><br/>Drawing on the diverse collective expertise of the principal investigators and collaborators, the HazPM project will integrate geoscientific principles and current geospatial, remote sensing, and monitoring technologies with social science principles and practices to inculcate a far broader understanding of the human, scientific, and engineering dimensions of hazards in students. Full collaborative participation of agency and industry experts in curriculum planning, development, and evaluation will ensure the validity of the program. Formative and summative assessment will maintain academic rigor. <br/> <br/>Partnering with regional community colleges will allow for the recruitment of a diverse cadre of students who reflect the cultural and socioeconomic diversity of the Southwest, and who will apply their expertise where it is most needed, especially in underserved areas. Students will be able to enter the program at these partner institutions and transfer to ASU to complete their studies. Impacts of the program on diverse students will be tracked and measured by means of institutional demographic data. The undergraduate certificate program will be fully available and accessible online, and formalized in the academic programs at ASU and collaborating community colleges to ensure its sustainability. All HazPM curriculum resources and research findings will be broadly disseminated among the academic and professional communities by means of conference presentations, refereed publications in journals of education research and teaching practice, and web hosting with links to community digital libraries such as SERC, DLESE, and UCGIS. Adoption and implementation of the program resources by other institutions will be encouraged."

Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges.  These holistic approaches provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine changes in Arctic ecosystems that are currently experiencing dramatic change with immediate impacts on ecosystem services involving food production, climate regulation, natural resources, and cultural integrity. This research will integrate indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge scientific approaches to develop long-term profiles of changes in the distribution and abundance of key Arctic species over time. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, Canada, and Denmark as well as UNESCO.  This large international collaboration will help build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public data resource on Arctic systems that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. In addition to the development of new processes that will allow the recovery of ancient DNA from sediments and their integration with other data types, this project will develop ecological forecasting models that incorporate how the diversity of organisms in the Arctic has changed in the past and is likely to change in the future. Additional impacts include the integration of science and education and training students to be the next generation of international scholars. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet.  The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium that will develop ecological forecasting models that incorporate chemical, physical, and multi-taxa ecological data. The models will include input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including indigenous peoples. Goals of this project are to dramatically improve understanding how the diversity of organisms in the Arctic has changed over time and is likely to change in the future.  Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. The U.S. component of the work will generate records of the changing distribution and abundance of plants and animals across the Late Pleistocene and Holocene by isolating environmental DNA from long sediment cores collected from lakes across the circumpolar North. These data will be combined with that from international collaborators about changes in the distribution and abundance of species over time taken from records from local communities and indigenous peoples extending back generations. The full suite of information will be used to address: how the diversity of living organisms has changed over time at different locations in the Arctic; determine how different these changes have been across space and time; tease out what the ecological and anthropogenic drivers appear to be in changes in Arctic biodiversity; and figure out how to combine quantitative ecosystems measurements with anecdotal and recorded accounts from local communities who interact with the vegetation, climate, herbivory, and other anthropogenic influences. With this information, model-generated scenarios will be created that support sustainable ecosystem management in the face of accelerating socio-ecological transformations occurring throughout the circumpolar North.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each summer, a cohesive long-term cohort of high school juniors will begin an inquiry based geoscience camp at MSU.  The BEST camp will focus on developing the relationship between the student and local industry professionals, and learning how real geologists apply scientific concepts to their careers.  Field trips to active workplaces and laboratories will reinforce this link and provide additional exposure to the role of geoscientists in the real world.  Each member of the cohort will participate in a research project on water quality and environmental parameters in conjunction with the Red River Authority (RRA) and Texas Stream Team (TST).  The students will learn to take measurements from industry professionals, and their data will contribute to an ongoing research collaboration between MSU, RRA, and TST.  Each member of the cohort will be provided with an invitation to attend MSU as a geosciences major, and they will have the opportunity to continue their research as a part of their undergraduate experience.  More than 143,000 geoscientists are expected to retire in the next 10 years, and our project aims to train sufficient professionals to meet the demand in energy and hydrology workers across the United States. This project will allow students to explore new opportunities by working with professional geoscientists and engage with career-relevant, field-based research that will allow them to build a successful career. By generating career-relevant experiences in geoscience education, the BEST program works towards providing a brighter future for Earth-related fields that promote clean air and water, secure our energy future, and promote public understanding of science.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The BEST Program will establish a multi-year research collaboration among academia, industry, and government employees, which will engage geoscience professionals in the training of future geoscientists. <br/>The first component of the BEST Program is an inquiry-based residential geoscience camp each summer.

Despite this critical need, there is a deficit of students opting to pursue geoscience-related career paths.  The overarching goal of this project is to increase the number of students at Clemson University intending to pursue a geoscience-related career by providing opportunities for both Geology majors and non-majors to engage in career-relevant geoscience research.  The approach that is being taken focuses on accessing the affective domain of learning as a mechanism to increase student engagement with the geosciences, via student motivation, emotion, and connections to Earth.  Targeting non-geoscience majors in this project is an important goal as they represent a large population of students that are often exposed to the geosciences through service (e.g., general education) courses, but rarely have an opportunity to participate in field or research activities, both of which are well known to be important doorways to careers in geoscience.  This project enables thousands of students to be exposed to geoscience research and STEM communication, thereby making a significant impact on the development of the geoscience workforce in South Carolina.  A new Industrial Affiliates program further engages students with existing geoscience professionals to promote student selection of careers in geoscience-related areas.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the deficit in the geoscience workforce by creating a three tier extracurricular approach to gradually transform non-majors into geoscientists by leveraging the existing undergraduate research component of Clemson's Geology Bachelor's (BS) degree.  The first tier of engages non-major students enrolled in geoscience service courses in extracurricular inquiry-based thinking that draws on the research activities of Clemson's undergraduate geoscience majors.  Building on this effort, students recruited to the second tier of engagement take part in non-major oriented project-based learning activities that utilize a ""citizen science"" approach to data collection, geoscience problem solving with GIS, or geoscience communication and outreach.  Students transitioned into the third tier of the program take part in formal undergraduate geoscience research projects.  Investing in Clemson's current research program not only strengthens research experiences for current Geology majors, but also provides more diverse, engaging and interesting projects to attract non-majors.  For example, the project enables cutting-edge science questions to be addressed in areas ranging across the fields of climate change, water sustainability, geomechanics, and geochemistry.  The newly-developed Industrial Affiliates program further strengthens the outcomes of both this project and the undergraduate BS degree program through: professional lectures, co-mentoring of student projects and internships, and evaluation of student preparation for careers in the geosciences.   Building on the existing BS degree program also allows the project to leverage Clemson's geoscience majors as ambassadors to non-majors and geoscience professionals, thereby strengthening the overall geoscience community in South Carolina.  The activities in this project build on best-practices developed in the geoscience education literature and contribute to this body of research by studying how the affective domain of learning contributes to student motivation in pursuing a career in the geosciences."

The Institute has an evolving Science Agenda identifying particular areas for research that have been defined by the scientific community of the Americas. The Science Agenda is complementary to the research priorities of the US Global Change Research Program. <br/><br/>This grant supports the US contribution to the third round of the IAI Collaborative Research Program (CRN3). The program support 10-12 regional research networks addressing global change issues of regional relevance that advance the understanding of global change phenomena and their socio-economic impacts. All projects are highly interdisciplinary. Each network involves Principal Investigators and Co-Investigators from institutions in at least four IAI member countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela). The networks were selected on the basis of submitted proposals evaluated for technical merit using a peer-review system. Results from this research will be available to the US scientific community, as a condition of US funding, through an electronic data and information system. The IAI receives additional support for its activities from the other Parties. This additional support takes the form of direct contributions to the IAI Budget, in-kind contributions, or in-kind contribution pledges made at the time of proposal submission in the form of investigator salaries, ship-time, computer time, logistical support, etc. <br/><br/>The program is integrative, involving the natural and the social sciences in a collaborative way and seeking to provide sound scientific understanding of global change issues in support of sustainable development in the region. CRN3 promotes applied science with a focus on emerging issues and themes that have not been dealt with under previous IAI programs or that are not yet (fully) explored. The CRN program brings together multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers to carry out regional-level research projects that no one country or institution could carry out individually. The collective research capacity of the participating institutions is huge, making possible an entirely new structure for participation in multinational and multidisciplinary projects focused on global change. <br/><br/>The outcomes of the individual projects contribute to the development and strengthening of regional capacity to deal with global change. The program provides a scientific basis for documenting, understanding and projecting changes in the Earth system, and specifically to facilitate the full use of scientific information in policy and decision making. CRN3 includes a strong capacity building component in terms of graduate and post-graduate education and enhancement of institutional infrastructure, and also promotes the participation of scientists from countries with less developed global change research communities. The first and second rounds of CRN showed that the multinational component of the projects provides an excellent opportunity for dialogue and exchanges among top researchers, students, decision makers and institutions from across the Americas, which in many cases led to partnerships that lasted and evolved far beyond the end of the individual CRN1 and CRN2 projects. CRN3 also promotes partnerships with other regional and/or international projects and programs. Under the first rounds of CRN, those linkages were very effective not only in terms of coordination of associated efforts, but also as a medium to distribute the results of CRN science to a very broad audience. The synthesis of CRN3 will be done through a technical synthesis for the scientific community and a non-technical synthesis for policy and decisions makers. This second synthesis is part of the IAI's strategy of communicating scientific information, models, and conclusions to and among researchers, educators, students, resource and industrial managers, policy makers and the public."

As society faces a potential shortage of geoscientists, this project is broadening the participation in the discipline by recruiting a diverse population of future geoscientists from underrepresented groups, and by easing their transition from high school to college. Building a model for similar collaborations between geoscience departments and the growing number of STEM-focused early-college high schools such as the STEAM Academy is another goal of this project. Such schools have been demonstrated to provide superior academic preparation, leading to higher rates of college enrollment and graduation in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.  Because these schools primarily admit students through lotteries, their student population is diverse and contains groups frequently underrepresented in the geoscience discipline. Most STEM students choose their major while in high school or before and these schools specifically emphasize career paths in STEM. Currently, these schools focus on health sciences and engineering. Lack of exposure to the geosciences prior to the critical transition between high school and college is often cited as a reason for the low numbers of geoscience majors. By capitalizing on a pre-existing model of STEM recruitment, this project is testing  its application to the geosciences in both recruiting and retaining geoscience students.<br/><br/>This project is testing the hypothesis that earlier exposure to careers in the geoscience will increase the number of students recruited into the field, and that the students will be more diverse than current geoscience undergraduate demographics. Students are being given a three-part opportunity to transition towards a college degree and a career in the geosciences. All students in the STEAM Academy are participating in geoscience-focused problem-based learning units (Exposures) designed and taught in collaboration by faculty members of both EES and STEAM. These units are teaching geoscience content through building scientific thinking skills, while exposing students to potential jobs in the geosciences. Students who become interested in the geosciences then have an opportunity to participate in a semester-long Internship in EES laboratories during their sophomore year, followed by a transition into a ""Geoscience Career Pathway"" through coursework in EES on the UK campus during their junior and senior years, all while continuing a discipline-specific customized curriculum at the STEAM Academy. Using mixed-methods (pre- and post-testing and surveys using the Geoscience Concept Inventory), changes are being tracked in students' awareness of and attitudes towards careers in the geosciences, as well as changes in the students' understanding of basic geologic concepts as they progress through the three levels of the program. The project seeks to identify and address any obstacles that the students may be encountering.

The Yale Project on Climate Change concluded that the majority of Clark County residents, 70% of NV's population, has a poor understanding of climate change issues. Increasing student exposure to geoscience education and increasing the number of geoscience prepared graduates entering the workforce in NV and the U.S. is the primary program goal. Field-based, experiential learning and research experiences are two high-impact practices generating deeper learning and higher retention. The merit of the proposed project rests on integrating practices that increase student interest and engagement in geoscience-related degrees and careers. The GeoGateway Program (GGP) has the broadest impact in increasing introductory students' scientific literacy and access to geoscience education through lesson plans based in real-world environmental change data and other experiential, field-based opportunities.  The number of students transferring from the College of Southern Nevada (CSN), NV's largest community college will increase because the colleges' articulation agreement includes mentoring and enhanced advising for students majoring in Environmental and Resource Sciences (ERS), a major including high geoscience content.  Gender demographics at both colleges demonstrate growing numbers of underrepresented minority females, especially Hispanic females, entering science fields. Students majoring in ERS will complete a significant research project or internship in collaboration with the Desert Research Institute (DRI), a specialized environmental research arm of the Nevada System of Higher Education, or other local organizations to further scientific knowledge of living sustainably in the dry southwestern U.S. This knowledge is critical for the communities in the region because as millions relocated here, climate change exacerbated the severity of droughts, fires, and other arid climates features. GGP graduates will be job-ready for geoscience jobs or to enroll in related graduate programs created to support state and national geoscience goals.<br/><br/>The GeoGateway Program (GGP), a structured pathway linking academic and research institutions in southern NV to train the region's new generation of geoscientists, will recruit and engage students taking geoscience-related coursework. Two-year Associate of Science (AS) graduates will channel into NSC's four-year ERS program. The GGP leverages commitments and staff from CSN and the DRI by accessing infrastructure already supported by NSF, the Nevada Climate-ecohydrology Assessment Network (NevCAN). Within four years, the GGP will reach more than 530 CSN and 680 NSC students through jointly-programmed introductory curriculum, guest lectures, field trips, and film screenings designed to generate 25% growth in ERS majors and a 25% increase in ERS graduates. CSN students graduating with an AS degree will directly transfer all relevant coursework into the NSC ERS degree, enter the GGP and participate in a Special Topics research project, receiving critical supplemental advising and mentorship from faculty and a near-peer GGP Ambassador. The large pool of potential undeclared NSC ERS majors will be recruited into ERS. By the end of the GGP, program partners will have strengthened the community college pipeline into a four-year degree program to help meet the nation's need for geoscientists. Other outcomes include the effectiveness assessment of the jointly-coordinated programming and participation in research or internships, by measuring geoscience knowledge gained and level of participant interest in pursuing geoscience-related degrees/careers, and the impacts of increased faculty advising and use of peer mentors, especially on recruiting and retaining underrepresented minorities and female students in science programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geoscience problems are complex and often involve data that changes across space and time. Frequently geoscience knowledge and understanding provides valuable information and insight for problems related to energy, water, climate, agriculture, mineral resources, and our understanding of how the Earth evolves through time. Simultaneously, many grand challenges in the geosciences cannot be addressed without the aid of computational support and innovations. Intelligent and Information Systems (IS) research in computer science includes a broad range of topics and computational methods such as knowledge representation, information integration, machine learning, robotics, adaptive sensors, and intelligent interfaces. IS research has an important role to play in accelerating the speed of scientific discovery in geosciences and thus in solving challenges that cannot be addressed by other means. Similarly, many aspects of Geosciences (GEO) research pose novel large-scale problems for IS researchers to improve and validate their methods. Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO) represent an emerging community of interdisciplinary researchers producing fundamental new capabilities for understanding Earth systems and how the application of IS technologies can cultivate key new developments in both fields.<br/><br/>The EarthCube Research Coordination Network for Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO RCN) will catalyze collaborations to enable advances in our understanding of Earth systems through innovative applications of intelligent and information systems to fundamental geosciences problems. The goal of the IS-GEO RCN is to leverage expertise and generate interactions between both the geosciences and computing sciences communities to provide advanced scientific capabilities. To enable the network, the IS-GEO RCN will host meetings and other activities that: (1) foster an active and broad-based community across GEO and IIS areas; (2) identify barriers to research, such as terminology differences among the disciplines involved and highlight knowledge gaps that hinder collaboration across the disciplines; (3) establish and enhance communication channels between GEO and IS researchers; (4) defining grand challenges in geosciences that are well suited to IS techniques; and (5) encourage robust, long-term collaborations.  Furthermore, the educational component aims to identify new approaches to teaching students in this new interdisciplinary area, seeking to raise a new generation of scientists that are better able to apply IS methods and tools to geoscience challenges of the future. By providing avenues for IS and GEO researchers to work together the IS-GEO RCN will serve as both a point of contact, as well as an avenue for educational outreach across the disciplines for the nascent community of research and practice.<br/> <br/>The initial efforts are focused on connecting the communities in ways that help researchers understand opportunities and challenges that can benefit from IS-GEO collaborations. The uncertain, heterogeneous and disparate nature of geoscience data paired with recent IS advances and increases in observational data offer unique opportunities for new approaches and discoveries through joint efforts. The IS-GEO RCN will jumpstart interdisciplinary research collaborations in this emerging new area so that progress across both disciplines can be accelerated."

More broadly, the GLOBE Program strives to expand the pipeline of future scientists and STEM professionals for industry, academia, and government as well as to engage citizens in collecting data about their local environment.<br/>The theme of the 23rd GLOBE Annual Meeting is Intersections of Diverse Environments. The location for the Annual Meeting, Detroit, Michigan, is positioned at the intersection of multiple types of diverse environments culturally, geographically, and economically. The municipality of Detroit, the largest town on the US-Canadian border, has a population of over 670,000 people and the metropolitan area is home to close to 6 million people. Within the urban downtown of Detroit is Belle Isle, a 982-acre island park in the Detroit River between Michigan and Ontario. Belle Isle includes an aquarium, conservatory, nature center, and natural areas to explore and discover (about 1/3 of the island is natural woodlands). The island, which is accessible by car and bus, is home to many types of small animals, birds, and insects. Protocol trainings will allow Annual Meeting participants to visit Belle Isle.<br/><br/>At the Annual Meeting, the theme of Intersections of Diverse Environments will be explored further in multiple strands. These strands are: 1) Finding nature in urban landscapes; 2) Exploring changing environments, 3) GLOBE and technology, and 4) GLOBE gives back. GLOBE community members will be invited to propose talks based upon the themes. Additionally, trainings will be offered by NASA SciAct Earth Science Education awardees (GLOBE Mission EARTH, The AREN Project, Arctic and Earth SIGNs, and the NASA Earth Science Education Collaborative (NESEC)). Woven through all the strands will be the overarching theme of inclusion and diversity. All presenters will be asked to think about equity and inclusiveness for their talks, panels, and demonstrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases the data needed to answer these questions already exists but, unfortunately, technology has not kept pace with research needs. This places increasing demands on researchers, who have to search for and download data from multiple separate online databases; compile published information from many different literature sources; and track down specimens housed in museum and other collections scattered around the world. The time needed to search and retrieve this information is enormous and, once found, the data often have to be standardized before they can be used. This project will tackle this problem by developing software tools to connect three established, well-supported, and critically important data sources: the Paleobiology Database (PBDB, paleontological, literature based), iDigPaleo (paleontological, specimen based) and iDigBio (neontological, specimen based). This project will allow users of any one of these databases to access and query the others at the same time, returning a much richer, combined set of data to the user. Connecting these resources will open up a whole host of research questions that are currently difficult to answer, even by multiple researchers working as a team. The development of this system will allow scientists to ask and answer new research questions affecting fields as diverse as biogeographic/niche modeling, systematics, functional morphology, evolutionary biology, ecology, climatology, conservation biology, oceanography, and petroleum geology. This project will fundamentally change the nature of the research questions that can be addressed by the scientific community.<br/><br/>The connectivity between modern and fossil, and specimen and literature-based resources does not currently exist.  The digital infrastructure provided by the composite ePANDDA application programming interfaces (APIs) will streamline and normalize data acquisition, including retrieval from disparate data sources, and will facilitate coordination with future data initiatives. Rather than creating another portal for the aggregation of data, ePANDDA will unify results that normally would have required multiple searches on numerous platforms. For the researcher, this eliminates a significant barrier to data collection and processing. Researchers will now have the ability to collaborate across disciplinary boundaries to study earth system processes and the nature of biotic response to environmental change across both space and time. Linking publications to specimens will enrich the potential of museum collections and augment their value for both research and education. The ePANDDA project also provides an opportunity to build collaborative programs that leverage existing education and outreach activities in addition to the primary research goals."

The core team includes natural and social scientists from Canada, China, France, Norway, Russia and the United States who will integrate document collections, geospatial data and stakeholder perspectives. This integrated decision-support tool will involve users in the co-design and co-production of options for both policy and built elements that are needed together for sustainable infrastructure development in the Arctic Ocean. A unique observational contribution from Pan-Arctic Options will be the analysis of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data of ship traffic across the Arctic Ocean collected from polar-orbiting satellites from 2009 forward. Results will be disseminated via journals (e.g., Science, Nature) and books as well as less-conventional methods involving facilitated dialogues in annual venues (e.g., Arctic Frontiers, Arctic Circle) and in the 2016 Arctic Expedition Summit involving the National Geographic Society and Google Ocean program. Management of this holistic project will be in the hands of a Steering Committee and an international Advisory Board involving global thought leaders and organizations (e.g., Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme), contributing to Arctic Ocean sustainability on a pan-Arctic scale."

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment related to the geoscience workforce is expected to grow at a faster rate of change on average than other fields over the next decade.  Coupled with the looming wave of retirements anticipated within the aging ""baby boomer"" population, a shortage of ~135,000 geoscientists is forecast within the next several years, particularly within the federal and state agencies that oversee natural resources management and the oil and gas industries. A major challenge to recruiting and preparing students to become the next generation of geoscientists is the general lack of awareness of education and career opportunities in the geosciences, especially among underrepresented minority students and students in underserved communities.  Because the geosciences are not often a required part of the high school or undergraduate curriculum, innovative approaches are needed to engage students at critical junctures in their education pathway (e.g., between high school and college).  Engaging students in authentic research-based experiences in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines has been shown to be an effective approach to recruiting and retaining students in STEM and the geosciences.<br/><br/>This collaborative project leverages resources at four NOAA-sponsored geoscience Cooperative Science Centers (CSCs), located at minority-serving institutions (University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Howard University, Florida A&M University, City College at City University of New York), and the Woods Hole Consortium of Institutions. The project has five major components: outreach to high schools regarding education and career opportunities in the geosciences; a 6-week summer bridge program for select high school graduates who have been admitted to one of the CSC institutions; a 10-week summer mentored research program in the second year for a sub-set of the summer bridge program students; and, virtual interaction between the summer bridge program participants and the research interns. Academic year support is also provided to the participants through existing NOAA-supported programs at the CSC institutions.  Through the CSCs' outreach program, geoscience recruitment materials are being disseminated to high school science teachers and counselors.  Nine high school seniors admitted to and preparing to enter college are recruited into the program each year. During the 6-week summer bridge program, these students receive education in the geosciences via lectures and hands-on lab and field activities. Field trips foster cohesion among the cohort of students, while providing an educationally enriching experience. Lectures and tutorials in math are strengthening the interns' quantitative skills, and enrollment in a freshman seminar course is facilitating their adjustments to college life. Participants in the bridge program then have an opportunity to participate in the 10-week summer Woods Hole Partnership Education Program (PEP) during the following summer.  The PEP program provides intensive mentored research, a credit-bearing course and supplemental career and professional development activities. Students are working in various research areas of the geosciences in collaboration with the WHOI Consortium of Institutions. Five to 9 undergraduate students are selected each year from the four CSCs to participate in PEP, where they participate in workshops to teach them how to design field and lab research projects, collect and analyze data, and effectively present their results orally, in poster form, and in writing. Through tracking and monitoring, students participating in this project are supported at key transitional educational junctures. This experience will accelerate their preparation for graduate level work and result in a diverse and competent workforce in STEM, particularly in the geosciences. By the end of the 3-year grant, a total of 32 students will have participated in the program, and more than 500 high school juniors and seniors nation-wide will have been reached with geoscience career information through their teachers and counsellors."

UT geoscience faculty are partnering with geoscience faculty at Pellissippi State, Roane State, and Volunteer State Community Colleges in east and middle Tennessee to offer enrichment activities, including outdoor experiential learning and collaborative research that will boost interest in the geosciences as a major and a career.  Enrichment activities include students and faculty from both types of institutions, along with recent geoscience graduates from UT.  These activities are helping community college students develop support networks that can reduce the social barriers that are often encountered when transferring to a large state university. Faculty mentors at UT are advising community college students on transfer courses and connecting them with research and internship opportunities. This project is expected to lead to greater diversity in student populations in 4-year geoscience programs at UT because of the more diverse student body found at the partner community colleges. The colleges typically have higher percentages of first-generation college students, rural students, and African-American students than UT. The project may also lead to greater career success and economic benefits for transfer students, because of the strong demand for professional geoscientists and the relatively high salaries offered for these positions.  The project is expected to serve as a model for other partnerships between major research universities and community colleges; lessons learned are being shared widely to encourage and strengthen similar partnerships at other institutions and in other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.  <br/><br/>The goals of this model partnership are to: a) increase the number of community college students transferring to geoscience programs (Geology and Physical Geography) at UT; b) improve the rate of success of transfer students at UT, by getting them excited about geoscience education and careers, and providing a higher level of university mentoring prior to their transfer; and c) increase diversity in the 4-year geoscience programs at UT, through effective recruiting from the more diverse pools of students that attend area community colleges. UT faculty are working with their community college partners to recruit students from introductory geology courses during their freshman year. Approximately 15 community college students and 5 UT students are invited to participate with faculty from the partner institutions in a 5-day residential field geoscience workshop at the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont each summer. The workshop includes experiential learning activities on geoscience topics that are expected to resonate with freshman students, including water quality, fossils, landslides, meteorology, and climate change. Students who are engaged in the summer workshops are invited to participate in additional enrichment activities during their sophomore year. These include field trips to geologically significant sites in the region and visits to UT, where community college students have opportunities to meet peers, tour research labs, and be assigned a faculty mentor.  Mentors provide information on course transfers, scholarships, and career prospects, as well as help arrange research or internship opportunities at UT, at the community colleges, or at other locations, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Through this project, the community colleges are receiving enrichment funds and access to UT labs and equipment for collaborative student research. UT and community college faculty are also working with administrators to improve transfer procedures and methods of tracking success of community college transfer students. The project coincides with ongoing efforts at UT to improve institutional data on metrics of success for transfer students. Faculty participants are guiding this effort to ensure that aggregated institutional data are collected and presented in formats that can be used by departments in planning revisions of curricula and in developing more effective mentoring methods. The efforts to improve the procedures for transfer students, together with the personal and professional ties that are expected to develop between UT and community college faculty members, will ensure that the impact of the project extends beyond the duration of funding and leads to enduring institutional change. Evaluation activities will help build the evidence base regarding what practices are most effective for developing partnerships to improve community college student recruitment, transfer and success in 4-year geoscience programs."

Understanding the impacts of global climate change and mitigating its effects will require the concerted effort of geoscientists.  At the same time, our country faces a critical need for people with training in the geosciences to fulfill employers? need for qualified personnel.  The difficulties developing our nation?s geoscience workforce starts early, as most college students are unfamiliar with the various academic disciplines that are a part of the geosciences and the career possibilities for those with training in the geosciences.  Consequently, very few students begin college with an intention to pursue a degree or career in the geosciences.  This proposal expands and develops the pool of students pursuing careers in geosciences by providing mentored research experiences in the geosciences at the critical junction when students are most likely to be deciding their career trajectory.  By providing students at a two-year college the opportunity to receive mentorship from scientists at four-year universities and federal agencies, this program develops the STEM workforce through enhanced education in traditionally underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>Technical<br/>Mentored research opportunities are a proven means to recruit, retain, and advance students in STEM fields, including the diverse disciplines that make up the geosciences, and mentored research therefore provides an exemplary model for developing the next generation of geoscientists.  This mentored research program, called the Undergraduate Coral Research Initiative (UCRI), builds upon the recent discovery by USGS scientists of a unique coral refuge from global warming among the shaded mangrove prop roots in Hurricane Hole, within the US Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument Marine Reserve.  Over the course of three years, at least fifteen students will be guided through all phases of the research process, beginning with developing science literacy skills (Phase I), followed by practical research skills in experimental design, data collection in a marine context, data analysis, and presentation of research findings (Phase II).  Students will play a central role in designing and executing experiments to address the biotic and abiotic factors that promote coral survivorship in some, but not all, parts of this mangrove habitat.  Because coral reefs are a keystone component of marine ecosystems, the work conducted by students will contribute to our understanding of, and ability to protect, coral from the stresses induced by global warming.  Finally, students will be provided a broader perspective of careers in geosciences through geology field skills training with students and faculty at a four-year university (Phase III)."

However, learning in the field is not entirely accessible for students with physical disabilities. This collaborative project will engage students with disabilities (SWD) in authentic field experiences via a peer instruction approach that pairs SWD with more physically capable students in collaborative field-based exercises. The overarching philosophy is that partnerships of students with diverse physical abilities, as well as student-instructor pairs, constitute a collective set of human senses and perspectives that can be as effective as individuals with no physical limitations. Outcomes from this work should apply to a wide variety of barriers to onsite field investigations that SWD and others may face during the course of their geoscience careers. This work is anticipated to increase the probability of retaining and graduating geoscience SWD and other collaborating students, and encourage and empower them to pursue geoscience careers, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.<br/><br/>Investigators at James Madison University (JMU) are collaborating with colleagues at the University of Cinncinatti, Old Dominion University, and Central Connecticut State University to pilot and test innovative approaches for enabling SWD to gain meaningful exposure to field-based activities relevant to the geosciences.  The project is designed to work with two cohorts of undergraduate geoscience students: one with mobility disabilities (SWD) and another without. Students (primarily sophomores) are being recruited from a national pool of undergraduate geoscience majors.  Students from each cohort are paired in a variety of field experiences, and collaborate both on-site in the field and through remote connections. Field data collection and analyses occurs in real-time via web-linked tablets and other interactive mobile devices. Real-time video and audio communication, both student-student and student-faculty, are facilitated through cutting-edge wearable technologies. The field program incorporates a range of experiences that are traditionally included within an undergraduate geoscience curriculum. These include: day-long field trips that focus on a specific set of field skills, such as generating strip logs for stratigraphic analyses; measuring structural orientations using a geologic compass; and, mineralogical and petrologic analyses using a hand lens. Field experiences in the second year of the project are focused on more advanced, multi-day exercises that require student teams to synthesize geologic field data collected into maps and reports that summarize the tectonic history of a region. Assessment of project activities by an external evaluator is being used to inform continuous improvements to the project design; summative evaluation and synthesis of the impacts of the project are expected to contribute to the evidence base regarding best practices for working with SWD in field settings.  Results and experiences from this project are being disseminated via presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and a capstone field trip for geoscience students, faculty, and professionals."

However, because PHS programs seek to influence both human behavior and the environment, they are extremely complex, and the scientific understanding needed to maximize their effectiveness is lacking. The goal of this project is to analyze the interacting social, economic, ecological, hydrological and policy impacts of Mexico's PHS programs, which have been operating for over a decade and thus represent some of the longest running programs of their kind in the world. The project will focus on two types of PHS programs operating within the Pixquiac and Gavilanes watersheds near Xalapa and Coatepec, Veracruz: 1) the ""national"" program, which is centrally organized and administered by the Mexican government, and 2) the local ""matching"" program, which requires greater involvement of diverse local institutions in the financing, planning, and execution of the program.  Impacts of the PHS programs on water and other (e.g., biodiversity, carbon) ecosystem services will be assessed using a combination of field data collection and modeling.  Interviews and surveys will be used to assess the influence of the two PHS programs (national and local) on people's decisions, as well as interactions with other social qualities such as perceptions of equity and well-being, health, income opportunities, and social organization. The information collected for the human and natural systems will be integrated through the application of spatial mapping tools, watershed modeling, and participatory workshops involving multiple actors in order to identify the key factors that determine the long-term success and cost-benefit trade-offs of PHS programs. This integrated approach will also be used to test the effects of different PHS policy and land use change scenarios on ecosystem services and long-term watershed sustainability.  <br/><br/>This project will contribute significantly to enhancing society's ability to protect water resources by developing an interdisciplinary approach for understanding how PHS policies both shape - and are shaped by - the coupled human and natural systems they seek to influence. Additionally, an important aspect of this research is that it will advance the current level of knowledge about PHS programs to encompass the larger concept of watershed sustainability, which to date has not been an integral component of PHS yet is crucial to protecting water resources. Results will be integrated into two science-based decision support tools that can be used by landowners and decision makers achieve desired watershed management and policy goals while avoiding unintended consequences: an aggregate sustainability index that provides concise information on watershed health, and a GIS-based mapping framework that spatially integrates impacts of land use change on ecosystem services and their relationship with coupled human and natural systems. Given that PHS programs are rapidly becoming an important policy mechanism worldwide for addressing critical environmental issues related to water supply and quality, the findings from this research will have broad impacts by helping to guide the design of more effective PHS policies across the globe.  To ensure successful local and global application of this research, findings will be widely disseminated through diverse portals, including policy forums, news media, interdisciplinary and disciplinary scientific journals, an edited book volume on global PHS programs, and a series of educational modules and seminars developed for both the middle school and university levels.  Finally, this project will train and mentor one postdoctoral research associate, four graduate students, and several undergraduate students, all of whom will gain valuable skills in interdisciplinary thinking and analysis and sustainability science within the context water resource management."

Within the geosciences, it is projected that there will be ~135,000 positions to fill in the next decade (AGI, 2014), greatly exceeding the number of available students earning advanced degrees in the geosciences.  Resolving the severe shortage in the geosciences workforce is projected to require increased participation in the geosciences by underrepresented minorities (URM), which is currently well below that of other STEM disciplines. Low URM participation in the geosciences is a particularly acute problem at The University of Michigan (U-M), where the number of undergraduate URM students majoring in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences is approximately 5% of total majors.  This is an important societal issue both from the practical standpoint of the geosciences workforce as well as ethical and sociological standpoints regarding the inherent value of diversity.  This project aims to increase the proportion of URM students majoring in geosciences at U-M to a level that reflects the overall demographics of the state of Michigan.  This will achieve the desired societal outcomes by (1) increasing the number of URM students trained in one of the nation's premiere geosciences departments at a flagship public university, and (2) advancing and disseminating knowledge on best practices for recruiting and retaining URM students in the geosciences.    <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to substantially increase the number and success rate of URM students majoring in the geosciences at U-M.  Although there are numerous activities already in place at U-M for recruiting and retaining diverse students in STEM disciplines, their focus is on engineering and biology, and only a few are applied to the geosciences. Further, these activities are currently disjointed, so there is no integrated mechanism for attracting and retaining URM students to pursue geosciences at U-M.  The proposed project will build on these current, proven programs and create partnerships between organizations to support URM students at two critical junctures: between high school and 4-year institution geoscience degree programs, and between community college and 4-year institution geoscience degree programs.  Five objectives will be pursued: (1) inspire and recruit high schools seniors to pursue geoscience at U-M; (2) establish infrastructure to support students interested in geosciences through the critical juncture between high school and college; (3) increase the number of URM students transferring from community colleges to U-M to study geosciences; (4) develop student interest in geosciences through research and field experiences; and (5) expose students to career opportunities in the geosciences.  These objectives will be achieved through the development and implementation of new hands-on experiences in the classroom, lab, and field; a summer program to bridge high school and college for students interested in geosciences; social media and peer-mentoring activities designed to establish supportive student cohorts; application to the geosciences of established practices for recruiting students and facilitating transfer from community college; and development of media and interactions with professional geoscientists designed to highlight career opportunities.<br/>   <br/>This project will link the proposed activities together with existing and developing programs at U-M, all of which employ evidence-based methods.  A novel aspect is that it will create a seamless and continuous pipeline for URM geosciences students from high school through the undergraduate years. Outcomes of this project will provide new perspectives on the importance of such an integrated approach to increasing diversity in the STEM fields.  Quantitative comparisons of performance of students within the newly developed program to those not involved in the program, and those involved in other programs and in other STEM fields, will be conducted via an innovative University-wide data mining process. We will also assess student attitudes towards the various phases of the project with online surveys and face-to-face interviews.

Eleven students will be recruited each year to participate in the structured geoscience workforce model program that consists of geoscience - Exposure, Preparation, Apprenticeship, and Experience. The initiative will bring together City Tech, Medgar Evers College and federal, local, and private geoscience industry partners that include: NYC Department of Environmental Protection, NYC Department of Transportation, NYC Emergency Management, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Cary Institute, and Partner Engineering and Science. City Tech and its partners will collaborate to achieve the following objectives: 1) create pathways for non-geoscience STEM majors to pursue careers in the geosciences; 2) provide hands-on geoscience training via the use of geoscience instrumentation, models, and data sets; and 3) engage students in transformative geoscience internship programs. The proposed activities combine year-long geoscience workforce experiences with multi-tiered mentoring, industry support systems, and a robust geoscience networking community to produce holistic and engaging stimuli for the workforce development of the participants. The scientific, educational, and geoscience workforce value of this project derives from two main sources: 1) a focus on the transfer of learning from STEM knowledge to real-world geoscience problems, operations, and workforce development, and 2) the expertise of geoscience practitioners at federal, local, and private facilities, all of whom are highly trained geoscience professionals.<br/><br/>This project at the New York City College of Technology (City Tech) seeks to expand and to sustain a year-round geoscience workforce preparation and geoscience career mentoring program for non-geoscience minority STEM students beginning at the critical juncture of their junior or senior year.

These institutions train a subset of those students as geoscience majors (~70 URI majors presently) for societally important positions in education, industry, federal agencies, conservation organizations, and more. The American Geosciences Institute 2014 Workforce Report predicts a workforce shortage of 135,000 geoscientists by 2022. This imminent need for well-prepared geoscientists must be answered by the engagement of academic geoscience departments. The intellectual merit of this project is multi-layered. A tractable set of changes is being implemented in Rhode Island public institutions of higher education to yield measurable outcomes, in terms of increases in the number and diversity of geoscience majors. A variety of experiences are being integrated into and scaffolded with the undergradute curriculum that are based on research-identified recommendations and strategies to reduce barriers for becoming and remaining a geoscience major. The relative importance of each factor for increasing student involvement and greater diversity in the geosciences is being evaluated, with specific attention to the case of 2YC-4YC geoscience transfer students. In this way, future activities (in Rhode Island and elsewhere) can focus policies and resources on what will make the largest difference in student decisions to become and remain geoscientists. Overall, this project seeks to promote science and advance national prosperity by strengthening the geoscience workforce, both through direct engagement with students and sharing of successful strategies with other organizations and institutions of higher learning.<br/><br/>Recognizing the growing importance of two-year colleges (2YCs) as the starting point for students who earn bachelor's degrees at 4-year institutions (4YCs), CCRI and URI are implementing a number of modifications and new programs that are aimed at increasing the number and diversity of geoscientists in each institution's programs. The goals of this program are to: (1) improve the 2YC/4YC transfer rate in the geosciences in Rhode Island; (2) increase the number and diversity of geoscience graduates; (3) enhance student training in geoscience and STEM-related fields; and, (4) contribute to the evidence base of successful practices in geoscience education. In this collaboration, CCRI and URI are putting in place both on- and off-campus components, including: targeted improvements to the gateway course to the major; systematic enhancements of the undergraduate curriculum in terms of data-rich activities, collaborative learning, and field experiences; streamlining of the transfer path into geosciences; a new research-focused course that is team-taught by CCRI and URI faculty; a workshop engaging students in the process of applying for internships and research opportunities; a series of information-sharing and mentoring events for prospective geoscience majors. A developmental evaluation strategy with formative and summative assessments is being applied to monitor progress in achieving project goals. This project is expected to increase the number and diversity of the pool of geosciences majors and new, practicing geoscientists. For all students, this project will have bettered the undergraduate experience and provided new mentorship and paths to professional success. Changes made to the URI and CCRI curricular programs will endure, and new community building events will foster a more engaged community, with untold positive impacts. In addition, this project will cement fledgling collaborations between 2YC and 4YC Rhode Island faculty in the geosciences, paving the way for multiple future projects. Presentations at regional and national meetings and publications resulting from this work have the potential to transfer findings and enhance experiences in the larger geoscience community."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. This international collaborative research project uses this methodology to develop scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services for selected floodplains of muddy (i.e., whitewater) rivers in the central Amazon region and their adjacent uplands. Amazon floodplains were selected because they are typical of tropical river floodplains that support high levels of biodiversity and provide fundamental services, such as water purification, fish habitat, and flood mitigation.  Like other tropical river systems, the Amazon sustains the livelihoods of many indigenous and poverty-stricken human populations and its flood plains are being increasingly threatened by development such as dams, agriculture, ranching, the expansion of road and rail networks, and climate change. For example, in the lower Amazon over half of the floodplain forest cover has been lost since the late 1970s. This project studies the floodplains of two contrasting major whitewater rivers: The Amazon River (Brazil and Colombia) and its tributary the Jurua River (Brazil). The research begins with working with stakeholders in a collaborative planning process that reflects local concerns and priorities and builds off local knowledge of the area. Work involves mapping targeted floodplains and adjacent upland habitats using remote sensing and field data. Goals are to predict changes in flooding patterns under climate change scenarios and model the interactions among biodiversity, habitat type, hydrology, and management regimes, with results being disseminated to stakeholders and the broader scientific community. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with scientists in Brazil, Columbia, France, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom and improved understanding of how human activities along the floodplains of tropical rivers impact fisheries, food security, water quality, and biodiversity. Other broader impacts include development of a template for habitat and biodiversity assessment and for participatory planning that can be applied and adapted to similar types of river floodplains across tropical landscapes.

The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support US participants in a large, seven-country, international consortium of scientists studying aquatic-terrestrial interfaces in the Amazon Basin. These areas support high levels of biodiversity and also supply fundamental services to human populations such as water purification, fish habitat, and flood mitigation as well as sustain the livelihoods and food security of subsistence-level human populations.  Over the past several decades, development, cultivation, ranching, and commercial fisheries have disrupted traditional patterns of Amazon river floodplain resource use. The goals of this research are to use the floodplains of two major and contrasting whitewater rivers: the mainstream Amazon river (Brazil and Colombia) and its tributary the Jurua (Brazil) to contrast the impacts of human development on their physical character and biodiversity.  The project engages key stakeholders, including local indigenous peoples, in a research co-design effort. Work will involve mapping floodplain and adjacent upland habitats using remote sensing and field data; predicting changes in flooding patterns under climate change scenarios; and modeling the interactions among biodiversity, habitat type, hydrology, and management regimes.

The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Using this methodology and via an international coalition of investigators from the US and four other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, this research involves integrating the economic, social, and natural sciences in a comprehensive framework to examine the consequences of human activities in coastal settings on terrestrial and nearshore marine water quality and coastal marine biodiversity. Such input is critical to ecosystem health and human well-being because many of our coastal fisheries, recreational activities, and nearshore marine ecosystems depend on the quality of freshwater that flows from the land to the sea. The US component of this international research consortium develops the economic/valuation component of the larger, coupled, modeling system that will be used to examine how changes in freshwater flows and water quality in coastal systems impact fisheries and fishing communities.  The Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada serve as case studies. Collaborators from outside the US and their parts of the project are funded through their associated national funding agencies.  Project objectives are aligned with work of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. This entity encourages the integration of economic, social, and natural sciences to understand the complexities and linkages of human impacts on ecosystems. In addition to the valuation module, the US research team will help develop the decision support framework that can be used to inform policy and ecosystem service choices for coastal regions. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration, between the US and Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and Canada. The research also has potential health implications for coastal populations and communities increasingly impacted by deterioration in freshwater sources, water quality, and loss of coastal marine biodiversity as a result of increases in coastal population pressure and habitation in a world subjected to rising sea level, increasing temperatures, and evaporation resulting from global warming. Study results will be useful to policy makers and resource managers of marine-freshwater ecosystems, with the modeling component providing useful input on possible coastal adaption strategies to climate change. Additional impacts include use of multiple communications platforms to reach out to stakeholders, the public, and policy makers to maximize utilization of and provide broad accessibility to research results.

The process starts with engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders to co-design scenarios of human and global change-associated pressures on terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems. From this input, conceptual models and mechanistic frameworks that can explore the impacts of multiple terrestrially-derived pressures on freshwater and marine biodiversity and ecosystem processes can be constructed and coded. The work of the US team focuses on providing modules to determine economic and other impacts, as a function of one or more stressors, on habitat and with regard to regulatory functions (e.g., changes in freshwater flows or/and quality/health of coastal systems). The US contribution will also provide critical input into the decision support component of the project.

Open data policies are proliferating worldwide and researchers are now required to submit DMPs with most grant proposals that describe the data they will produce and plans for sharing and preserving it. Researchers do not always know exactly what data they will produce at the beginning of a project, however. Furthermore, they have no incentives or easy methods for updating a DMP to keep things organized over the course of their research, which can lead to poor data practices and chaotic, unusable data shared at the end. DMPs in their current, static form pose similar challenges for other stakeholders across the research ecosystem, e.g., funders who must monitor compliance manually. This project will solve this problem by building out DMPRoadmap, a new, internationalized platform to reposition DMPs as true hubs of the networked research ecosystem. The principal impact of the proposed project is to transform one component of the increasingly digital research enterprise, the DMP, into an actively updated and machine-actionable hub to document and disseminate the products of research activity. Converting free-text responses to funder requirements into dynamic, verifiable data feeds will vastly improve the entire toolchain for all stakeholders and increase the velocity and availability of information across all disciplines. The software outputs of the pilot will be shared publicly with an open source license so that the community can continue to enhance and reuse the technology, extending the scholarly cyberinfrastructure in a scalable manner. All supporting data collected during the project will be made fully available for human and machine consumption. Since DMPs are rapidly becoming a global phenomenon, the outputs of the project will be of great interest to the entire research community. The breadth of the impact extends into the future of DMP policies worldwide, as machine-actionability makes change easier and continuous improvements possible. The project will provide insight into how to maximize investment in institutions and infrastructures in a manner that achieves policy goals by providing public access to government-funded research, and advances the overall public good.  By advancing best practices for data-intensive research across all disciplines the project will further the goals of the scientific endeavor.<br/><br/>The CDL will design, develop, and prototype machine-actionable DMPs based on community generated use cases; field research on DMP and data management practices; and pilot projects conducted with disciplinary and institutional partners. The work plan encompasses iterative phases of developing, implementing, and testing with various stakeholder groups using an agile methodology. Specific use cases include implementing a set of common standards and exchange protocols for DMPs to enable information to flow between DMPs and existing research information systems (e.g., offices of research, data repositories, faculty profile systems); leveraging persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs for articles and datasets, ORCID iDs for people) to trigger push/pull notifications across systems that enable stakeholders to plan resources, connect research outputs, automate reporting and monitoring, get credit, and promote data discoverability, reuse, and reproducibility; among others."

When this new technology is applied to environmental communities of microbes, typically called metaproteomics for its inclusion of a biological community, it has shown potential to significantly improve the understanding of ocean ecology and biogeochemistry by allowing a broad diagnosis of ecosystems across space and time. In this manner the measurement of proteins and the enzymes that catalyze throughout the ocean basins has great potential as a tool for ocean scientists interested in the chemistry and biology of the oceans. Yet being a relatively new data type, based in mass spectra rather than DNA sequence, proteomic datasets have their own specific informatics complexities. Currently these datasets are not easily accessed by the broader biological and chemical oceanographic communities. The researchers will develop an Ocean Protein Portal that will enable non-expert users to interrogate these large and complex ocean protein datasets.<br/><br/>The ability to connect protein distributions in the oceans, with their implied chemical functionality, with chemical and biological ocean datasets has the potential to enable a broad array of microbial and biogeochemical discovery.The proposed cyberinfrastructure will benefit the broader biological and chemical oceanographic communities through making microbial protein data widely accessible and enabling connections between biogeochemical data and the enzymes that catalyze their reactions. This foundational infrastructure would be accessible to life scientists from other (non-ocean) domains as well. The portal will also contribute to the interpretation of GEOTRACES trace metal and isotope ocean full depth ocean via the incorporation of future protein datasets and linkages to the chemical datasets in BCO-DMO. This project will provide BCO-DMO with an opportunity to research and employ new techniques for efficient data mining combined with semantic technologies that will enable better data discovery and access for its community.

Scientific data centers funded by the NSF have unique constraints that they must accommodate.  Funding is limited and costs of managing data centers using cloud technology can be quite costly.  Additionally, government funded research organizations typically have much smaller IT staffs than do corporations. The impact of managing IT operations in the cloud is not identical between large corporations and NSF funded data centers.  In the GeoSciCloud project, two medium-size NSF funded data centers plan to deploy data collections along with cloud-based services in different environments in order to assess the feasibility and impact.  These environments include:<br/>- Commercial cloud environments such as those offered by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and<br/>- NSF supported large computing facilities that are just beginning to offer services that have characteristics of cloud computing<br/>The operation of these infrastructures in these two cloud environments will be compared to current in-house environments and assessed.<br/>This project will thereby help NSF/EarthCube  identify the most suitable IT environment in which the EarthCube should deploy and support shared infrastructure.  The potential reliability and cost-savings are excellent motivating factors.<br/><br/>IRIS and UNAVCO operate data centers with several hundred terabytes of data and services that match our community's needs and requirements.  Each organization currently operates its own infrastructure. GeoSciCloud tasks will include moving subsets of our archives, as a test, into commercial cloud and XSEDE cloud environments where we will compare and contrast several aspects of working in different infrastructures. GeoSciCloud partners will also deploy key services developed under the GeoWS building block to enable access to data sets by domain scientists. <br/><br/>GeoSciCloud will help EarthCube compare and contrast the three environments (XSEDE, Commercial Cloud, and current infrastructure) in the following areas:<br/>- Gain an understanding of issues related to the ingestion of large data sets into the cloud and curating the data in a cloud environment.<br/>- Compare processing times for real world requests for data by practicing domain scientists<br/>- Test elasticity of the cloud for doing large amounts of digital signal processing of seismic data and reprocessing GPS solutions for long periods of time.<br/>- Compare the speed of data egress from multiple environments including tests of using higher access systems such as Grid-FTP.<br/>- Compare overall costs of operating in the three environments<br/>- Document what the best practices are that emerge from the GeoSciCloud test that should be promoted within EarthCube.<br/>- Perform conversion of data held in domain formats to more widely used formats such as HDF5 for improved interoperability.<br/>- Test the reliability of streaming real time data into the cloud.<br/>GeoSciCloud will also explore providing some infrastructure in support of other EarthCube partners so that multiple data centers can cohabitate within the GeoSciCloud.  IRIS and UNAVCO will commit to ultimately demonstrate the utility of shared infrastructure and how it can improve the efficiency and economics within EarthCube and specifically shared infrastructure in a cloud environment."

Annotation Engine will be embedded into existing scientific CCDR-based workflows, minimizing disruption to users. 4) Development of GeoNoteBase to enable scientists to generate citeable, reproducible workflows that draw information from across data resources, with workflows made available through keyword searches, with full attribution. This is a pilot effort to begin some of the work Through two pilot scientific projects, THROUGHPUT will test and evaluate these new capabilities and demonstrate kinds of new scientific insights that can be gained through integration."

Scientific data centers funded by the NSF have unique constraints that they must accommodate.  Funding is limited and costs of managing data centers using cloud technology can be quite costly.  Additionally, government funded research organizations typically have much smaller IT staffs than do corporations. The impact of managing IT operations in the cloud is not identical between large corporations and NSF funded data centers.  In the GeoSciCloud project, two medium-size NSF funded data centers plan to deploy data collections along with cloud-based services in different environments in order to assess the feasibility and impact.  These environments include:<br/>- Commercial cloud environments such as those offered by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and<br/>- NSF supported large computing facilities that are just beginning to offer services that have characteristics of cloud computing<br/>The operation of these infrastructures in these two cloud environments will be compared to current in-house environments and assessed.<br/>This project will thereby help NSF/EarthCube  identify the most suitable IT environment in which the EarthCube should deploy and support shared infrastructure.  The potential reliability and cost-savings are excellent motivating factors.<br/><br/>IRIS and UNAVCO operate data centers with several hundred terabytes of data and services that match our community's needs and requirements.  Each organization currently operates its own infrastructure. GeoSciCloud tasks will include moving subsets of our archives, as a test, into commercial cloud and XSEDE cloud environments where we will compare and contrast several aspects of working in different infrastructures. GeoSciCloud partners will also deploy key services developed under the GeoWS building block to enable access to data sets by domain scientists. <br/><br/>GeoSciCloud will help EarthCube compare and contrast the three environments (XSEDE, Commercial Cloud, and current infrastructure) in the following areas:<br/>- Gain an understanding of issues related to the ingestion of large data sets into the cloud and curating the data in a cloud environment.<br/>- Compare processing times for real world requests for data by practicing domain scientists<br/>- Test elasticity of the cloud for doing large amounts of digital signal processing of seismic data and reprocessing GPS solutions for long periods of time.<br/>- Compare the speed of data egress from multiple environments including tests of using higher access systems such as Grid-FTP.<br/>- Compare overall costs of operating in the three environments<br/>- Document what the best practices are that emerge from the GeoSciCloud test that should be promoted within EarthCube.<br/>- Perform conversion of data held in domain formats to more widely used formats such as HDF5 for improved interoperability.<br/>- Test the reliability of streaming real time data into the cloud.<br/>GeoSciCloud will also explore providing some infrastructure in support of other EarthCube partners so that multiple data centers can cohabitate within the GeoSciCloud.

Through targeted, oceanographic research experiences with private and governmental collaborators during the summer that continues into the academic year, this project will increase the number of high school seniors professing an interest in pursuing a geoscience major in university. Research experiences are effective in attracting and retaining students in STEM fields, and this project seeks to embed collaboration and mentoring.  Mentoring for and by women increases the likelihood of changing the longstanding culture in STEM, where competition is valued over cooperation and collaboration. This approach enhances access for underserved students in STEM: women, students of color and low income students.<br/><br/>Through the deployment of remote monitoring CTD instrumentation and deliberate mentoring by the ORCA faculty/staff and practicing geoscientists from three different employment sectors during the summer, ten students annually will experience field work, monitoring instrumentation and management of the data stream. This experience will form the basis for students to generate further testable questions while receiving research support by the project team and scientific collaborators during the academic year along with financial support. Students will demonstrate their transition to independent researchers through showcasing their research at geoscience conferences, and regional events. Summer research experiences represent an effective mechanism to retain undergraduate students once they are in the STEM pipeline, but less understood is the impact a summer research experience has on high school seniors as a motivator for declaration of a specific STEM major. By providing exposure to all aspects of a geoscience career, with special attention given to the influence of collaboration, relationship building and mentoring, this project will contribute to an understanding of how to embed research into dual enrollment coursework and which aspects are the most impactful. This project also advances knowledge specific to the Puget Sound which remains an understudied estuary. Local understanding of complex systems is a result of in-situ deployments, which rarely provide the long-term data stream that this project will create. Recent, drastic temperature spikes in the area require year round monitoring. Engaging high school students underrepresented in geosciences in the hands-on deployment of real-time instruments, giving them access to utilize and distill the complicated data stream and share these data with others represents powerful, confidence building opportunities for students as they increase community connections. The broader impacts of this project will provide further opportunities for students to showcase their work, both locally, nationally, and internationally, building their confidence and the opportunity view themselves as scientists. Engaging dually enrolled students in authentic research optimizes the intent to maximize the personal involvement in creating new knowledge. Since data is telemetered live online, anyone has access to it. This provides pride of ownership by the students, who will then further engage in problems that require innovative solutions to benefit society as a whole.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers, such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. This research project involves a coalition of investigators dedicated to advancing sustainable ecosystem services and maintaining essential biodiversity in agricultural landscapes with a focus on issues in vinicultural systems. Drivers such as soil fertility, pest regulation, biodiversity conservation, and crop production as a function of climate change that influence land use, economics, and policy decisions at the local, landscape, and regional level will be examined. The interdisciplinary research team, which includes members from the US academic sector, will develop and test predictive models that examine and integrate different land use and biodiversity scenarios across spatial scales for future farm management in viticultural regions across Europe.  Members of the team have extensive and well-documented collaborations with key stakeholders in the targeted regions including wine growers, non-governmental organizations, regional and national authorities, and extension service personnel. This research involves the iterative collection of input from stakeholders to help develop and test predictive models and to translate their results into a user-driven, decision-support tool that will provide wine-region vineyard farmers and regional authorities with better information and approaches on how to manage vinyards more sustainably and economically. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between the US, Austria, Germany, France, Spain, Romania, and The Netherlands. This large international collaboration will help build bridges collaboration and cooperation between countries and communities; engage stakeholders, ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, in the process; and develop a far-reaching and rich, publicly accessible data resource that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines.  In addition to its scientific impact, this project has societal impacts in terms of the economies of an important cash crop which will likely also impacts on US winegrowing regions. Additional impacts include the integration of research and education and the training of a postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in the larger international consortium are dedicated to synthesizing pest-control data using government-sponsored databases from Spain, France, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, and Romania. The data will be used to develop statistical models that predict variation in pest and predator abundances across European vineyards. These models will be validated against independent field measurements, collected by European colleagues, of arthropod biodiversity, pest control, and economic performance along gradients of landscape complexity and management options across five case-study regions.  Results of the study will advance understanding of the consequences of various ecosystem services that try to address pressing challenges such as climate change, decline in worldwide biodiversity, invasive species, and unsustainable land use. Essential information from those intimately involved in vinicultural processes and land management will be collected via local focus groups which will generate stakeholder-driven scenarios. These case studies will be used to drive models that will be created and used to examine the most effective way of providing sustainable use. The validated models will be used to explore the biodiversity, ecosystem service, and crop production consequences of alternative land-use decisions under a range of social, economic and ecological restrictions.  Collaborators from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a new approach that integrates computer modelling with collection and analysis of archaeological and geological data spanning the last one million years. Computer-generated models will test hypotheses about how various human activities and climatic processes influence environmental changes that can be detected in archaeological and geological data. This project will help with conservation and management decisions concerning people and the environment that can be applied anywhere in the world. This project will also develop high school curricular materials to explore how the natural world is shaped by climatic and human-driven processes.<br/><br/>Geological and archaeological archives afford the opportunity to explore coupled human-natural systems over evolutionary timescales. The challenge is to disentangle natural and human systems, and their coupling, in the deep past. This project outlines an innovative approach for studying ancient human-environment interactions by integrating empirical geological and archaeological data with generative modeling. The latter provides a framework for understanding how processes that occur over ecological or ethnographic time-scales are reflected in time-averaged fossil archives. This approach, which can be applied virtually anywhere in the world, will be implemented in a study the Cape Floristic Region in southern Africa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and biodiversity hotspot of global significance. Although this exceedingly diverse ecosystem is under increasing threat from modern development, the legacy of human impact stretches back hundreds of millennia. This project aims to resolve the extent to which climatic and anthropogenic impacts have shaped the evolutionary history of this unique ecosystem, including the degree to which ecological functions provided by people are important to maintaining biodiversity. This will be accomplished through a program that includes primary data collection in the field and laboratory, and the integration and modelling of existing datasets to connect archaeological, paleoclimatic, paleontological, paleoecological, and geological archives that span the last one million years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This characterization may be true for long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane, but it is not true of compounds that are considered short-lived local pollutants (SLLPs) such as particulate matter, black carbon, sulfur dioxide and tropospheric ozone. These short-lived pollutants impact atmospheric conditions and air quality through different mechanisms over a range of spatial and temporal scales. LLGHGs and SLLPs are often co-emitted by the same processes, albeit in widely differing quantities and combinations, but to date, scientists and policymakers have largely treated these different types of emissions as both interchangeable and separable. This approach is incomplete because individual emissions species rarely can be mitigated in isolation and the net global and regional impacts of different mitigation portfolios should consider the sum of both LLGHG and SLLP effects. A full understanding of environmental impacts, and of mitigation costs and benefits, requires that SLLPs and LLGHGs be considered together, and thus is the focus of this project. Additionally, this project will contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by training several undergraduate and graduate students to work on interdisciplinary research of societal importance.<br/>This project will utilize a coupled systems approach to understanding the joint roles of LLGHGs and SLLPs in the dynamics of natural (atmospheric) and human (policymaking) systems, as well as in the processes that connect them. The objectives of this project are to 1) characterize the joint emissions of SLLPs and LLGHGs across, space, time and sector, 2) build analytical infrastructure that enables integrated analysis that is useable to both scientists and policy makers, 3) understand the mechanisms driving regional differences in the atmospheric concentrations and radiative forcing induced by identical emissions, 4) build a dynamical framework explaining the spatial pattern and magnitude of global response to individual SLLP hotspots, 5) assemble and merge novel state-of-the-art data on environmental conditions with data on agricultural and health outcomes, 6) use spatial econometrics to derive location-specific exposure-response relationships for atmospheric conditions on human health and crop yields, 7) fully couple the human and natural dynamics systems to iteratively understand how local and global costs and benefits, based on realistic implementations of national mitigations commitments, their atmospheric effects, and their locally-specific health and crop yield impacts, drive national optimal mitigation levels and overall global mitigation."

The challenges stem from the fact that the issues of food, water and energy are often tightly connected with each other, not only locally but also globally. This is known as the Food-Water-Energy (FWE) nexus.  An effective solution to a local water problem may cause new local problems with food or energy, or cause new water problems at the global level. On a local scale, it is difficult to anticipate whether solutions to one issue in the nexus are sustainable across food, water and energy systems, both at the local and the global scale.  Innovative solutions that encompass the nexus are particularly important to enable cities to better manage their food, water and energy systems and understand the benefits and tradeoffs for different solutions.  <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 29-country initiative through the joint Belmont Forum- Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe.  The Sustainable Urbanization Global Initiative (SUGI)/Food-Water-Energy Nexus is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that bring together the fragmented research and expertise across the globe to find innovative solutions to the Food-Water-Energy Nexus challenge.  The call seeks to develop more resilient, applied urban solutions to benefit a much wider range of stakeholders. The rapid urbanization of the world's population underscores the importance of this focus. International partners were invited to develop solutions for this challenge.  The funds requested will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>The process of urban development not only typically changes the landscape but also affects precipitation systems, water cycles, the productivity of the ecosystem, energy balance and local climates.  This project aims to provide information on how the food, water and energy systems are changed under different aspects of urbanization.  Through the use of Urban Living Labs, data will be obtained from participating cities working on various urban planning issues.  From this data, the project will develop an integrated decision support system that uses a geographic information system to help in urban planning using different scenarios .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These predictions require many computer simulations to account for uncertainties in the storm's size, track, and intensity.  To be fast, these simulations use simplified representations of the coastline and the ocean physics.  Simulations with fine-scale representations have been shown to be more accurate, but they are far too slow on current supercomputers to use when time is limited to achieve reliable predictions.  This trade-off has limited the accuracy of real-time simulations and increases the uncertainty for decision-makers and coastal residents. This project will develop, test, and implement ways to embed fine-scale information into coarse-scale storm surge models using high-resolution elevation maps to correct mass balances, bottom friction, and other quantities. The resulting models will keep most of the high-resolution accuracy while having speeds comparable to the simpler coarse models which will lead to more accurate pre-storm simulations, improving decision-making for policy-makers, emergency management personnel, and coastal residents. The work performed in this project will not only enable increased accuracy in ensemble surge forecasts, but will also decrease computational costs for a given accuracy in higher resolution studies. It will enable entirely new types of studies including decadal-level simulations using reanalysis products or climate model outputs. This approach also opens the way for dynamical global surge/tide simulations, which do not presently exist. Results will add little to costs, while significantly increasing accuracy.

This will allow for a user-chosen compromise between speed, accuracy, and data availability. By rigorously addressing this closure hierarchy, this project will develop a much stronger physical understanding of how very specific flow and land features impact hydrodynamics at different scales. Specifically, this research will lead to new insights on how coastal flooding is controlled by unresolved flows through marshes, natural channels, and man-made canals, and how best to model these unresolved scales.

Current rapid-response management is based on empirical or semi-empirical models developed more than 40 years ago. The focus of this project is to create a Multistage Wildfire Research and Prediction System (MWRPS) that links several existing community, open source models developed. This new model has the potential to change how fire is studied, and significantly improve operational wildfire and smoke forecasting. MWRPS will serve as tool for fire professionals, urban and environmental planners, and disaster managers who need to determine the societal and ecological impacts of wildfire and smoke. As a community model, MWRPS will be available to the public to examine a variety of hazard-related issues.  In addition to graduate student and postdoctoral training, the project includes a plan for K-12 outreach through the Hi-GEAR program.<br/><br/>Sudden changes in flow at the fire line are crucial to extreme fire behavior and associated hazards. Because flow at the fire line can significantly impact fire spread and subsequently all wildfire behavior, prediction and simulation of coupled atmosphere-fire flow must be accurate from synoptic down to fire line scales. Accurate prediction requires the ability to model rapid synoptically-driven changes in local winds, realistically render flow in complex terrain, and capture the impacts of the fire itself on local weather. To meet this challenge, the Multistage Wildfire Research and Prediction System (MWRPS), a multi-scale model, 3D model will be developed based on fundamental fluid dynamical principles. MWRPS will have the ability to resolve buildings, trees, and land cover, to incorporate the effects of complex terrain, different vegetation types and geometries, to disperse smoke, and to represent radiation, sensible, and latent heating in the wildfire environment. Predicted wildfire properties from this model will include high resolution temporal and spatial evolution of the fire perimeter and intensity; behavior for both surface and crown fires; smoke production and dispersion in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) or through tree canopies (crucial for planning a proposed prescribed burn); and impacts of smoke concentrations and of heat flux in safety zones and on WUI structures. In addition to the model development, three aspects of extreme wildfire behavior will be addressed: the roles of (1) fuel heterogeneity, (2) complex topography, and (3) fire interactions. A data-driven system will be developed for atmosphere-fire models to steer simulations from a multitude of sources including: weather data, sensors, airborne fire images, and satellite remote sensing in a statistically sound manner. <br/>"

The Plateau has increasingly received worldwide attention due its rapid biophysical and socioeconomic changes. Building upon intensive previous work in the region, the purpose of this study is to bring together a multidisciplinary research team to examine and model the changes of the natural and human systems on the Plateau as well as the critical feedbacks between them over recent decades. The project team hypothesizes that while climate change has created pressure on ecosystems and societies in the Plateau, the distinct socioeconomic conditions and development paths of the different administrative units involved have also had a significant effect on the relationships and feedbacks within the human and natural systems. The team will also test the hypothesis that the human influences on the systems exceeded those of the biophysical changes but the significance varies in time, location, and ecological setting. The five major underlying processes studied for the natural systems will include the changes in water fluxes, radiation, soil heat fluxes, primary production, and carbon loss, while the five processes for the human systems are economic growth, population growth, urbanization, technology advancement, and lifestyle change. The system functions and changes will be examined by the life expectancy index, income index, education index, net primary production, evapotranspiration, and ecosystem carbon loss. More importantly, the project team will focus on the relationships between these functions, such as the productivity vs. income index. The connection between the human and natural systems will be viewed through the lens of land use cover and land use change. The progression of causes and consequences will be examined at various levels through three tasks: 1) modeling household behaviors and surrounding ecosystems; 2) studying divergent trajectories for Mongolian systems from past to future; and 3) understanding the vulnerabilities within the system and possible future adaptation strategies toward a sustainable Plateau. The multiple dimensions of the systems will be integrated together systemically, holistically, and across disciplines. <br/><br/>The results of this study will have global implications, especially to this and other regions that are vulnerable to climate and socioeconomic changes. The project will strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration between ecology, economics, anthropology, sociology, and demography and will provide a great opportunity for junior scholars as well as graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research. Data and findings will be disseminated through a series of transformative activities that benefit the people on the Plateau, students in the US, China, and Mongolia, the scientific community, and stakeholders and policymakers worldwide. Recognizing past difficulties in accessing the data for the Plateau, the project team will first develop a comprehensive database that can be shared with the entire scientific community. Intensive training classes and cross-campus courses will be made available through a virtual classroom using state-of-the-art cyber technology to link researchers and students in the US, Inner Mongolia, and Mongolia. Researchers will deliver invited guest lectures at least twice per term via the virtual classroom and students from the participating universities will be simultaneously exposed to diverse views from each other?s institutions.

Large volcanic eruptions can reduce average global temperatures and suppress average global precipitation. This is known to have had dramatic effects on annual rainfall on the Nile watershed in historic times. The human response to this annual flooding, and to its variability over the years, was the major driver of Egyptian history up to the completion of the high dam at Aswan in 1970. This project, a collaboration among historians, scientists, hydrologists, and statisticians, seeks to understand the coupling between the hydrological cycle and human society in Egypt during the Hellenistic era (305 BCE - 30 BCE), a well-documented period of economic, technological and social change with often violent rivalries between major regional powers. The results will also inform our understanding of best-practice responses to the changing climate in the modern world. The project will inform the broad public about human and natural systems and the complex interactions between them at diverse scales, through a traveling exhibition program developed at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History. <br/><br/>This project will capitalize upon a rare confluence of natural and human archives for Ancient Egypt and the Near East. By comparing rich historical records (papyrus documents and inscriptions) with environmental data and regional climate and hydrologic simulations for repeated abrupt climate events, the research will determine whether and how social dynamics are climate-driven, and whether and how human water management affects regional climate and hydrology. Volcanic eruptions provide tests of human and natural system sensitivity to abrupt shocks because their repeated occurrence allows the identification of systematic relationships in the presence of random variability. The project will make three important contributions: (1) integrate historical data from a wealth of different archives to analyze the connections between climate variability, social unrest, and institutional change during the Hellenistic era; (2) improve knowledge of hydrological responses to volcanic eruptions; (3) document the extent of human impacts on Mediterranean hydrology. Simulations will be used to evaluate the climatic impact of large and sustained volcanism and intensive regional water management. This historical analysis will delineate the mechanisms through which environmental stress influenced state-level behaviors, community responses (such as changes in land and water management), and interstate conflict during the Hellenistic period, and how in return human activities interactively affected soils, land cover, hydrology, and regional climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, high paying, high demand jobs in the geosciences and the need for diversity in these fields means these students may miss an opportunity to put their interests in science to work. This is especially true of students beginning their undergraduate education at two year institutions, which are play an ever increasing role in the landscape of higher education.  Nearly 54% of minority students in STEM begin their undergraduate education at a community college, making efforts to engage and support such students and better prepare them to transfer to and succeed at 4-year institutions is so important. The Geoscience Engagement and Outreach (GEO) project promotes progress in science for students through the recruitment, mentoring and support of a cohort of two-year college students from underrepresented populations. Activities include faculty mentored research in a sub-set of geoscience subdisciplines, as well as skill building for careers to produce graduates prepared for the expectations of future employers. Documenting the potential of cross-institutional, integrated research and education experiences being developed through this project for retaining diverse students in the geosciences contributes to the literature on STEM recruitment and retention. The project also is expected to increase the number and caliber of faculty available to mentor undergraduates and foster continued education in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The GEO project is addressing barriers to engagement, recruitment, and retention of diverse students in the geosciences pipeline through an innovative three-institution collaboration that combines and leverages the strengths of Santa Fe College, a two year teaching institution; the University of Florida, a four year research institution; and the Orlando Science Center, a nonprofit informal education and outreach venue.  The GEO project offers students authentic geoscience research experiences explicitly integrated with practical applications and scaffolded to classroom work. Project goals include: (1) fostering retention of the participating GEO students at Santa Fe College and transfer into Bachelor's degree programs in the geosciences, (2) strengthening collaborations among Santa Fe College teaching faculty, University of Florida researchers, and Orlando Science Center informal science educators, and (3) increasing student interest in geoscience careers through public outreach development of resources for in-service teachers. GEO's three phases of seminar-style teaching, research mentoring with outreach project development and delivery, and a culminating capstone experience scaffold the program elements into an emerging geoscience Associates degree at Santa Fe College. The project is designed to support three annual cohorts of 6 students each, with integration of peer- and supervisor-mentoring and collaborations among the three institutions.  The project is targeted toward recruitment of underrepresented populations and their retention in geoscience fields. University of Florida faculty are mentoring student research in the geoscience sub-disciplines of meteorology, soil hydrology, and geoscience and STEM education. The Orlando Science Center is supervising a paid 6-week summer internship that emphasizes communications and outreach skills development. GEO students are designing and conducting outreach with diverse public audiences, teachers and high school volunteers through OSC's Otronicon. Continuation of research and outreach activities during the Fall semester culminates in the completion of a two year degree by GEO cohort students and their transfer to a four year geosciences program, prepared to continue and thrive alongside their four year institution peers. Project evaluation is measuring student content gain, using the Geoscience Concept Inventory; in addition, increases in a student's science identity and potential interest in pursuing geoscience careers are being assessed."

The low numbers of African-American, Hispanic, and Native-American students graduating with either undergraduate or graduate degrees in the geosciences is the lowest within all of the STEM fields. In general, the rate at which geoscientists are trained in this country will not be enough to fill the large number of vacant STEM positions to be created in the near future.  Despite continued efforts, the geosciences community still has difficulty recruiting and retaining students and faculty from underrepresented groups, and there are very few geosciences programs at minority serving institutions like Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Training of geoscientists is critical for the nation since informed decisions on important global issues related to energy, water management, climate change, and air quality require training in the geosciences.  For example, because severe weather events have impacted the most vulnerable (low income and minority) communities, it is imperative that students from these communities be trained in the geosciences to help create a pool of qualified professionals who can then address the issues of severe weather impacts in disadvantaged communities and provide climate and severe weather literacy. <br/><br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop a sustainable pipeline to undergraduate and/or graduate programs in atmospheric sciences at NCAT through a new program design. The program design has four components: 1) Recruitment of qualified students through competitive selection criteria and financial support, 2) Cohort building activities based on reported best practices, 3) Undergraduate year round research opportunity at NCAT complemented with field trips to atmospheric sciences and meteorology facilities in the region and the state, and 4) Short but intensive research trip to Colorado State University and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).<br/>The proposed program will provide carefully designed problem-based academic-year geosciences (atmospheric sciences) research experience for cohorts of eight undergraduate students competitively selected annually (24 over the life of the grant). The cohort will be recruited from a pool of undeclared majors (sophomores and juniors) at NCAT, pre-service teachers and seniors from the Early STEM College high school on the campus of NCAT. The research experience will include topics that are socially relevant in atmospheric chemistry and weather and climate modeling.  The key mechanisms for creating an environment of innovation will be exposure to the cutting-edge research in major university and national research laboratories during internships. The research experience is enhanced and enriched through short visits to Colorado State University and NCAR and daylong field trips to local National Weather Service facilities, NOAA, facilities, university facilities and private weather and climate related facilities."

By creating three cohort groups of six Fellows linked to two tribal colleges and universities, this initiative will be able to compare and contrast the pathways of these Fellows at each site to determine the most effective strategies to (1) increase the number of Indigenous (Native American and Latino) students who are engaged in community-based geosciences research, field experiences and careers;  (2) develop work and training programs for Indigenous tribal college and university students interested in the geosciences; (3) build a network of community-based science professionals who are committed to the success of Native American and Latino students and provide ongoing support for personal, academic and professional success; and (4) prepare these students to transfer to undergraduate or graduate school. These goals align with the GEO Education and Diversity Strategic Framework goals of developing a diverse, competitive, and engaged geosciences workforce. Specific objectives of the NPNSF initiative are to match 18 promising tribal college and university students annually with hands-on field work and professional research experiences to build skills and pathways to academic and professional careers in the geosciences. These students will also be mentored by geosciences professionals and a supportive cohort network throughout the year.<br/><br/>Part II: Native Pathways/Native Science Fellows (NPNSF) will enable Native American and Latino undergraduate students to access tribal college and university academic tracks that lead to graduation, fellowships with organizations that offer real world work experiences in the geosciences, and support of local cohorts of students that are on similar paths.

While research universities are likely to offer such opportunities to undergraduate students, non-research colleges and universities usually have limited ability to provide science projects for their students. To address this need, we propose to develop an educational center that will serve students at two non-research institutions in Puerto Rico. Through the center we will link students with researchers who will guide them in conducting research in Puerto Rico?s coastal lagoons. Hispanic students will be involved in a variety of activities during the summer and academic year focusing on experiential learning in the geosciences. Students will gain research experience and exposure to marine science professionals through networking, internships, and travel to national meetings. The students will also participate in geosciences professional development activities (e.g. personal statement writing, science communication, oral presentations, etc.). The center will foster partnerships among research and non-research institutions and government and non-profit institutions interested in building a sustainable and effective education center focused on Puerto Rico?s coastal lagoons. The project includes a diverse interdisciplinary team of scientists and educators from both the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. The team and center are committed to increasing marine science learning opportunities for underrepresented and underserved students. <br/><br/>II Technical<br/>In an effort to close the opportunity gap and enhance STEM retention for underrepresented groups at primarily non-research colleges and universities, we will establish the Tropical Oceanography Research Training for Undergraduate Academics (TORTUGA) Center to introduce early- through advanced-stage undergraduate students from Puerto Rico to geoscience education and research. This center will link research and non-research institutions to strengthen research capacity and establish educational programs to teach research skills to undergraduates in STEM fields. Specific goals of the TORTUGA Center are to: 1) build sustainable multidisciplinary education and experiential learning programs focused on coastal science problems and solutions; 2) increase access for underrepresented students to watershed, coastal, and marine science education; 3) develop institutional structures to assist students at critical educational junctures, increase student retention in STEM fields, and encourage pursuit of geoscience careers; and 4) adapt this model and strengthen its long-term sustainability. To do this we will: 1) strengthen and expand existing cross-institutional partnerships and team science research programs we have developed over the past five years through a series of pilot projects; 2) provide research opportunities at minority-serving institutions in Puerto Rico for coastal and watershed geoscience research; and 3) evaluate and assess our educational practice model in light of our program goals and current educational pedagogy research. An anticipated outcome of this project is a set of best practices for increasing STEM retention in primarily non-research institutions serving underrepresented groups, focused largely on Puerto Rican and Hispanic populations but applicable to a broad spectrum of undergraduate experiences."

Through research and professional experiences, a diverse group of undergraduate students is being prepared for future work in geoscience fields. Additionally, their supervisors are being better prepared to mentor diverse students, improving recruitment and retention in geosciences. IDEA-2.0 represents a coordinated effort between a research-intensive university and a historically black university to bolster participation in geoscience education, especially the participation of URM and women students. The institutionalization of existing, informal partnerships is building a foundation for ongoing support of evidence-based, career-relevant geoscience experiences for undergraduates while also better preparing faculty to mentor diverse students. Additional partners in this effort include the following geoscience departments at UNC-Chapel Hill: Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Geography, Geology, Marine Sciences and the Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology.  Over time, it is anticipated that the combination of sustained professional development opportunities for students combined with enhanced preparation of mentors will contribute to cultural shifts within institutions that are likely to promote greater diversity in geoscience disciplines and the workforce. Thus, this project serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The IDEA-2.0 program has a goal of broadening participation in and institutional capacity to offer career-relevant geoscience education at UNC-Chapel Hill and North Carolina Central University, while generating useful insights into how such practices could be implemented successfully at other institutions. Program goals are being accomplished through the following objectives: 1. Engage up to 30 students - including underrepresented minority (URM) and women students - in evidence-based, career-relevant experiences that prepare them for work or further study in geosciences; 2. Prepare a subset of faculty, postdoctoral scholars and graduate students to mentor a diverse group of students and contribute to broad understanding of how the mentoring experience influences recruitment and retention in the geosciences pipeline; and 3. Build capacity to sustain coordinated programming across departments at UNC-Chapel Hill and to fund and implement new programming at NCCU. By targeting students who are rising sophomores and juniors, IDEA-2.0 focuses on the critical juncture between high school and commitment to undergraduate geoscience programs. The first two years of undergraduate study are a critical time to recruit/retain STEM majors; early engagement in research has been shown to contribute to institutional-level success in engaging URM students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Mentoring interactions also have been shown to reinforce students' confidence in their ability to succeed and are associated with higher grades in STEM courses, higher rates of degree completion, and, for STEM-focused recruitment and retention programs, with participants' ultimate pursuit of science careers. For these reasons, IDEA-2.0 seeks to engage mentors in an ongoing cycle of professional development that prepares them to meet the mentorship needs of diverse students. The explicit focus of this project is on understanding the mentoring relationship - both its influence on student career and academic choices as well as faculty confidence and competence in supporting diverse teams - contributing to our understanding of how to effectively foster diversity in STEM fields."

At two-year colleges in particular, students have even fewer opportunities to participate in authentic research projects.  The Austin Community College (ACC) project includes the development and implementation of: a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience Course (SUREC) and a field activity that engages students in research experience focused on scientific ocean drilling in their first two years of higher education.  The significance of the project is that it will capture the attention of incoming undergraduate students by engaging them in a research-based field activity during the school year and further their research experience through an intense inquiry-based learning in the summer.  This will advance the mission of the National Science Foundation's Improving Undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) Education - GEOPATHS program by promoting and supporting students to continue in geosciences at the critical junctures.<br/><br/>Through a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin, the SUREC program will be open to students in their second year of study. ACC students will conduct research at a laboratory in the department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering (UT PGE). The research experience will begin with guided scientific ocean drilling investigations supported by class explanation, group meetings and related scientific reading assignments. As students identify research topics, lab equipment and procedures, student teams will research more independently. Students will present their research in-lieu of a final exam and also have opportunities to present their work at a local and/or national conference. SUREC and its evaluation materials will be developed over eight months, followed by two years of implementation and evaluation. The field activity will be open to both ACC science and non-science majors in their first or second year of higher education. Through a partnership with Texas A&M University, students enrolled in introductory geoscience courses will take a field trip to the Gulf Coast Repository, where over 100 kilometers of core from the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and the Southern Ocean are located. Prior to the activity, students will complete pre-field activities including reading articles from scientific journals and exercises that related to the repository. After the visit, students will integrate findings to produce a term paper. The field activity will include four months for development of exercises and evaluation material, followed by two years of implementation and evaluation. By the end of the project, at least 24 second year students will have participated in the SUREC program and 150 first/second year non-science and science majors will have participated in the field activity."

This is especially true of students beginning their undergraduate education at two year institutions, which are play an ever increasing role in the landscape of higher education.  Nearly 54% of minority students in STEM begin their undergraduate education at a community college, making efforts to engage and support such students and better prepare them to transfer to and succeed at 4-year institutions is so important. The Geoscience Engagement and Outreach (GEO) project promotes progress in science for students through the recruitment, mentoring and support of a cohort of two-year college students from underrepresented populations. Activities include faculty mentored research in a sub-set of geoscience subdisciplines, as well as skill building for careers to produce graduates prepared for the expectations of future employers. Documenting the potential of cross-institutional, integrated research and education experiences being developed through this project for retaining diverse students in the geosciences contributes to the literature on STEM recruitment and retention. The project also is expected to increase the number and caliber of faculty available to mentor undergraduates and foster continued education in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The GEO project is addressing barriers to engagement, recruitment, and retention of diverse students in the geosciences pipeline through an innovative three-institution collaboration that combines and leverages the strengths of Santa Fe College, a two year teaching institution; the University of Florida, a four year research institution; and the Orlando Science Center, a nonprofit informal education and outreach venue.  The GEO project offers students authentic geoscience research experiences explicitly integrated with practical applications and scaffolded to classroom work. Project goals include: (1) fostering retention of the participating GEO students at Santa Fe College and transfer into Bachelor's degree programs in the geosciences, (2) strengthening collaborations among Santa Fe College teaching faculty, University of Florida researchers, and Orlando Science Center informal science educators, and (3) increasing student interest in geoscience careers through public outreach development of resources for in-service teachers. GEO's three phases of seminar-style teaching, research mentoring with outreach project development and delivery, and a culminating capstone experience scaffold the program elements into an emerging geoscience Associates degree at Santa Fe College. The project is designed to support three annual cohorts of 6 students each, with integration of peer- and supervisor-mentoring and collaborations among the three institutions.

Statistically, geoscience fields are the least ethnically diverse of all the sciences with only about 9% of BS/BA and 2% of PhD?s going to URM candidates nationally. The number of students receiving geoscience degrees will not meet future workforce demands and URM students represent an untapped resource to fill this demand.  Increasing the retention of students and increasing the number of URM students enrolling in the geosciences can address these problems.  The goal of this GP-EXTRA project is to recruit and retain students in the geosciences through a multi-institutional near-surface (NS) geophysics applied field experience. <br/>The field experience will focus on addressing ongoing scientific questions in critical zone science.  It will expose students to state-of-the-art geophysical equipment, an active field research laboratory, and experts in near-surface geophysics and critical zone science, and potential geoscience career paths.  This positive field experience and post-activity mentoring will provide GEOPATH students with a sense of community within the geosciences and increase the likelihood that they will continue to pursue careers in the geosciences. <br/><br/>Part II<br/>As outlined in the GP-EXTRA program solicitation, the number of students receiving geoscience degrees will not meet the future workforce demand. This problem can be addressed by both increasing the retention of students and increasing the number of students enrolling in the geosciences.  In particular, minority students are severely underrepresented in the geoscience fields and represent an untapped resource to fill this demand.  To address this problem, we propose to implement a multi-institutional near-surface (NS) geophysics applied field experience, focused on addressing ongoing scientific questions in critical zone science. The experience will expose students to state-of-the-art geophysical equipment, an active field research laboratory, experts in near-surface geophysics and critical zone science, and potential geoscience career paths.<br/>The GEOPATH (GP) students in the NS geophysics field experience will be drawn from the two primary institutions involved in this project:  Rutgers University, Newark (RN), a Hispanic- Serving Institution, and Temple University (TU).  These institutions are connected to 2- and 4-year colleges via the Garden State-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (GS-LSAMP; PI Gates), the Northern New Jersey Bridge to the Baccalaureate (NNJB2B) program, and Temple Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP).  GP students will also be drawn from secondary participating 4-year institutions in the northeast (Penn State University, Dickinson College, Kutztown University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Bucknell University).<br/>Recruitment of GP students from these institutions will focus on underrepresented minorities (URMs) and students from 2-year institutions. The participants will be lower-level undergraduate students (freshman/sophomores) who will have a unique opportunity to participate in a NS geophysics field experience, usually only taught to upper-level undergraduate students.  These students are at a critical juncture in their academic career when exposure to opportunities and career options can have an impact on decisions about which major to choose.  Focusing our recruitment on first and second year students will also ensure students enter the field experience with an equivalent exposure to the subject matter regardless of academic background.<br/>The field experience will be held at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SH-CZO).  This field site is ideal as it will expose students to ongoing research in critical zone science. The syllabus and NS geophysics problem sets for the field experience will be developed to address pressing research questions at the SH-CZO. At field stations, GP students will work alongside a graduate student mentor in smaller cohorts (6 students); larger group workshops and presentations are integrated in the schedule to give students the resources to work effectively within a group, learn how to design a research experiment, and analyze datasets.  The 2-week field experience will conclude with smaller cohort presentations and a workshop on careers available within the geosciences. Students will enter the field experience as individual students and leave as a team of geoscience students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to make a more informed decision about their future goals and interests. <br/>The project aims to retain most of these students in the geosciences through a positive field experience and post-activity mentoring. GEOPATH (GP) students will be linked with volunteers from within the RN and TU Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) student chapters, providing the GP students with a sense of community within the geosciences and increase the likelihood that this cohort will continue to pursue careers in the geosciences."

JSU has a four-year graduation rate of nineteen percent, which suggests either students are not being well-prepared prior to college or there is a greater need for support services for incoming students. Although graduation rates are low, 75% of HBCU students are low-income students and the HBCU graduation rates of these students outperforms those at all other institutions (USBE&IT, 2015). In 2014,  understanding the need to develop students with career relevant competencies and skills, Jackson Public Schools created the Academy of Scientific Innovations at Provine High School with a division in atmospheric science. The introduction of the division was in direct response from our Associate Dean and the fact that Provine is within a mile from JSU Meteorology Program. Through this program students will: increase their understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the geosciences; acquire hands-on geoscience teaching experience; and be exposed to possible careers in the geosciences (including teaching); while acquiring real-world, geoscience workforce skills.

The GEO STEM Pathway incorporates specifically designed student learning outcomes at all critical junctures of the students' progress. The pathway is designed for stop-out/move-in, so that students facing external, unanticipated challenges can leave the program with an academic credential and an established set of skills attractive to industry and rejoin the path later, once they are ready.  This pathway is more than a recommended progression of required and elective coursework and academic curriculum. The pathway employs selected high impact practices in education aimed at native Hawaiian and other STEM students at critical junctures in the pathway to support student retention and persistence.<br/><br/>The Primary goal of the University of Hawaii (UH) GP-IMPACT project is to increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students who enroll, persist, and complete a degree program in the Geology, Environmental/Earth, and Ocean (GEO) Sciences at the University of Hawaii. To accomplish this goal the UH will create a formal GEO academic pathway and college collaboration between UH Manoa School of Ocean, Earth and Science Technology (SOESTS) and the two largest community colleges in the State. This partnership will: 1. Develop engaging and sustained academic and career pathways in Geosciences from K-12 to higher education and between 2- and 4-year colleges. 2. Build capacity for career relevant geoscience programs in Hawaii; 3. Broaden participation in GEO Sciences by leveraging high impact practices for engagement of underrepresented groups, particularly native Hawaiians. 4. Provide opportunities for UH GEO students, faculty, and staff to engage in effective strategies that ensure learning, support teaching and strengthen undergraduate research experiences. The Hawaii GEO Pathway consortium envisions sustained inter-campus and UH system partnerships, a collaboratively developed and rigorous geoscience curriculum, effective recruitment, retention, and cohort experiences with strong support services and engaged learning opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though few in number, these indigenous scientists play a key role in bridging the communities of western scientific research and indigenous knowledge. These scholars have, individually, explored this bridging role through their own research and education activities, but larger questions remain unresolved and require synthesis efforts. To this end, the project centers on a symposium of scholars designed to formulate a vision for hydrology research and education centered on Native American perspectives and indigenous water knowledge. Such a meeting has never taken place before. The proposed ?Symposium on Indigenous Water Knowledge and Hydrologic Science? will be held at the Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT during August 2018. Symposium objectives include: 1) defining research and education priorities in the hydrologic sciences that are relevant to indigenous peoples in a rapidly changing world; 2) establishing a network of indigenous hydrologists, other scholars, and traditional knowledge holders of water; and 3) identifying educational needs and tools to support integration of indigenous perspectives in hydrology. A key long-term goal of this project is to build and maintain a scholarly community that is simultaneously connected to the cutting edge of hydrology and related disciplines and firmly rooted to indigenous knowledge and pressing water-related issues of tribes today.<br/><br/>Part II<br/><br/>The ""Symposium on Indigenous Water Knowledge and Hydrologic Science"" will bring together hydrologists and others in August 2018 at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT to address key questions regarding the water-related research and education needs of tribal communities that can be answered with solutions rooted in indigenous knowledge systems. The symposium will also address the role of indigenous knowledge in crosscutting, water-related research. Participants will develop a vision and action plan for integrating indigenous perspectives and knowledge into hydrologic science and related disciplines.  Symposium organizers and participants are well equipped and ideally positioned to address these topics and to bridge indigenous communities with each other in a collaborative manner. The project has implications for broadening participation of Native Americans in hydrology and related disciplines.  Approximately 1000 Native American hold degrees at any level in the geosciences (including Earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences) and Native American hydrologists constitute a small fraction of this number. Tribal colleges and minority serving organizations work in a variety of ways to increase representation of Native American hydrologists in the workforce and academia, but indigenous voices remain few. The symposium will include discussions of culturally responsive education materials and specific opportunities for participants to provide leadership in areas related to professional development of Native American hydrologists. The symposium will thus enhance and support efforts to increase the number of Native Americans pursuing degrees in hydrology and related fields. Student participants will be actively engaged to foster involvement and enthusiasm in the upcoming generation of indigenous hydrologists. Symposium participants will include faculty from research institutions as well as tribal colleges, with tribal college faculty making up  25%-30% of participants."

However, diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is much lower than U.S. demographics, representing a growing threat to the competitiveness of the U.S. science and technology sector. This project focuses on improving the success and persistence of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science, specifically marine science. The innovation of this work is that, rather than students working on projects developed and assigned by research faculty, faculty will mentor students through the entire process of developing, designing and conducting their own research. Preliminary results indicate that not only does this student-centered model result in students being more likely to self-identify as scientists, they also produce research of publishable caliber. As a result, students stay in science and continue into graduate school and careers in STEM, helping diversify our STEM workforce and transforming the next generation of marine scientists.<br/> <br/>Underrepresented minorities (URMs) are significantly less likely to participate in STEM careers than other ethnicities, particularly within the geosciences. This pattern is partially a result of the fact that field experiences, a foundational activity that promotes retention and fosters careers in geosciences, can often be exclusionary towards women and URMs. The Diversity Project (TDP), founded in 2005, was designed to increase diversity in marine science by providing a transformative international undergraduate research experience for URMs. Until 2012, TDP employed a traditional top-down research experience for undergraduates (REU) model where students work on a subset of the PI's research. However, beginning in 2013, TDP implemented a novel bottom-up, student-centered approach that focused on maximizing student engagement, exploration, and excitement. Rather than being assigned projects, students are mentored through the process of scientific inquiry, starting with observations, formulating hypotheses, and ending with designing and conducting their own research to test those hypotheses. Preliminary research suggests that this bottom-up model results in more students publishing their research, higher participation in national and international scientific conferences, and increased interest in graduate school compared to the traditional top-down REU model. This proposal has two primary goals: 1) To compare the efficacy of bottom-up and top-down REU field programs in advancing the success of underrepresented minority students in the geosciences through comparison of long-term metrics of student success; 2) To assess the impacts (both quantitatively and qualitatively) of bottom-up and top-down summer field research programs on the success of URM students in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Earth Science was not previously a required course in the State curriculum, and Iowa high schools must now meet the challenge of achieving NGSS Earth Science proficiency objectives in a state with very few K-12 educators certified or endorsed in Earth Science. What few Iowa high schools do teach Earth Science typically present it as a 'remedial science' instead of as the integration and application of all of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. The recent adoption of NGSS in the State, the critical need to train K-12 educators statewide in Earth Science, and the need to incorporate more rigor in the presentation of Earth Science provide an opportunity to reframe Earth Science education in Iowa as the capstone STEM discipline. Improving Earth Science education in the state has potential to significantly increase the exposure of students to Earth Science at an early stage and improve their awareness of the field as an interdisciplinary STEM discipline and potential career path. High school students who become interested in Earth Science must also have opportunities for engagement and professional preparation as they matriculate to colleges and universities if they are eventually to transition successfully into an Earth Science career and help to rebuild the aging geoscience workforce. This project addresses reform of Earth Science education statewide through a series of collaborative partnerships between the University of Iowa, Kirkwood Community College, and the Iowa Geological Survey. Targeted activities follow National Research Council recommendations for Preparing the Next Generation of Earth Scientists and are aimed specifically at the K-12, community college, four-year university, and professional geoscientist levels to dramatically improve the opportunities and outcomes for student awareness of, engagement with, and professional preparation for a potential career in geoscience.<br/><br/>This project is working to dramatically reshape geoscience education in the State of Iowa through four mechanisms: 1) directly funding teacher training and re-certification courses through continuing education credits; 2) developing and disseminating K-12 course content materials for NGSS Earth Science content in the classroom; 3) engaging undecided and early career undergraduate students at the University of Iowa and Kirkwood Community College in the geosciences, through a series of field trip experiences and independent research opportunities; and, 4) providing internship opportunities as professional preparation for students who intend to pursue a career in the Earth Sciences. This project focuses on the critical transitions from K-12 to college, community college to four-year university, and university to the geoscience workforce. This integrated and systemic approach to strengthen Earth Science education has the potential to transform Earth Science education in the State of Iowa, as well as establish a model for effective implementation of the NGSS Earth Science components that may have utility in other states that have adopted the NGSS. By the end of the three year project, a total of 225 K-12 teachers will receive continuing education credits, more than 350 community college and four-year college undergraduate students will engage in a series of geoscience field trip courses, and 45 undergraduate students will participate in mentored research/internship opportunities."

Flooding is typically related to higher precipitation, but there is growing evidence that reduction of a river channel's ability to convey floodwaters as a result of sediment deposition can lead to more frequent floods and increased flood hazards.  Current flood models do not sufficiently resolve sediment dynamics in river networks and related consequences for channel conveyance. The overarching objective of this research is to improve our understanding and ability to forecast flood and landslide risks by targeting key uncertainties of sediment inputs to the system from landslides and debris flows and sediment dynamics in channels.

Landlab will be incorporated into an integrated flood modeling framework that includes distributed hydrology (DHSVM), and fluvial geomorphology and hydrodynamics (Delft3D) models. DHSVM will provide hydrologic forcing to Landlab, which will be used to model sediment flux  that is routed through the watershed by DHSVM and incorporated into  Delft3D for flood prediction. This modeling framework will be applied to Skagit and Puyallup Rivers draining two different sediment-laden stratovolcanos, Glacier Peak and Mount Rainier, in the State of Washington. The Skagit and Puyallup Rivers both have long histories of generating damaging floods linked to sedimentation processes. The modeling framework will be extensively validated with existing observations and remote sensing data to address the following questions: (1) What are the dominant geomorphic processes that lead to sediment supply and channel change in the study systems, and how they can be represented in an integrated flood model? (2) How do geomorphic processes, including landslides, debris flows and channel storage affect flood risk? (3) How will flood risk change in the future given expected changes in geomorphic processes? The integrated modeling framework will evaluate how processes interact over a range of temporal and spatial scales during and between flood events, shaping sediment dynamics, river conveyance, and flood frequency. Improved understanding of flood and landslide risks in these systems will provide valuable information for management decisions to address future flood risks and will be communicated via stakeholder workshops."

The population (exceeding 13 million) and infrastructure in greater Los Angeles are highly vulnerable to such an event. The benefits of previous ground motion predictions for large earthquake scenarios on the southern San Andreas fault are limited by deficiencies in the underlying simulation techniques as well as bandwidth. This project will use recent advances in available supercomputing resources and sophistication of numerical modeling codes to bring the simulations to a level that can be used for engineering design. The resulting ground motion models will allow improved seismic hazard analysis with realistic model features deemed to be important at the higher frequencies. The project will provide a first step toward significantly improved seismic hazard estimation, initially for a large event on the San Andreas fault in southern California. However, the results can be used in other areas where large earthquakes are possible in the future (e.g., northern California, western Washington, Wasatch Front, New Madrid Seismic Zone). The research is expected to enable refined predictions of peak ground motions for extreme events in the future, including the near-fault area where observations are sparse. If properly used, these results could affect current hazard maps and engineering design, and mitigate the loss of life and property in future large earthquakes.<br/><br/>Large-scale computational efforts for large earthquake scenarios on the southern San Andreas fault have shown significant variability of the resulting long-period (longer than 0.5 s) ground motion levels due to 3D basin effects. However, the long-period ground motions predicted from these studies have limited use for practical purposes, due to simplifications in the underlying ground motion modeling as well as computationally-imposed constraints on the frequency content. This project will bring the simulations to a sophistication useable for engineering design and seismic hazard analysis. The maximum frequency of previous ground motion models for large southern San Andreas fault events will be increased to 5 Hz with realistic near-surface velocities and include new model features deemed to be important at the higher frequencies, such as small-scale source and media heterogeneity, frequency-dependent viscoelastic attenuation, and site effects. The current engineering practice of site-specific hazard assessment still relies on 1D nonlinear (or equivalent linear) simulations to predict the response of soils. The project will develop models and computational strategies that integrate nonlinear soil response into 3D simulations, validate them using borehole array data, and apply the models predictively to large San Andreas fault scenarios. In addition, the research will investigate how surface waves contribute to amplification, and how this amplification is affected by nonlinearity and near-surface anelastic attenuation. The highly scalable GPU-based finite-difference code AWP and available supercomputing resources provide the foundation for the challenging computational aspects of the research. The project will complete on-going work on a discontinuous mesh capability to allow for lower near-surface velocities and higher frequencies in the simulations, accurate source insertion in a nonlinear medium, and refinement of 3D nonlinear rheology."

Thus, students from many colleges and universities leave undergraduate programs without the necessary educational products to successfully engage in geoscience employment or for attending graduate school. As a result of the multi-year effort on the Future of Undergraduate Geoscience Education (Futures), the skills competencies and concepts that students need to be successful in the current and future workforce have been defined and agreed on by both the academic and employer components of the geoscience community.  In addition to developing a consensus, the Futures effort investigated best practices for imparting these core needs to students and implementing changes within geoscience departments across the country. The current project will develop a Vision and Change document and toolkit for the geosciences that encapsulates all of the results and outcomes from the Futures effort. Department heads, chairs, and other administrators, faculty, students and employers will have access to the document and toolkit to guide systematic changes in geoscience education at the undergraduate level in the United States. The education of undergraduate students in departments that successfully evolve their programs will be greatly enhanced, and those students will be better prepared for graduate school and/or future employment.  The experiential learning recommended by the wider geoscience academic and employment community is also most conducive to learning by underrepresented groups and to their future success.<br/><br/>The Vision and Change document will make the case for the critical need for institutional change and provide guidance on best practices for achieving these changes for departments of different sizes and institution types. The current project will produce a suite of information products to be used as a tool set for deans, department chairs, and faculty in assessing their existing curriculum and guiding the priorities and strategies for modernizing their program to meet current and emerging needs. The Vision and Change document and associated products will provide critical data on the skills, concepts and competencies needed for undergraduate geoscience education and on effective strategies for updating undergraduate curricula and programs and in identifying common obstacles or roadblocks and solutions. Results from previous pilot studies at different institution types and faculty levels will be presented to help departments identify the approaches that would be most beneficial to them. Preparing students to be successful future geoscientists requires a solid understanding of current and future workforce needs and the evolution of curricula and programs to keep in step with the changes in geoscience research and technology.  Fomenting change in departments, particularly with respect to undergraduate curricula, can be a challenge and being able to design successful strategies for changing undergraduate programs in different types of institutions will be a significant advancement. The Vision and Change document will be a catalyst for change and provide a roadmap for proven pathways to success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The diversity of faculty in the geosciences remains far below the population as a whole, and this has an effect on attracting and retaining a diverse student body. In this work we focus on improving the retention of underrepresented faculty by using small groups comprised of junior URM faculty interested in broadening participation (BP) efforts (?sparks?), more senior partners in the same departments (?partners?) and experienced broadening participation experts (?sponsors?) to drive change. We acknowledge that an underlying reason for a lack of focus on broadening participation efforts might be the institutional environment, where there is little departmental motivation to recognize or reward BP efforts in tenure and promotion, leading to a culture that does not view BP efforts as important, and an environment where URM faculty do not feel supported. An effective way to tackle this problem is with small groups with appropriate leadership training who are empowered and supported in developing departmental plans for changing the culture of their own department; and application of grounded theory to gather data that supports ongoing change.<br/><br/>Part II<br/>Sparks for Change is centered on a three-day workshop, with follow-up support, that will build a network of scholars focused on broadening participation in the geosciences, provide faculty with the leadership skills necessary to lead a departmental culture change and support for them in developing individualized plans for enacting change. The workshop will bring together ten small groups, comprised of a spark, partner and sponsor, from a range of different institution types, for training in leadership, sharing of broadening participation strategies and practical goal setting. Ongoing support, including evaluation of efforts, development of resources and alliance building will continue to empower the groups to enact change upon return to their institution. Sparks for Change is novel in its incorporation of small group theory as a framework for this change, and will provide us with an understanding of the effectiveness of this approach as well as insight into effective leadership practices and a set of concrete means for changing departmental culture to recognize and reward BP efforts. The goal of the program is to build a network of leaders in BP, a collection of tested strategies for improving departmental support for BP efforts, and a growing number of geoscience departments that are better equipped to attract and retain URM faculty and students, ultimately leading to a more diverse geoscience workforce."

This phenomenon can cause users to strategically over-exploit groundwater in a ""pumping race"" that can accelerate its depletion. Unfortunately, few regulations address this tragedy of the commons because the underground nature of the resource makes it particularly challenging to monitor. This research seeks to estimate the extent to which strategic over-exploitation accelerates global groundwater depletion, and to identify new mechanisms to explain why groundwater is particularly prone to strategic over-exploitation, especially at jurisdictional boundaries. These new insights will be used to explore new regulatory approaches to curtail this behavior.  This research will benefit society by integrating hydrology, economics, and law to improve cooperation over shared groundwater resources. It will also provide interdisciplinary training for three graduate students and create valuable infrastructure that will be shared broadly with businesses and the public sector.<br/> <br/>Adverse selection is the tendency for markets to break down under asymmetric information, because uncertainties cause agents to attribute ulterior motives to other agents' willingness to make a deal. A similar mechanism likely arises for groundwater due to asymmetric hydro-geologic uncertainty. This research will test the hypothesis that adverse selection explains why agents do not cooperate over shared groundwater resources. The project has four components: (1) perform a global assessment of the role played by tragedies of the commons in the depletion of international aquifers; (2) derive a micro-economic model to investigate whether adverse selection can explain the dearth of international agreements on shared groundwater; (3) develop coupled human/groundwater models to investigate why cooperation has emerged in specific aquifers, through case studies in Europe and South America; and (4) investigate the potential for satellite data to attenuate information asymmetry and facilitate cooperation by averting adverse selection, focusing on a vulnerable aquifer identified in component (1).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenges stem from the fact that the issues of food, water and energy are often tightly connected with each other, not only locally but also globally. This is known as the Food-Water-Energy (FWE) nexus.  An effective solution to a local water problem may cause new local problems with food or energy, or cause new water problems at the global level. On a local scale, it is difficult to anticipate whether solutions to one issue in the nexus are sustainable across food, water and energy systems, both at the local and the global scale.  Innovative solutions that encompass the nexus are particularly important to enable cities to better manage their food, water and energy systems and understand the benefits and tradeoffs for different solutions.  <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 29-country initiative through the joint Belmont Forum- Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe.

This project addresses the need to increase public awareness about the importance and significance of geoscience research done by a diverse, dynamic group of researchers, and also addresses the need to attract and retain a more diverse population of young people to the geoscience fields by offering hands-on media training to college students and faculty that will increase their skills in public communication in this increasingly media-oriented world.  The PIs for this project are veteran earth science filmmakers Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, who have produced eighteen successful documentaries for broadcast on PBS and internationally, and many shorter geoscience focused videos, set in locations on every continent.  They have also mentored a number of geoscience students in media production techniques; some of these students have gone on to utilize these skills in professional positions.  In addition to creating a mechanism for developing and producing in a timely fashion both professional broadcast documentaries and student/researcher-produced videos about geoscience research this project will also provide a unique incentive to students from diverse backgrounds to participate in geoscience research projects and field camps/schools, and while in the field receive intensive media training from the PIs.  The trainees will not only have the opportunity to contribute content to a broadcast documentary and their own video production, they will learn a valuable skill in communicating science to the public using advanced production techniques, which will increase their competitiveness as they seek new positions, and ultimately broaden the number and diversity of geologists who can skillfully document important and exciting geoscience research activities and thereby increase the quality and quantity of accurate, credible media products about geoscience topics that raise public awareness of the relevance, importance, and need for geoscience research and knowledge.

To enable this, humanity must increase our understanding of the physical, biological and chemical processes occurring in the Critical Zone (CZ) that nurture human society globally. The CZ is Earth's surface layer between the top of the vegetation canopy and the base of groundwater.  Such understanding will help society to better adapt to and manage the effects associated with ongoing land-use and climate change. This proposal proposes to create an international Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) SAVI as an integrating activity for Earth surface geosciences research worldwide.<br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to address important and outstanding charges that challenge the U.S. CZO program: How can individual sites articulate and answer network-wide questions? How can the diverse CZOs make some measurements in a coordinated fashion at all CZOs? Proponents hypothesize that development of such measurements and questions requires focused leadership and a concerted effort that entails 5 years of workshops, graduate and postgraduate student mentoring, and targeted research projects that demand common measurements. They have proposed an approach to the development of international cross-CZO science, and to establish a new cadre of truly interdisciplinary and international scientists through graduate student and postdoctoral training. <br/><br/>This CZO SAVI will establish a framework to address major challenges that face humanity with respect to habitability of the CZ. This project will engage U.S. and international partners from diverse networks by: 1) learning to explore and measure the essential variables underpinning models of the CZ; and, 2) supporting a U.S. group of junior scientists to become the next-generation of international scholars of the CZ. In short, the project seeks to implement a cross cutting and coupled network of junior researchers working closely with the senior CZO leaders to promote understanding of the cross-disciplinary and coupled nature of CZ processes.

The STEM enterprise is strengthened by engaging multiple perspectives and utilizing the full talent pool available throughout the nation. Efforts to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented minority students in the STEM disciplines thus contributes to a vibrant, creative, and impactful STEM workforce for the future.  With more than half of STEM undergraduate degree recipients now beginning their educational pathway in a community college, it is essential that effective strategies for supporting students interested in STEM disciplines as they make the transition between two-year and four-year institutions be identified, in order to sustain the recruitment and retention of students in the STEM pipeline.  <br/><br/>Citrus College, in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) at the University of Southern California, and the Oak Crest Institute of Science, is implementing a cohort-based program to engage 20 minority undergraduate students per year (60 students total) in immersive experiences that will increase their interest in, and preparation for, continuing along geoscience education pathways. Students at Citrus College, a Hispanic Serving Institution, will engage in geomodules organized around the subfields of planetary, atmospheric, ocean, and environmental sciences.  These geomodules will include research activities with scientists at the collaborating research institutions.  A capstone 10-day mini-internship at UCAR will provide immersive atmospheric research, training, and fieldwork.  Professional development, mentoring, science communication development, and cohort-development is woven across all four geomodules.  Through these catalytic experiences, participating students are expected to deepen their interest in and knowledge of the geosciences, to better understand the multiple entry points into the field, and to build valuable professional skills and networks.  Engaging underserved populations through this project is expected to both increase the number of diverse students transferring to baccalaureate programs in the geosciences and create a more diverse population of science-literate citizens to address current and future geoscience-related challenges."

Given the steady U.S. population migration to urban centers, recruits will increasingly need to come from students who were raised in cities. The issues involved with recruiting urban geoscientists closely parallel those for recruiting from underrepresented groups. Many students and their families are unaware of the growing opportunities in the geosciences for careers that use advanced technology to solve some of the most challenging problems facing society. Urban geoscientists work on a wide range of local problems including waste management, flood control, beach nourishment, transportation infrastructure, land subsidence, and the environmental impact of ""fracking.""  To increase the size and diversity of the geoscience workforce and keep pace with demand in the 21st century, this project is testing new strategies, assessing what works, and sharing the model of an urban geoscience learning community with other universities.  New strategies include: developing materials highlighting career opportunities in urban geoscience, peer coaching in mathematics to assist students transitioning into science from other disciplines, and student apprenticeships to boost employment opportunities.  <br/><br/>The Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists initiative includes three main components. First, student recruitment is focused on developing career information for students and their parents to overcome misconceptions about opportunities. This information is being provided to prospective students during visits to the university, in general education and introductory-level courses in the department, and to the Alliance for Minority Participation on campus.  In addition to career information, service learning modules are being included in general education classes to inform students about applications for their new geology skills. Second, the Urban Geoscientists initiative is focusing on retention of new majors through a math-mentoring program. Math requirements are often a serious obstacle for students switching from non-science majors, and a reason many drop out of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors.  The Math Partners program is pairing junior and senior geology and environmental science majors who have completed at least one semester of calculus as mentors for newly recruited majors. New students are benefiting from one-on-one coaching by majors who have experienced their struggles and who can help them grasp the increasingly important connections between quantitative skills and careers in the geosciences. The mentors reinforce their own understanding of mathematics through teaching.  Working together also promotes camaraderie within the major. The third component of the project is focused on enhancing Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists through apprenticeship that prepare them for the workforce. This includes a new certificate program that teaches job skills, internship opportunities with local companies, and undergraduate research experiences working with graduate students and faculty. The creation of learning communities of urban geoscientists involving alumni, faculty, undergraduate students, and graduate students in both science and education strengthens the initiative and is an explicit goal of this project. Assessment tools are being employed to determine the efficacy and timing of intervention. Outcomes such as an increase in majors, fewer repeated math courses, and retention in STEM are being assessed by demographic groupings. Using Temple University as a model of urban geosciences, the findings of this project are expected to be important for nation-wide recruiting through application at other universities striving to recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for successful geoscience careers."

These objectives will be accomplished through the implementation of four components. First, courses at SOEST will be transformed to incorporate student-centered strategies (e.g. active-learning, targeted interventions to stimulate student learning and success) and innovative assessment tools. The second component is professional development opportunities for the students through participation in a mentoring network, workshops, and outreach activities. Another important component will be the establishment of the Geoscience Learning Center at SOEST modeled after the KCC STEM center. The Center will have dedicated staff and space to promote STEM learning, networking, collaborations, and shared sense of purpose. The last component is support for KCC ocean science program by developing an introductory oceanography laboratory course and offering fieldtrips to the KCC students.

As part of Binghamton University's Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program, a team of five science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty across the geology, biology and environmental studies disciplines are using the multi- disciplinary field of biogeochemistry to engage students early in their college years in research applicable to geoscience careers. Biogeochemistry investigates the interconnection of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Modern and ancient lake and ocean sediments, the atmosphere, watersheds and wetlands provide field sites and samples for the biogeochemistry research. The biogeochemistry research stream consists of a three course sequence: 1) a research methods course during the fall semester, 2) followed by training in analytical techniques during the spring semester that 3) culminates in completion of a research project the following fall.  Funding is being provided for some of the FRI students to engage in hands-on, outdoor, field based components of their research projects during the summer between the spring and fall. This approach allows students to develop projects that incorporate and evaluate seasonality components critical to the understanding of many biogeochemical processes.  As a part of the outreach program, high school educators and several of their students participate in a summer workshop where they learn about FRI opportunities through direct interaction with the FRI students, faculty and staff. In turn, the FRI students and their achievements are being used to develop an outreach program that includes visits to high schools and community colleges. Consequently, this program is working to increase the numbers and diversity of students trained in Geosciences, thus meeting a crucial national need within a STEM discipline.<br/><br/><br/>The Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program is supporting a cohort of 25-30 Biogeochemistry students each year. The biogeochemistry experience begins with a research methods course that emphasizes quantitative reasoning, scientific communication and a semester-long literature review to identify research topics in biogeochemistry. The first half of the spring semester, students learn analytical techniques applicable to biogeochemistry research; by the second half of the spring, they begin their research project. In the fall of sophomore year, students have an entire second semester to continue working on their research project. The biogeochemistry stream has a dedicated laboratory equipped for research, and a PhD-trained research educator who oversees the students, graduate teaching assistant and undergraduate peer mentors.  The FRI program features a combination of the multiple components. A team of faculty members with well-established research programs designs and oversees the freshman research themes.  The research themes explicitly address core concepts and core skills of the geosciences.  The participating freshmen develop electronic-portfolios documenting their research experiences and understanding of the process of science, which they build upon throughout their college years.  Students take a sequence of courses that emphasize teamwork, thus provides explicit training to undergraduates on how to work in research teams.  The students are exposed to interdisciplinary research (IDR) and engage in multiple opportunities to develop IDR skills. The biogeochemistry research projects generate spin-off research modules that are being infused into other courses; as a result, authentic research experiences eventually will be provided in regular science courses, contributing to improved engagement, learning and retention in the sciences. The undergraduates' research activities are expected to result in students being co-authors of presentations and peer-reviewed articles. Assessment activities are documenting the impacts of the stepped, multi-mentored research experience of the FRI program for undergraduates considering a career in geosciences."

The new generation of science students exhibits tremendous interest in direct application of their training for local and global good, and that ?bridge of relevance? is rarely adequately developed in the geosciences to take advantage of this passion. In an urban university like IUPUI, this new moral- and equity-driven student is one that is likely to be engaged in local transformation, more likely to be of economically, racially and/or culturally diverse background, and eager to serve their community. We will utilize several practices to engage students in this program, including a Thematic Learning Community to build confidence and support for students in the initial stage of their college career, a set of modules that will be developed in our majors courses that actively involve community-based examples of fundamental geoscience concepts, and the development and support of cohorts of Environmental Action Scholars, who will conceive and implement community-engaged projects in collaboration with our community partners. Collectively, these practices will institutionalize community-engagement and informed action in the geosciences, and thus provide relevance for students who might otherwise feel a disconnect between their geoscience classroom learning and their career goals. <br/><br/>Part II<br/>The overall goal of this project is to engage students from underrepresented backgrounds in the geosciences through targeted mentoring and extra-curricular community-engaged programs in the Indianapolis area. Project objectives include: Utilizing Thematic Learning Communities (TLCs) to enhance recruitment of, and a sense of belonging among, underrepresented students in the geosciences; Developing four hybrid classroom-field modules to diversify educational experience and increase content knowledge in a manner that provides application of theoretical knowledge in a societally-relevant urban context; Implementing community-engaged pedagogy and project mentoring to retain, support, and promote the holistic formation of underrepresented students as geoscientists by developing Cohorts of Environmental Action Scholars and providing externship opportunities for these students in the community. <br/><br/>The hypotheses that frame this work are (1) engaging science-interested but uncommitted students early and with mentor supports will enhance recruitment (both number and diversity), (2) providing practical place-based experiences that are linked to relevant societal challenges will personalize subject learning, and (3) supporting the implementation of topically-relevant projects in communities will provide the opportunities for learners to transition to experts. These hypotheses are developed on a theoretical platform of ""situated learning"" as applied to societally-relevant, and student-relevant, geoscience experiences.<br/><br/>Findings will be disseminated to the broader scholarly community, and will simultaneously be informing geoscience and other STEM educators on how to improve their STEM teaching and student learning, as well as the impact of this project and related pedagogical efforts on motivating students from underrepresented populations to pursue careers in the geosciences. Broader impacts for geoscience education include development, testing, and disseminating novel geoscience-impacts modules, determining the efficacy of interventions at several critical junctures that narrow the diversity pipeline in the geosciences, and providing opportunities for students to contribute meaningfully to community priorities in the realm of the geosciences, and thus to be better prepared for the modern geoscience workforce."

We will develop and leverage immersive learning tools that bring state-of-the-art sustainability science directly to >3,000 students, with the potential to scale to reach hundreds of thousands of students. Our educational approach combines interactive computer models with engaging role-play simulations, in which students learn for themselves by making decisions, and then finding out, through the computer models, how the Earth and energy systems are expected to respond to those decisions. In short, rather than being lectured to, students learn for themselves through a process that mimics scientific discovery. Further, our learning tools will take students ?under the hood,? to understand important Earth system processes and to gain a deeper understanding of the modeling process. Our project focuses on a student target audience that is currently under-represented in STEM: economically disadvantaged, first-generation-in-college students in federally funded TRIO Student Support Services programs. This focus will benefit the project by (1) leveraging and improving existing programs and networks for dissemination; (2) enhancing participation in the scientific enterprise by college students; and (3) enhancing the prospects of economically disadvantaged students.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Overview:<br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to broaden the pathway of low-income, first-generation-in-college students to the geosciences through development, implementation, and evaluation of scalable simulation-based climate and sustainability science educational tools. Our project team brings together expertise in climate and sustainability education (UMass Lowell Climate Change Initiative, or CCI, and Dr. McNeal), educational evaluation and research (SageFox Consulting Group and Dr. Newton), and leaders in advancing college access and success opportunities for low-income, first-generation-in-college students through federally funded TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) programs around the Nation (the Council for Opportunity in Education, or COE). Our goal is to significantly increase geoscience knowledge, interest, and motivation among early, low-income, first-generation undergraduate students. The three key project  components include: (1) Develop and test a new ?Geo-Interactive? curriculum that is centered on engaging simulation-based learning tools, uses an active learning approach to introduce climate and Earth system feedback processes, and makes direct connections to academic career opportunities; (2) Leverage the extensive nationwide network of 1,080 TRIO SSS programs that together reach >205,000 students to implement, propagate, and disseminate the Geo-Interactive curriculum to those currently underrepresented in STEM professions, careers or education pathways; and (3) Determine the impact of the Geo-Interactive curriculum on geoscience-related motivation, learning, and career interest.<br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The simulation-based curriculum we are proposing takes an approach that is supported by educational research: it is student-centered, experiential, and addresses a highly relevant, real-world problem. The proposed curriculum will include the World Climate simulation, which was co-developed by the PI and our project partners at Climate Interactive. Initial results have shown that World Climate delivers significant gains in climate literacy, systems thinking skills, and, importantly student motivation to learn and do more about climate and sustainability. By combining World Climate with new modules that explore geoscience concepts and academic and career opportunities, potential paths into geoscience will be opened for students whose engagement and motivation has been stimulated. Importantly, our target population are early undergraduates in SSS programs, a demographic that is under-represented in the geosciences and STEM more generally, and that has strong potential to broaden and diversify the Nation?s geoscience pipeline.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The proposed project is designed to benefit to society by: (1) contributing to the evidence base for effective educational approaches that reach all students, with a focus on students who have been underserved and underrepresented in the geoscience and STEM pipelines; (2) playing a role in closing the projected shortfall in geoscience professionals by broadening geoscience participation among more than 3,000 low-income, first-generation undergraduate students; (3) building a citizenry and workforce that is informed about and enable to make effective decisions in the context of global environmental change."

Sustainability science is an emerging field that addresses the challenges of meeting human needs without harm to the environment, and without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. A strong scientific workforce requires individuals educated and trained in interdisciplinary research and thinking, especially in the area of sustainability science. With the SEES Fellowship support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish herself in an independent research career related to sustainability. This project focuses on the sustainability of shelfish harvesting in Alaska.<br/><br/>In Alaska, paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by the marine alga Alexandrium is a severe and persistent problem that significantly impacts human health and the availability of shellfish resources. This project aims to enhance sustainability of commercial, recreational and subsistence shellfish harvest in Southeast Alaska by addressing the ecology of Alexandrium harmful algal blooms and their sociocultural impacts. <br/><br/>Despite the recognized impacts of paralytic shellfish poisoning, little research has been done on the causative organism, Alexandrium, and the sociocultural impacts of toxic Alexandrium blooms in the Southeast Alaska region.  This study is a three-pronged effort.  First, the project bolsters understanding of the ecological mechanisms that promote Alexandrium blooms by mapping cyst seedbeds (i.e., bloom initiation sites), monitoring cyst emergence, and identifying environmental conditions under which blooms form. This information adds to the body of scientific knowledge about Alexandrium bloom dynamics in coastal, fjord systems, provide early-warning information about toxic bloom development and help focus future paralytic shellfish poisoning testing and harmful algal bloom monitoring efforts in Southeast Alaska.  Second, the application of novel in situ sensors will overcome previous benthic emergence monitoring challenges and has the potential to improve harmful algal bloom forecasting capabilities. Third, human dimensions research will generate critical information about how social systems can reduce vulnerability to harmful algal blooms and how local/traditional knowledge can support scientific efforts by establishing strong community partnerships.

Currently accounting for over 50% of the nation's undergraduate population, community colleges are a crucial pipeline to the geosciences workforce. However, several barriers impact the recruitment, retention, and graduation of community college geosciences majors, including the diverse nature of students with respect to academic preparedness, economic standing, sense of support and awareness of career opportunities - making recruitment and persistence challenging for two-year geoscience programs.  To meet the employment demand, an increased number of students must enroll, persist and graduate from two-year geosciences programs. Suffolk County Community College (SCCC) proposes to address barriers to entry to geoscience careers through a new program, entitled GEO CORE (Geoscience Educational Opportunities & Career-Oriented Research Experiences), which will expand evidence-based pedagogical concepts to extracurricular activities in order to allow greater participation for majors and prospective majors of geology, marine, and atmospheric sciences. This project will build on ongoing collaborations by bringing the community college together with three regional high schools, Stony Brook University, the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey and private industry partners.

The goals of the GEO CORE project are to: 1) increase enrollment within the geosciences, particularly for students underrepresented in the disciplines; 2) enhance student learning experiences and outcomes; and 3) increase transfer rates and job placements to support regional workforce needs. Through the GEO CORE program, SCCC is instituting the following collaborative activities: 1) implementation of a summer institute for graduating high school and first-year community college students led by geoscience professionals and academics that incorporates research-oriented fieldwork experiences that highlight the interconnection between the geosciences and the regional environmental and economic concerns;  2) creating a GEO CORE Student Ambassador Program which prepares and supports second-year geoscience students who serve as peer mentors and academic tutors to foster success among first-year students; 3) establishing a career-based training program that includes hazardous materials training and certification to ensure that graduating geoscience students have the skills necessary for immediate employment and/or success upon transfer to four-year colleges and universities; 4) forming a community of practice for professional and peer networking opportunities among government agencies, industry, higher education institutions and high schools; and 5) encouraging the integration of GEO CORE activities into high school classrooms to serve as a bridge between secondary schools and the community college to help grow the geoscience education pipeline. Project success is being measured by comparing student outcomes to established baselines, and tracking the academic success, graduation, transfer, research experiences and career advancement of each annual cohort served by GEO CORE."

This project will investigate how urban watersheds can be improved through better stormwater management. The research will examine two watersheds in Washington, DC and Baltimore, Maryland that possess different degrees of urban decay and revitalization. It will compare the effectiveness of different interventions, both technical and social, at reducing unhealthy processes and feedbacks between the environment and people. Specific research objectives and activities are to: (1) document neighborhood issues and needs in informing stormwater best-management practices; (2) evaluate stormwater volume and quality, flooding risk, trash accumulation, and mosquito production within the watersheds; (3) develop a tool that uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to guide watershed management; and 4) enhance community awareness and positive behaviors to improve water quality and protect urban green space. This project will develop and evaluate practices that foster sustainable water resources and help educate participants, from teachers to students to all residents, many of whom are racial and ethnic minorities and socially, economically, and educationally disadvantaged, on processes and strategies involved in addressing water sustainability. It will train interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate students in interactive social, biological, and ecosystem sciences as they relate to water resources sustainability, neighborhood planning, mosquito ecology, and environmental justice. <br/><br/>This project addresses key biophysical and social drivers of nutrient pollution in watersheds, and the associated factors related to the socio-ecological matrix of the built environment, urban decay and revitalization, and resident attitudes and behaviors. Coupled stormwater-human dynamics have the potential to become a signature model for developing new socio-ecological theory about urban ecosystems, improving quality of life and environmental justice, and initiating sustained community-oriented management of natural systems. This project integrates the required expertise and theory from social science, city planning, hydrological science, ecology, adult and youth education, and environmental justice to explicitly characterize stormwater-human systems. This research combines socio-demographic measures of human behavior and stormwater quantity and quality to dynamically model pollution hot spots, assess the efficacy of interventions, and explicitly quantify the feedback of these variables. It represents an advance in the knowledge of coupled pollution-human dynamics in an urban context and provide valuable information for urban planning, remediation, and public health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing the number of students who start at a community college and continue to a 4-year degree in the geosciences can address this shortage. At Fort Lewis College, one-third of the 120 geology majors are transfer students, many of whom are first-generation college students, veterans, and/or Native Americans. However, these transfer students find it challenging to complete their degree in the expected two years after their Associates degree. This project is making it possible for transfer students to speed their time to graduation and enter the workforce in a more timely manner by supporting both their academic and social transition to a 4-year college.<br/><br/>This project is supporting the persistence and graduation of a cohort of Geology transfer students through their transition to Fort Lewis College (FLC), located in Durango, Colorado. The project consists of two groups of activities. (1) During off days within a 2-credit August field course, students go on field trips led by FLC faculty and meet with student support services on campus. The field trips allow the new students to meet faculty, reinforce skills and content knowledge from prior geology courses, introduce the new students to the local geology around Durango, and allow students to begin thinking about senior thesis projects that they could conduct with the faculty. The meetings with student support services help new students to navigate a new college; they include meetings with financial aid advisors, academic advisors, career services (including local geology alumni), cultural centers (Native American Center, El Centro de Muchas Colores), TRiO programs, student groups (American Indian Science and Engineering Socieity (AISES), the Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Geology Club, Women in Science Club), and local daycare and public schools. (2) Throughout the following academic year, students are supported academically, socially, and professionally through a series of activities. The students are supported academically and socially during their first semester by a senior geology major who serves as a tutor and as a connection to the social life of the department. They are supported professionally through funding to attend a Geological Society of America meeting and funding for senior thesis research.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is that it supports transfer students through a critical transition from a 2-year to a 4-year institution, and tests the effectiveness of field courses, tutoring, student services support, professional conferences, and undergraduate research funding in facilitating the academic and social integration of transfer students. The broader impact of this project is that, because Fort Lewis College is a Native-American-Serving, Non-Tribal College, a large proportion of Native American students (23% of incoming geology transfer students) and Hispanic students (11% of incoming geology transfer students) are being retained in a discipline that typically has a very low diversity."

In 2012, of 737 doctoral degrees awarded in the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, 319 were awarded to women, and only 35 were awarded to Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska-native students, combined. Substantial evidence exists to demonstrate the vital role that diversity plays in increasing innovation and creativity and increasing the quality of science, as measured by publication in high-impact journals and citation rates. By failing to recruit and retain diverse students, staff, and faculty in our field, we are losing the potential to create our best, most innovative science. Much of the shortcomings in recruiting and retaining minorities in geosciences seem to be related to the difficult social environments that these groups face in our disciplines classrooms and workplaces. We propose to develop and test a new professional development training for established scientific leaders in the geosciences ? the GOLD Institute ? designed to spark cognitive dissonance, and begin the process of personal reflection and change needed to transform existing leaders into champions for diversity. By targeting senior scientists who are already well-respected in the field, our project capitalizes on their reputations, networks, and social capital to build them into diversity champions with the power to make significant and swift cultural change in their institutions and the wider field. This proposal provides them with the training necessary to institute equitable recruitment, hiring, and promotion practices, and tackle ?chilly? and hostile climates. Nominations will be solicited throughout the geosciences several months prior to the GOLD Institute. Participants will be selected on the basis of scientific and/or educational expertise, potential to broaden participation in the geosciences, and other characteristics that exemplify effective leadership skills and behaviors. Selection for one of the GOLD Institutes is an acknowledgment that these individuals have established greater purpose and value in their work and are committed to a legacy of diversity and inclusion for the entire geosciences community.<br/><br/>Part II<br/>The overarching goals of the GOLD Institute are to develop senior geoscientists as leaders in diversity through allophilia ideals. Our cohort will begin their training at a two-day GOLD Institute, designed to spark cognitive dissonance, and begin the process of personal reflection and change needed to transform existing leaders into champions for diversity. We will work with the Knapsack Institute to develop this training, building on their many years of offering social-justice training through the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. Participants should be established and emerging leaders from a broad spectrum of the geosciences education and research communities, and they will have shown a willingness or eagerness to support diversity and inclusion efforts in the geosciences. Participants will be nominated by colleagues, especially previous students and mentees. <br/><br/>The research team will investigate how the guiding theoretical frameworks have influenced the change that occurs among participants. A goal is to provide explanations and supporting reasons for the best-practices that emerge from this project. The project team will employ mixed qualitative and quantitative methods to provide interpretations of the experiences, actions, and outcomes of the GOLD Institute utilizing the frameworks of allophilia, sensemaking, and systemic leadership. Specifically, the team will seek to understand how the senior scientists are able to make sense of their contexts to enact activities that are grounded in allophilia. In addition, these experiences will be used to understand how the GOLD Institute, along with the network of like-minded geoscientists that was formed during the GOLD Institute, impacted these experiences. Finally, special attention will be paid to the interactions of the geosciences with the activities of the GOLD Institutes to allow for interpretation of the potential for generalizing of the workshops across STEM to enhance diversity in all related disciplines."

Today, nearly 45% of all college students begin their undergraduate education at a community college; for underrepresented minority (URM) college students, the community college starting point is even larger (54%). These students are often underrepresented in the geosciences, underprepared academically, and burdened by unique obstacles due to socioeconomic status and family responsibilities. Few are aware of geoscience as a possible career.  If these students transfer successfully into a bachelor's degree program, they are often delayed in completion of their degrees because of inadequate math preparation and missing prerequisites, as well as the common necessity of working 20-40 hours/week to support themselves and their families. Many drop out of the pipeline, either because they are unable to complete the rigorous degree requirements or because they feel isolated and a sense of ""not belonging.""  Even if they complete their degrees, many of these students are first in their families to go to college and have little idea of how and when to plan for what follows graduation. To address these obstacles, this project is creating a seamless, supportive path from the time a student chooses a college major to when s/he enters graduate school or employment as a geoscientist. <br/><br/>This multi-campus partnership between Queens College, a 4-year college in the City University of New York (CUNY) system, and LaGuardia and Queensborough Community Colleges guarantees help for students from unusually diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds, regardless of where they first enter the education pipeline. Innovative strategies in this effort address transitions at four key points at which students make or confirm the decision to pursue a career in Geology or Environmental Science, or to drop out of the STEM pipeline: 1) Starting a geoscience career path at a community college; 2) Transfer from a 2-year to 4-year college; 3) Completing a rigorous geoscience major; and 4) Transition to graduate school or geoscience employment. Through customized workshops and outreach at the community colleges, students are building the skills needed for a science career and being provided with information about career options and salaries in the geosciences.  Coordinated multi-campus recruiting and advising by peers and faculty from all three campuses are helping students make strategic coursework choices that better articulate with the degree requirements at the 4-year institution.  A unique geoscience learning community spanning all three campuses is helping to make the transition from 2-year to 4-year seamless. New majors have an opportunity to mingle with advanced students and faculty from the Queens College campuses before and throughout the academic year at academic (colloquia, field trips) and social events. By the time they transfer from their community college, students know the Queens faculty and the best path to degree completion. Modest stipends are being provided that make possible a geoscience service-learning culture for superior students, saving travel to and from off-campus jobs unrelated to their career goals. Stipend recipients serve as teaching aides and tutors in introductory courses, helping others understand basic concepts while deepening their own understanding. Some tutees will become the next generation of geoscience majors and tutors. Because calculus is known nationally as one of the major obstacles to completing a geoscience degree, free tutoring is being provided by Time 2000, a Queens College initiative that trains students to become high school math teachers. To better prepare students for their lives after graduation, the project is offering a series of workshops, starting in the freshman year, that help individuals choose job or graduate school; write resumes, personal statements, and application letters; and learn interview skills.<br/><br/>The principal intellectual merit of this project is to test two innovative models for improving student engagement, academic performance, and retention: 1) a unique discipline-specific learning community spanning three urban campuses - two Associates (community college) and one Bachelor's-Master's college, and 2) a service-learning approach to engaging students that removes or lessens the need of financially challenged geoscience majors to work off-campus at jobs unrelated to their professional goals.  Although the ""Freshman Year to Geoscience Career"" project is designed specifically to increase the number and diversity of geoscience students at the participating CUNY system campuses, the problems it addresses are endemic and the solutions it offers can serve as a model across all academic institutions and disciplines."

Changes in climate will alter ecosystem structure and function, affecting the distribution of subsistence resources and access to the areas where resources are harvested. High fuel costs (e.g., heating, transportation) have forced rural households to make economic sacrifices to maintain and use equipment needed for subsistence. To address these issues, this project will: 1) document specific impacts that environmental change and energy costs are having on subsistence, 2) identify and link characteristics of the human (e.g., policy, household economics) and natural (e.g., climate patterns, landscape change) system that influence vulnerability to impacts, 3) evaluate the effectiveness of current responses to impacts, and 4) enhance communication networks among communities and researchers to foster future adaptation to globally-driven changes. Rather than considering global-change adaptation as a set of discrete actions, this research will treat actions as feedback loops that link social and ecological components at community and regional scales and will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks. The project involves collaboration with local communities as well as with federal, state, and tribal organizations in Alaska to develop and enhance networks that invent, test, and share adaptations at regional and larger scales. It will enhance capacity to adapt to environmental change in Alaska by engaging community leaders and training graduate students, many of whom are Alaska Natives, in an interdisciplinary research process. Of the 14-member project team, 21% are Alaska Native, 50% are women, and 43% are early-career scholars.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel framework (adaptive coupling) to study adaptation in social-ecological systems. It will integrates vulnerability and resilience science in a systems context. Rather than considering global-change adaptation as a set of discrete actions, it treats these as feedback loops that link social-ecological components at community and regional scales. The project will test the hypothesis that ineffective adaptation to global change results in part from weak or missing feedbacks from impacts on communities back to the local drivers or factors mediating community sensitivity to these drivers. The investigators seek to understand reasons for weak or missing feedbacks. The research will contribute to theory by integrating qualitative insights from the social sciences (especially related to political ecology and adaptive and collaborative capacities) with more quantitative information from ecology, hydrology, and economics within a systems framework. The dynamics and pathways by which adaptation scales from individual communities to a region will be investigated. In contrast to the literature on top-down diffusion of innovation from agencies to local entities, the investigators will focus on the grassroots emergence of novelty and factors that influence its regional diffusion. The focus on the interface between theory and practical application of knowledge in local communities has the potential to transform the western linear (loading dock) model of science to a more iterative adaptive approach that recognizes the intellectual value of local knowledge and the importance of real-world application as a learning laboratory."

As the number and extent of these lakes grows, so does the flood risk for communities downstream of them, potentially leading to extensive loss of lives and severe damage to transport infrastructure, hydroelectric power facilities and agriculture. This project will look at the factors that lead to GLOFs, and the measures that local populations can take to adapt to this increasing threat. <br/><br/>The research will capture unique knowledge of glacial lakes and the communities that live near them, sharing this with researchers and decision makers challenged by these problems in the U.S. and elsewhere.

We will do this by modifying the laboratory/recitation component of Math 1302 (College Algebra) by integrating geoscience research of The Ohio State University (OSU) and UTA faculty into the mathematics curriculum, reaching approximately 1,000 students per semester. Weekly lab meetings in the mathematics courses will incorporate a video presentation by geoscience faculty describing how the mathematical skill is essential for his/her scientific research, and exercises the students perform will be cast in the context of that research project, followed by problem-solving activities that synthesize mathematical concepts and apply the concepts with problems related to geoscience research. In this way, the mathematical abstraction will be connected with geoscience content crossing the fields of geophysics, environmental geochemistry, and oceanography. This is a strategic partnership, as the geosciences incorporate research methods from across all of STEM and are therefore likely to be relatable to a broad range of STEM-intended students. This collaboration will empower beginning STEM students by placing abstract mathematical concepts in a scientific context at a critical transition, which constitutes statistically a major stumbling block for many STEM-intended majors. At the same time, it will expose students early in their college experience to geoscience as a potential major. This project will be made possible by building a new partnership between the School of Earth Science at OSU and Mathematics at UTA. Success of the project will be determined by monitoring D-F-W rates of this course, evaluate students? perceptions of the geosciences and confidence in mathematics, and tracking students through declaration of their major and beyond.

Calculus is the first mathematics course in all natural science degree plans at UTA; however, Algebra or Precalculus are common mathematics entry points for STEM-intended majors especially those who begin their major through nontraditional pathways. In 2012, UTA had the highest acceptance rate and highest number of new transfer students (8,649) in the country (National Student Clearinghouse Research Center) and this trend continues. Given these statistics, and the fact that the proposed work will directly affect ~1000 students per semester, this project will have an enormous impact on a diverse population of at-risk students who aspire to graduating in a STEM degree.

Physically plausible mechanisms have been identified that could produce a rise in global mean sea level of 2 meters (> 6 feet) or more by 2100.  This amount is roughly twice the ""likely"" sea-level rise assessed by the most recent (2013) report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea-level rise of this magnitude would soon transform the potential for extreme flood risk in many coastal cities and communities, with the potential for devastating economic consequences and severe impacts on strategic infrastructure. While progress has recently been made in modeling the future response of the polar ice sheets to a warming atmosphere and ocean, substantial uncertainty remains and more work is needed to verify the potential for such extreme rates of sea-level rise. This project will use state-of-the-art glaciological theory, modeling, and observations of past and present ice sheet behavior to better characterize this uncertainty stemming from complex ice-sheet physics and interactions among the ice sheets, ocean, atmosphere, and the underlying solid Earth. It will produce new projections of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets' response to a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Advanced statistical techniques will be used to combine the new ice-sheet projections with other factors contributing to global and local sea-level change and associated coastal flooding, in order to produce both sea-level projections and time-evolving water-level probabilities along inhabited coastlines around the globe. The project will provide national and local policy makers and stakeholders with: 1) an assessment of possible levels of future sea-level rise, 2) the frequency (probability in any given year) of specific flood heights being exceeded, 3) an assessment of how those frequencies and storm-surge heights might evolve in the future, and 4) quantified measures of the uncertainty in the projections. The results will be disseminated widely through the development of easily interpretable and universally accessible web-based tools, in close cooperation with Climate Central, an established organization linking climate science and public communication. The goal is to provide the best possible toolkit for informed decision making in terms of coastal resilience and preparedness.<br/><br/>Predicting the future of the polar ice sheets remains one of the grand interdisciplinary challenges in geoscientific modeling. Previously underappreciated glaciological processes (hydrofracturing of ice shelves and ice-cliff collapse) have recently been incorporated into ice-sheet models, but further work is needed to quantify and calibrate these mechanisms, establish ranges of structural and parametric uncertainty, and identify climatic thresholds capable of triggering drastic and possibly irreversible ice-sheet retreat, particularly in the marine-based sectors of Greenland and Antarctica. Technical aspects of this project include extending a numerical ice sheet-shelf model with new processes (water enhanced crevassing, firn influence on supraglacial and englacial hydrology and hydrofracturing, ice-cliff collapse, mlange influence), more direct linkages among ice, ocean, and atmospheric model components, and two-way coupling with solid Earth-gravitational-sea-level models. Large-ensemble methods will be used to identify climatically driven instability thresholds and envelopes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and the ensembles will be statistically integrated with other global and local relative sea-level contributors including both non-climatic processes (glacio-isostatic adjustment, gravitational/rotational effects, subsidence/compaction, tectonics, land water storage) and climatic processes (mountain glacier loss, ocean thermal expansion, ocean dynamics, land water storage) to ""downscale"" the polar ice sheet results to the global network of existing tide gauge locations. Blending extreme value statistics of individual tide gauge time series with our new local relative sea level projections will provide a probabilistic assessment of time-evolving changes in storm-flood frequencies and return periods along global coastlines."

Gaps in the pathways to careers in geoscience begin as early as middle school?the last time many students encounter Earth science content in the classroom.  To address these challenges, this project will create opportunities for students in three diverse communities (Atlanta, GA; San Bernardino, CA; and Oklahoma) to develop their scientific skills and knowledge while working on authentic, local problems as they progress from middle school to college and beyond, into the workforce.   <br/><br/>Part II - The project design is informed by research findings that students are more engaged and invested in learning science when it is connected to issues of concern to their local community and that use of authentic, mentored, real world research experiences increase retention and persistence. Bringing together partners who have led relevant, successful national efforts with partners in the three regions the project team will design and begin implementation of inclusive pathways that lead from an early interest in Earth to careers that require geoscience skills and knowledge.  Each pathway will include multiple opportunities for students to 1) learn geoscience in the context of compelling local issues, 2) use geoscience to address local challenges, and 3) explore geoscience career pathways.  Experience gained by initial program partners and regional pilots will be used to create national support structures for developing integrated geoscience pathways and a collective action framework for expanded partnerships."

Recruitment and training of a diverse workforce of geologists and related scientists is critical for national health, prosperity, welfare and defense. However, recruitment of underrepresented minorities into geosciences faces many obstacles. This project employs novel high-impact educational practices to increase the number and diversity of geoscience majors entering the geoscience career pipeline and trains K-12 teachers to inspire their students? interest in geosciences. Underrepresented students and pre-service teachers will engage in innovative marine geoscience<br/>experiences, mentoring programs, and courses using exciting technologies, career opportunity exposure, and hands-on learning. This project will target and recruit underrepresented students into geoscience majors at a private liberal arts university and a Minority (Hispanic-Serving) Institution that has a high percentage of rural, low-income, first-generation students who have very little exposure to marine science. We will evaluate the impact of engaging exposure to oceanography on the recruitment and retention of geoscience students and the preparation of K-12 teachers. Under the mentorship of research scientists, students will conduct authentic research, advancing our understanding of marine resources and environmental changes on the Pacific margin of the U.S.<br/><br/>Part 2: <br/>The proposed project is an inter-institutional, co- and extra-curricular, participatory field-based oceanographic research program in collaboration with Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) to train and inspire diverse students to pursue careers in the geosciences. This program will integrate students from a private urban coastal campus (University of San Diego; USD) with generally rural, minority, low-income students from a minority-serving public inland campus, California State Univ., Bakersfield (CSUB), with established ?geoscience career pipelines? to bring high-school students into geoscience majors and place graduates with geoscience employers. We intend to examine the idea that a multifaceted approach including integrated marine science experiences in the lab, at sea and in the classroom can enhance recruitment and retention of students in the geosciences. This project builds on a successful program of shipboard education/research developed by USD and Rathburn. The broad goals of the program are to: 1) Increase oceanographic research and education opportunities at a minority-serving institution (CSUB); 2) recruit underrepresented students into geoscience programs; 3) engage geoscience majors, non-majors, and educators in shipboard and follow-up oceanographic research and internships in partnership with<br/>Scripps Institution of Oceanography; 4) enable students to conduct authentic oceanographic research using techniques employed by industry, government and marine researchers; 5) train pre-service teachers with mentors; 6) develop and test a virtual research voyage and exportable laboratory modules; 7) assess program efficacy and examine the influence of this approach on recruitment and retention; and 8) disseminate research findings. As a consequence of this multifaceted approach to sustainable geoscience recruitment and<br/>engagement, we will quantitatively evaluate the value and impact of: a) unique experiential learning at sea as a means to engage geoscience majors; b) oceanography and paleontology as means to attract non-majors to geosciences; c) the educational and recruitment/retention value of course integration with hands-on learning at sea; d) teacher/researcher mentorship and program<br/>engagement on pre-service teacher interest and competence in geosciences; and e) the use of sustainable marine educational materials as a means to engage teachers and attract students to geosciences. This sustainable project will: a) increase recruitment of diverse underrepresented students into the ?geoscience career pipeline?, b) improve interest, knowledge of career opportunities, preparation, and competency to enter and move through different stages of the GCP, c) generate novel curricula that incorporate authentic research and oceanographic samples into high-school and college courses, d) high-school teachers who have increased willingness, enthusiasm, and confidence to integrate geoscience research into their classrooms, and e) disseminate ?lessons learned? from this program which will contribute to the evidence base about novel, multifaceted approaches to increase students? interest, preparation, and success in<br/>geoscience careers."

In order to achieve success in these efforts, environmental institutions must be able to effectively communicate and engage with coastal communities and to attract new talent to the coastal workforce. Both of these endeavors will benefit from intentional actions that serve to identify and eliminate implicit bias within recruitment, retention, and promotion of new staff and in developing an inclusive work environment in which professionals from diverse backgrounds feel welcome. Among the ways that diversity in the workforce can have a positive impact on productivity and success are through competitive advantages, innovation, and new knowledge, skills, and perspectives involving the use and management of natural resources.<br/><br/>RAE proposes to conduct a DEI workshop during its National Summit. The workshop will focus on adding a DEI lens to recruitment and hiring in the coastal sector, including tips to cast a wider net in recruitment efforts, mitigate bias in hiring, and support retention and advancement in an inclusive work environment.

Physically plausible mechanisms have been identified that could produce a rise in global mean sea level of 2 meters (> 6 feet) or more by 2100.  This amount is roughly twice the ""likely"" sea-level rise assessed by the most recent (2013) report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sea-level rise of this magnitude would soon transform the potential for extreme flood risk in many coastal cities and communities, with the potential for devastating economic consequences and severe impacts on strategic infrastructure. While progress has recently been made in modeling the future response of the polar ice sheets to a warming atmosphere and ocean, substantial uncertainty remains and more work is needed to verify the potential for such extreme rates of sea-level rise. This project will use state-of-the-art glaciological theory, modeling, and observations of past and present ice sheet behavior to better characterize this uncertainty stemming from complex ice-sheet physics and interactions among the ice sheets, ocean, atmosphere, and the underlying solid Earth. It will produce new projections of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets' response to a range of plausible future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Advanced statistical techniques will be used to combine the new ice-sheet projections with other factors contributing to global and local sea-level change and associated coastal flooding, in order to produce both sea-level projections and time-evolving water-level probabilities along inhabited coastlines around the globe. The project will provide national and local policy makers and stakeholders with: 1) an assessment of possible levels of future sea-level rise, 2) the frequency (probability in any given year) of specific flood heights being exceeded, 3) an assessment of how those frequencies and storm-surge heights might evolve in the future, and 4) quantified measures of the uncertainty in the projections. The results will be disseminated widely through the development of easily interpretable and universally accessible web-based tools, in close cooperation with Climate Central, an established organization linking climate science and public communication. The goal is to provide the best possible toolkit for informed decision making in terms of coastal resilience and preparedness.<br/><br/>Predicting the future of the polar ice sheets remains one of the grand interdisciplinary challenges in geoscientific modeling. Previously underappreciated glaciological processes (hydrofracturing of ice shelves and ice-cliff collapse) have recently been incorporated into ice-sheet models, but further work is needed to quantify and calibrate these mechanisms, establish ranges of structural and parametric uncertainty, and identify climatic thresholds capable of triggering drastic and possibly irreversible ice-sheet retreat, particularly in the marine-based sectors of Greenland and Antarctica. Technical aspects of this project include extending a numerical ice sheet-shelf model with new processes (water enhanced crevassing, firn influence on supraglacial and englacial hydrology and hydrofracturing, ice-cliff collapse, mlange influence), more direct linkages among ice, ocean, and atmospheric model components, and two-way coupling with solid Earth-gravitational-sea-level models. Large-ensemble methods will be used to identify climatically driven instability thresholds and envelopes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and the ensembles will be statistically integrated with other global and local relative sea-level contributors including both non-climatic processes (glacio-isostatic adjustment, gravitational/rotational effects, subsidence/compaction, tectonics, land water storage) and climatic processes (mountain glacier loss, ocean thermal expansion, ocean dynamics, land water storage) to ""downscale"" the polar ice sheet results to the global network of existing tide gauge locations. Blending extreme value statistics of individual tide gauge time series with our new local relative sea level projections will provide a probabilistic assessment of time-evolving changes in storm-flood frequencies and return periods along global coastlines."

However, during the 2014-2015 school year, 37.6% of Alaska Native students dropped out of Alaskan public schools (education.alaska.gov/stats/). At the college level, Alaska Native students are underrepresented in University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) STEM majors. GeoFORCE Alaska is a four-year, field-based, summer geoscience program that has successfully raised graduation rates in rural Alaskan high schools and increased the diversity of students pursuing college degrees in STEM fields. The program applies the cohort model, leading the same group of high school students on 10-day field academies during four consecutive summers. The curriculum builds across the program, giving students a chance to apply the scientific method to relevant questions at spectacular geological locations. Now in its fifth year, GeoFORCE Alaska has served 54 students in two cohorts. 76% of these students identify as Alaska Native, reflecting the demographics of their communities. A stable base of industry sponsors funds one summer academy per year, limiting recruitment of a new cohort of 8th and 9th grade students to once every four years. By funding participant support for a second summer academy during 2018 and 2019, this expansion grant will double the frequency of recruiting and expand the region served, thereby offering the GeoFORCE experience to interested applicants in remote communities throughout northern and interior Alaska. Based on results thus far, doubling the number of GeoFORCE participants will raise high school graduation rates in the school districts served and increase the number and diversity of rural Alaskan students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Launched in 2012 by the University of Alaska Fairbanks in partnership with the longstanding GeoFORCE Texas program and adapted for a cohort of rural, predominantly Alaska Native students, GeoFORCE Alaska employs best educational practices as established by research in order to engage and prepare future STEM majors. Through a combination of active learning, high academic standards, mentorship and teamwork, participants acquire habits that promote academic success and gain the confidence to pursue STEM degrees. The goals of GeoFORCE Alaska are: 1) Promote high school graduation; 2) Increase the number of rural students attending college and pursuing STEM degrees; and 3) Diversify Alaska?s technical workforce. Program success in achieving these goals is assessed via qualitative metrics, including an annual survey of participants, and quantitative metrics, including participant retention, comparison of participants? high school graduation rates with rates for their school districts as a whole, and long-term tracking of college matriculation, persistence, majors, and degrees earned. <br/>The inaugural cohort of 18 students from the North Slope Borough completed the Fourth-Year Academy in summer 2015. 94% of these students graduated from high school and 72% are going to college. Of these, 85% chose STEM majors, and 38% will pursue undergraduate degrees in geoscience. A second cohort of 34 rising 9th and 10th graders entered the program in 2016. At the request of Alaska Native Regional Corporation sponsors, this cohort was recruited from both the Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs. On an exit survey following the 2016 First-Year Academy, 100% of participants indicated that they learned a lot, 97% made new friends, and 94% increased their interest in science. The success of the first two cohorts indicates that GeoFORCE Alaska is highly effective as a means of raising high school graduation rates in remote Alaskan villages and increasing the participation of rural, Alaska Native, and first-generation college students in STEM majors. An expansion grant will significantly increase the number of students and school districts served by the program over the next two years, with the goals of doubling the number of GeoFORCE alumni entering STEM majors by fall 2022 and attracting additional regional sponsors to sustain a biennial recruiting schedule.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Satellite imagery can help us map networks of rivers, study changes in the flow and thickness of glaciers, identify rock and soil types, and even find animals like penguins and seals. Because the availability of imagery in polar areas has increased rapidly over the last decade, we are now faced with a challenge: To move from small pilot-studies to pan-Arctic or pan-Antarctic analyses of geological and biological processes requires new infrastructures that link scientists, satellite imagery, and fast computing. The project, called ICEBERG - Imagery Cyberinfrastructure and Extensible Building-Blocks to Enhance Research in the Geosciences, aims to build the cyberinfrastructure required to make the most of satellite imagery for geosciences, starting with researchers working in polar areas, and then branching out to the larger community. The Broader Impacts of this proposal include the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as young investigators and female scientists. Moreover, the scientific findings enabled by this proposed cyberinfrastructure will have immediate benefits for our ability to predict the future dynamics of the polar regions, and critical to the management of Arctic and Antarctic resources. <br/><br/>Polar geosciences stands at the precipice of a revolution, one enabled by the confluence of cutting edge analytical tools, petabytes of high-resolution imagery, and an ever growing array of high performance computing resources. With these tools at hand, we can look beyond incremental improvements in our understanding of the polar regions. Near-real time datasets of geological and biological importance at the continental scale are within our reach if we create those critical cyberinfrastructure components that allow the geosciences community to exploit existing assets and establish a common workflow for reproducible imagery-enabled science. The research objective of this proposal is to understand the biological, geological, and hydrological functioning of the polar regions at spatial scales heretofore beyond the reach of individual PIs, and to develop tools for imagery-enabled science that can be applied globally. The resulting cyberinfrastructure, which we call ICEBERG - Imagery Cyberinfrastructure and Extensible Building-Blocks to Enhance Research in the Geosciences, is an extensible system for coupling open-source image analysis tools with the use of high performance and distributed computing (HPDC) for imagery-enabled geoscience research. We propose a project to (1) develop open source image classification tools tailored to high-resolution satellite imagery of the Arctic and Antarctic to be used on HPDC resources, (2) create easy-to-use interfaces to facilitate the development and testing of algorithms for application specific geoscience requirements, (3) apply these tools through use cases that span the biological, hydrological, and geoscience needs of the polar community, (4) transfer these tools to the larger non-polar community."

If so, how? 3) How predictable are S2S extreme precipitation events across temporal scales? and 4) How do we create an informative prediction of S2S extreme precipitation events optimized for policymaking and planning? To answer these questions, this project will for the first time, combine observations with novel machine-learning techniques, high-resolution radar composites, dynamical climate models (the National Multi-Model Ensemble and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5), and workshops that engage stakeholders in the co-production of knowledge. This project will identify the fundamental weather and climate processes that are tied to S2S extreme precipitation events across the U.S. from scales as small as individual storms to those as large as ocean basins. The prediction skill for S2S extreme precipitation events will be improved through an increased mechanistic understanding of historical events and a quantitative evaluation of model performance for simulating these events and their characteristic patterns. The statistical and co-production frameworks developed in this project will have the flexibility to be applied across meteorological extremes and timescales, in other global regions, with future climate model simulations, and with other stakeholder communities to reduce the impact of and increase resilience to extreme meteorological events."

Poverty has led to low educational aspirations and expectations that plague our entire community. As such, its disruption requires a collective effort from our entire community. Our Collective unites two local public colleges, 3 school systems, 2 libraries, 1 museum, 1 national laboratory and four local organizations devoted to youth development. Together we will focus on raising aspirations and expectations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) topics, for STEM deficiencies among 9th graders place them at risk of dropping out while STEM deficiencies among 11th and 12th graders preclude them from pursuing STEM majors in college and therefore from pursuing well paid STEM careers. We will accomplish this by training, placing, supporting, and assessing the impact of, an indigenous STEM mentor corps of successful undergraduate role models. By changing STEM aspirations and expectations while heightening their own sense of self-efficacy, we expect this corps to replenish itself and so permanently increase the flow of the state?s indigenous populations into STEM majors and careers ? in line with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science while advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>Our broader goal is to focus the talents and energies of a diverse collective of community stakeholders on the empowerment of its local college population to address and solve a STEM disparity that bears directly on the community?s well-being in a fashion that is generalizable to other marginalized communities. The scope of our project is defined by six tightly coupled new programs: three bringing indigenous STEM mentors to students, one training mentors, one training mentees to value and grow their network of mentors, and one training teachers to partner with us in STEM. The intellectual merit of our project lies not only in its assertion that authentic STEM mentors will exert an outsize influence in their communities while increasing their own sense of self-efficacy, but in the creation and careful application of instruments that assess the factors that determine teens? attitudes, career interests, and behaviors toward a STEM future; and mentors? sense of self development and progress through STEM programs. More precisely, evaluation of the programs has the potential to clarify two important questions about the role of college-age mentors in schools: (1) To what degree is the protege?s academic performance and perceived scholastic competence mediated by the mentor?s impact on (a) the quality of the protege?s parental relationship and (b) the social capital of the allied classroom teacher; (2) To what degree does the quality of the student mentor?s relationships with faculty and peers mediate the impact of her serving as mentor on her self-efficacy, academic performance, and leadership skills?"

This project is increasing undergraduate geoscience major recruitment through three mechanisms: 1) through partnerships with regional high schools and community colleges, and 2) through introductory geoscience classes by increased use of hands-on, active learning practices, and 3) through improved publicity about geoscience career opportunities, including teaching at the K-12 level. This project is improving retention through 1) academic advising at a program level to reduce barriers and foster learning communities, 2) developing peer networks, and 3) building of connections between Towson University (TU) geoscience students and the broader geosciences community. Cohorts of undergraduates engaged in faculty-mentored research serve as a core around which the geoscience programs at TU are being strengthened and grown. The cohort experience serves as a major tool to recruit and then retain students to geoscience majors. Undergraduate research experiences have been demonstrated to improve academic outcomes, interest in graduate school, and the percentage of students working in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)-related careers. An increase in the number and diversity of students entering geoscience careers will help meet workforce demands for the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>This project builds on existing best-practice methods for recruitment, student engagement, and professional development to increase the number and diversity of students entering geoscience careers. Faculty from TU and partnering 2-year community colleges (2YCs) and high schools are working together to publicize geoscience majors and career opportunities to increase recruiting into TU geoscience majors. TU and 2YC faculty also are seeking to establish transfer pathways into TU geoscience majors, since 42% of current incoming TU students enter as transfer students. Evaluation of the results of these approaches is advancing knowledge of methods to broaden pipelines for geoscience students transferring from 2YCs to four-year institutions and serves to inform other institutions working on these transitions. Qualitative research of student experiences offers insights into which best-practice methods are most effective and why. This project will contribute to the relatively thin literature on extracurricular geoscience research experiences for students. By the end of the project, at least 18 students will be affected directly through the research cohorts.  In addition, tens of students per academic year will be reached through the field trips and >500 students per year will be reached through recruiting efforts and pedagogical reform of introductory geoscience courses. Smoothing pathways from 2YCs to TU for transfer students will reduce the time students spend in college and the financial costs they incur, including students pursuing secondary teaching certification in Earth-Space Science. Underrepresented group participation in TU geoscience programs will be increased through recruitment from 2YCs with a higher percentage of minority students than TU and through the selection process of the cohort program, where consideration will be given to diversity and academic performance."

Within the coming decade, our nation faces a shortage of approximately 135,000 skilled geoscientists who are able to address these problems. Active recruitment of students into the geosciences is essential to meet this projected shortfall. Urban centers, such as Chicago, provide large populations of high school and community college students who reflect the socioeconomic and ethnic diversity of the nation, and therefore provide a rich source for recruitment of a diverse geoscience workforce. However, these students do not typically consider geoscience as a career. They often lack educational opportunities in geoscience, and in their daily lives, urban students interact more with the built environment rather than the natural world. They do not view geoscience as a possible career path and their families are unfamiliar with the discipline. Compelling and innovative approaches are needed to attract urban students, and in particular underrepresented minorities, into the discipline. The aim of this project is to expose high school, community college, and college students from the Chicago region to the aspects of geoscience that shape their world and are essential to the economic viability and sustainability of their future.  The ultimate goal is to increase the number of students who choose the field of geoscience as a major with the intent of continuing in geoscience as a career. Research results from this project will contribute to the evidence base for differing instructional models and transitional pathways that target high school and community college students.  Longitudinal evaluation of the project will investigate the overall ability to attract and retain those students as geoscience majors at 4-year institutions. Broader project goals are to achieve new institutional awareness of the importance and value of geoscience in the education and training of STEM-oriented students and to establish model approaches for engaging students and accelerating graduation rates that can be extended to more Chicago area institutions and other urban-serving institutions in the future.<br/><br/>The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is a public research and underrepresented minority-serving university in downtown Chicago that draws its enrollment largely from the urban area. UIC is partnering with five regional high schools and two local community colleges, where underrepresented minority students constitute 33 to 99% of the enrollment. Only two of three high school partners in the Chicago Public Schools district (Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy, Lincoln Park High School, and North-Grand High School) offer environmental science, and none offers geoscience classes. Maine East and Maine South high schools in suburban Park Ridge, Moraine Valley Community College, and Prairie State College offer introductory geology courses, all of which could launch students into the 4-year major at UIC. Project objectives are to 1) develop and implement dual enrollment courses and summer workshops at UIC that introduce students to urban-relevant geoscience; 2) coordinate with all partner institutions to establish clear transfer agreements and academic advising to reduce the time and cost of completing a 4-year degree in the Earth and Environmental Sciences major at UIC; 3) provide more interactions between students and faculty, through mentoring, recruitment visits, departmental open house events, and geoscience informational materials; and 4) assemble additional partners including families and local employers to help support students through their degree. Students participating in the program are expected to gain improved knowledge and attitude towards the geosciences, be prepared to succeed academically at UIC, and be supported by a network of peers, faculty, family, and employers. Faculty are becoming more adept at advising students in urban geoscience career options, and in implementing practices that help underrepresented groups overcome barriers to success."

These issues have potential impacts on all populations, however many minority groups continue to be proportionally underrepresented in geoscience related professions in academia, government and the private sector. In order to help close this persistent diversity gap within the geosciences, this project seeks to build a partnership between Tennessee State University (TSU), Vanderbilt University (VU), several federal, state and municipal government agencies, and the private sector with the goal of strengthening the pathway for minority students entering geoscience careers and graduate programs. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), like TSU, have a strong track record in recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM programs. However, only two of the 82 HBCUs have undergraduate geoscience programs. Thus, HBCUs represent a significant, underutilized opportunity to recruit diverse students into the geosciences. TSU has recently developed an Environmental Sciences concentration that does not currently include geoscience. VU is a research institution with a strong geoscience department with an institutional commitment to increasing diversity in all fields. The TSU-VU Partnership leverages TSU's strong record of preparing minority students for STEM careers and VU's vibrant geoscience research environment to draw students from underrepresented groups and prepare them for the geoscience workforce. To recruit, train and retain minority geoscience students, the partnership focuses on classroom and experiential learning to build the intellectual foundations and professional connections needed for successful geoscience careers. Upon completion of the program, students will be eligible and competitive for internships with program partners including Tennessee State Parks, the USGS, and several local businesses. Many of these internships involve direct interaction with the public, allowing the students to serve as role models of minority geoscientists. Thus, this program will work to increase the diversity of the geoscience workforce, change public perceptions of geoscientists and demonstrate the value of geoscience careers in the community.<br/><br/>The proposed TSU-VU Partnership has high potential to be transformative in the lives of the individual students involved, the relationship between two neighboring institutions, and the perception of geoscientists and geoscience careers in Tennessee and beyond. This 2-year program targets TSU Environmental Science students in their junior and senior years. Key program components during the first year include an introductory geology course taught by VU faculty at TSU, an intensive two-week summer field course investigating the geology of Tennessee state parks and an 8-week paid research internship in a VU or TSU lab. Year two supports advanced skill development through upper level coursework at VU and a Career Seminar to help the students determine the geoscience career pathways that best fit their goals. The program will be evaluated via a mixed methods approach to measure program and participant success. Through these evaluations, the program effectiveness will be documented and refined. A main product of this effort will be the construction and dissemination of a translatable model, or toolkit, designed to help institutions create and sustain partnerships at the undergraduate level. This toolkit will be particularly useful for other HBCUs wishing to partner with local or regional institutions to promote geoscience education. In this way, this partnership can be the start of a larger movement that promotes cross-institutional and agency collaboration to provide crucial support for students at key transitional moments in their careers and therefore to enhance diversity in the career and academic pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The geosciences make fundamental contributions that underpin a number of societally-relevant issues, including energy and natural resource development, sustainability, and mitigation of natural hazards. This project is addressing an anticipated shortfall in the number of geoscientists in the STEM workforce, as well as increasing STEM literacy in the populace through improving geoscience teacher training in Nebraska. Given the diverse populations available in this EPSCoR-eligible state, the project is especially focused on engaging, recruiting, and retaining students from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, in order to broaden participation of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM education and career paths.  Collaboration with smaller colleges in the region that do not have teacher-education programs in geoscience education is building capacity among the STEM teaching community in the state.<br/><br/>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, in collaboration with Concordia University, Midland University, Peru State College, Creighton University, and the Lincoln Public Schools, among other institutions, is undertaking a suite of activities aimed at improving geoscience student recruitment, retention, and career readiness, including undergraduate students who are pursuing careers as geoscience teachers.  An immmersive 16-day inquiry-based geology field course for pre-service teachers from colleges that do not offer Earth Science endorsements provides authentic scientific experience and training.  A summer bridge program for students between high school and freshman year, which includes both a shorter field-based activity and on-campus activities, exposes students at critical transition points in their education pathway to career opportunities in the geosciences.  Targeted recruitment at public schools that have highly diverse student enrollments is supporting efforts to increase diversity in the geosciences and related STEM disciplines.  Incoming freshman are recruited into the Geoscience Learning Community, which provides community support, mentoring, and networking opportunities.  Students in the learning community are recruited and supported as ""Learning Assistants"" who help instruct introductory geoscience classes and engage as experts with other students; this activity has been adapted from a successful model established at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Support for students to engage in research and internship projects and professional development is geared towared preparing students for a range of STEM careers, including teaching.  The project is also developing a toolkit of effective inquiry-based and discovery-learning teaching practices."

These issues have potential impacts on all populations, however many minority groups continue to be proportionally underrepresented in geoscience related professions in academia, government and the private sector. In order to help close this persistent diversity gap within the geosciences, this project seeks to build a partnership between Tennessee State University (TSU), Vanderbilt University (VU), several federal, state and municipal government agencies, and the private sector with the goal of strengthening the pathway for minority students entering geoscience careers and graduate programs. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), like TSU, have a strong track record in recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM programs. However, only two of the 82 HBCUs have undergraduate geoscience programs. Thus, HBCUs represent a significant, underutilized opportunity to recruit diverse students into the geosciences. TSU has recently developed an Environmental Sciences concentration that does not currently include geoscience. VU is a research institution with a strong geoscience department with an institutional commitment to increasing diversity in all fields. The TSU-VU Partnership leverages TSU's strong record of preparing minority students for STEM careers and VU's vibrant geoscience research environment to draw students from underrepresented groups and prepare them for the geoscience workforce. To recruit, train and retain minority geoscience students, the partnership focuses on classroom and experiential learning to build the intellectual foundations and professional connections needed for successful geoscience careers. Upon completion of the program, students will be eligible and competitive for internships with program partners including Tennessee State Parks, the USGS, and several local businesses. Many of these internships involve direct interaction with the public, allowing the students to serve as role models of minority geoscientists. Thus, this program will work to increase the diversity of the geoscience workforce, change public perceptions of geoscientists and demonstrate the value of geoscience careers in the community.<br/><br/>The proposed TSU-VU Partnership has high potential to be transformative in the lives of the individual students involved, the relationship between two neighboring institutions, and the perception of geoscientists and geoscience careers in Tennessee and beyond. This 2-year program targets TSU Environmental Science students in their junior and senior years. Key program components during the first year include an introductory geology course taught by VU faculty at TSU, an intensive two-week summer field course investigating the geology of Tennessee state parks and an 8-week paid research internship in a VU or TSU lab. Year two supports advanced skill development through upper level coursework at VU and a Career Seminar to help the students determine the geoscience career pathways that best fit their goals. The program will be evaluated via a mixed methods approach to measure program and participant success. Through these evaluations, the program effectiveness will be documented and refined. A main product of this effort will be the construction and dissemination of a translatable model, or toolkit, designed to help institutions create and sustain partnerships at the undergraduate level. This toolkit will be particularly useful for other HBCUs wishing to partner with local or regional institutions to promote geoscience education. In this way, this partnership can be the start of a larger movement that promotes cross-institutional and agency collaboration to provide crucial support for students at key transitional moments in their careers and therefore to enhance diversity in the career and academic pipeline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This short-circuits these students' ability to participate in more intellectually demanding, rewarding, and lucrative geoscience careers, and limits the potential for universities to meet the projected future demands for the nation's geoscience workforce. To address this issue, the RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) summer program will form a multi-institutional alliance among the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), Southern Utah University, Kutztown University (Pennsylvania), state/federal agencies in Missouri, and the private sector. The goal of RiGs is to (i) facilitate exposure of financially challenged STEM students from rural areas, at minimal to zero costs, to a wide array of geoscience career pathways, and (ii) to highlight the educational tracks and professional skills necessary to pursue those tracks. The RiGs program will provide an academic and professional development opportunity for financially challenged undergraduate students that these students would normally forego, thus serving as a pilot for increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. through rural workforce development.<br/> <br/>RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) will establish a recurring two-month summer program on the Missouri S&T campus that will help undergraduate students to successfully transition into the post-baccalaureate geoscience workforce. The focus is to immerse the students into an active research and/or private sector work environment that will allow them to develop academic and professional skills typically not taught in the classroom. Students will learn these skills through an Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class, a mentored research project or job shadowing at state/federal agencies in Missouri, and a series of extracurricular activities. The Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class is designed to provide context for the active, hands-on learning of practical skills applicable to geoscience research. As part of individual research projects, the students will be paired with Missouri S&T graduate students to guarantee full immersion into an active graduate research environment (i.e., the ""Grad School Experience""). Job shadowing at the US Geological Survey, the US Forest Service, and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources will provide participating students with unique insight into the daily life of a professional geoscientist, which will be complemented by a career day at the Doe Run lead mining company in Missouri.

Recruiting, retaining, and graduating undergraduate students in STEM disciplines, like geoscience, is a major challenge especially at Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs). The Lake Watershed Geosystems Path (LWGP) directly responds to these local and regional mandates while helping meet national needs to augment the geoscience trained workforce. Students learn scientific concepts quicker and more permanently when the concepts are provided as relevant applications. This project uses this educational principle of a problem-based, field-intensive, applied interdisciplinary science approach and seamlessly scaffolds it into existing curriculum and research opportunities. It also includes faculty and peer mentoring and links participants to applied geoscience internships and career opportunities. <br/><br/>The Lake Watershed Geosystems Path (LWGP) project seeks to increase STEM preparation and graduates in the following ways: 1) partnering with the Plymouth State University Admissions to recruit a diverse cohort of first-year students in STEM fields, 2) encouraging participating students to enroll in a newly created first-year seminar course that develops critical thinking through a geoscience lens, 3) engaging students in extracurricular field- and lab-based research as part of a new PSU Cluster project which spans the major hydrological components of watershed systems, including atmospheric deposition, land surface runoff, stream flow, and resulting effects on lake basins, and 4) assisting participating students in entering into pre-arranged internships and externships which leverage their newly acquired geoscience training. LWGP alumni will be recruited to help peer mentor and train subsequent participants via a 1-credit independent study elective. Ultimately, LWGP will blend field and laboratory student experiences oriented around hydrologic pathways in lake watersheds with community partnerships and faculty/peer mentoring to: 1) introduce geoscience principles, systems thinking and skill development at the onset of student university experiences; 2) increase student retention and success in non-geoscience degree programs that serve as pathways into geoscience fields; 3) foster strong cohort identification, and 4) apply knowledge and skills gained by students in this project to enhance their future work experiences, education goals, and career objectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impending shortage is particularly acute for careers in the geosciences, where it is anticipated there will be a deficit of 90,000 professionals by the year 2024. There are multiple reasons for this, but paramount among them is the aging out of professional geoscientists through retirements, and low awareness of geoscience career opportunities and financial opportunities among college freshman because rigorous geology courses are not commonly taught in secondary schools. Yet, students who discover a geoscience major at the university have very high satisfaction with their degree and the prospects of careers in the management of natural resources and mitigation of human impacts on the environment. Project EXPLORES (EXPLOration of Recruitment of Earth Scientists) is looking to address many of these issues through a combination of recruitment, curricular changes in a course taken by nearly all STEM majors at Northern Arizona University (NAU), near-peer and research mentoring, career advising, and a welcoming social and educational environment in the Geology Program. The project aims for at least an average 10% growth per year in the number of new students entering the geology major at NAU.<br/><br/>Project EXPLORES takes multiple actions to improve student understanding of the geology major and career opportunities in the geosciences. The basis of our project is a collaboration among faculty from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the School of Earth and Sustainability to develop several new geoscience-focused labs in a chemistry foundational course taken by 2000 STEM majors each year, including 30-40% of students from underrepresented groups. The labs will expose early-career STEM majors to how geoscientists use chemistry to quantify and understand changes in the Earth system. After the project ends the new labs will be institutionalized as a permanent part of the Chemistry curriculum.<br/><br/>To those students who show interest in the geoscience major the project will offer experiences that build their exposure to the major and careers after graduation. The experiences include:pairing geology undergraduate peer mentors (Geoscience Ambassadors) with prospective students to provide information about the geology major and their experiences in classes and with faculty; leading day-long field trips to local, spectacular geologic settings so prospective majors can learn how geoscientists incorporate experiential learning into classes; inviting career geoscience professionals to talk about their career paths and opportunities, as well as provide advice about which courses of study to pursue within the major; providing prospective majors and their research mentors stipends to conduct authentic research in one of our cutting-edge research groups that include climate science, geochemistry, geophysics, tectonics, and biogeoscience. Research mentors comprising graduate students and faculty will receive multi-day training on effective mentoring practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although slow progress in broadening participation in some STEM disciplines is being made, the geosciences community still has a long way to go before the number of African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and persons with disabilities are earning degrees and pursuing careers in the geosciences at a level that is consistent with their demographic representation.  Both recruitment of new underrepresented minority (URM) students into STEM majors and retention of those students who are already in the education and career pipeline are needed to make progress on this goal.<br/><br/>The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP) are implementing a 3-year program to provide virtual and on-site professional development, networking, community building and mentoring activities to 45 URM students who have participated in geoscience-related Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Site programs. The goals of this program are focused on retention of students who have already demonstrated an interest in the geosciences, but who are at risk of leaving the field because of isolation, lack of role models, and lack of mentors who can help guide them to the next stages of their professional success. The ""Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success in GEO REU"" (MS PHD'S-GEO REU) program builds on a successful pilot effort, leveraging previous NSF investments to build model programs for recruitment, retention, and leadership development of traditionally underrepresented students in STEM disciplines.  The program uses evidence-based mentoring concepts that are rooted in the theories of situated learning and authentic learning.  Career exposure and professional socialization activities are embedded.  A rigorous recruitment, application, and selection process is being used to identify three cohorts (15 each) of students from a national pool of REU Site participants.  The program involves two main phases: 1) on-site mentored professional development in conjunction with the annual Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union; and 2) virtual and face-to-face mentoring and networking at discipline-specific conferences, supported by on-going virtual professional development webinars. Formative and summative evaluation components are included in the project design.  Impact evaluation studies will investigate whether students participating in the MS PHD'S-GEO REU program show greater persistence in STEM and the geosciences, as well as more informed career decision-making, compared with other REU students who are not selected for the program."

This particularly applies to students from rural areas who are the first in their family to attend college. These students are often academically gifted, but feel that they have to enter the workforce directly upon graduating with a BS degree, often due to financial hardship. This short-circuits these students' ability to participate in more intellectually demanding, rewarding, and lucrative geoscience careers, and limits the potential for universities to meet the projected future demands for the nation's geoscience workforce. To address this issue, the RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) summer program will form a multi-institutional alliance among the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), Southern Utah University, Kutztown University (Pennsylvania), state/federal agencies in Missouri, and the private sector. The goal of RiGs is to (i) facilitate exposure of financially challenged STEM students from rural areas, at minimal to zero costs, to a wide array of geoscience career pathways, and (ii) to highlight the educational tracks and professional skills necessary to pursue those tracks. The RiGs program will provide an academic and professional development opportunity for financially challenged undergraduate students that these students would normally forego, thus serving as a pilot for increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. through rural workforce development.<br/> <br/>RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) will establish a recurring two-month summer program on the Missouri S&T campus that will help undergraduate students to successfully transition into the post-baccalaureate geoscience workforce. The focus is to immerse the students into an active research and/or private sector work environment that will allow them to develop academic and professional skills typically not taught in the classroom. Students will learn these skills through an Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class, a mentored research project or job shadowing at state/federal agencies in Missouri, and a series of extracurricular activities. The Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class is designed to provide context for the active, hands-on learning of practical skills applicable to geoscience research. As part of individual research projects, the students will be paired with Missouri S&T graduate students to guarantee full immersion into an active graduate research environment (i.e., the ""Grad School Experience""). Job shadowing at the US Geological Survey, the US Forest Service, and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources will provide participating students with unique insight into the daily life of a professional geoscientist, which will be complemented by a career day at the Doe Run lead mining company in Missouri. Furthermore, extracurricular activities throughout the summer program (team building exercises, mock job interviews, oral presentation skill development) will help students acquire the necessary professional and social skills for a successful geoscience career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the number of Latinx students attending WSU had risen, participation in STEM fields lags, and despite a growing demand for qualified geoscientists, many students entering WSU are first-generation college students who do not have family traditions in STEM fields. To overcome these challenges, this project will develop pathways to geoscience careers that integrate varying combinations of early outreach to high schools, early collaborative research, student cohorts, community engaged learning, and multiple pedagogies to support varied learning styles. Specific activities include: a Geoscience concurrent enrollment class taught in collaboration with high school teachers that incorporates project-based learning activities and promotes early recruitment; a summer bridge program that helps with a transition to college; community-engaged learning in an environmental geoscience course; a summer research program where students conduct collaborative projects centered around a newly developed Great Salt Lake field observatory; and student cohorts who take a structured sequence of core classes, including a new sophomore-level class that emphasizes work-force skills and career planning. Student successes and attitudes will be assessed at multiple points to evaluate what combinations and timing of activities best enhance recruitment, retention, and professional socialization of underrepresented groups. Two pathways will be compared: one in which students enter the pipeline earlier in high school and have a summer bridge experience; and a second where students are recruited from college courses.

The primary goal of the proposed program is to provide URMs in the geosciences academic/career pipeline supplemental professional training to enhance the quantity and quality of internship/fellowship applications such that greater numbers of URMs are selected for these educational and professional experiences, ultimately aiding their transition to the geosciences workforce through acquisition of both technical and non-technical skills coveted by employers. A critical aspect of this experiment will be to track progress of URM participants and their success rate being selected for internships/fellowships as a consequence of participation in the proposed workshops. Project personnel are uniquely positioned to monitor this population over the next three years to determine how well they perform at this task and how they progress through the pathways to the national geoscience workforce. It is anticipated the project will support at least 40 participants annually (minimum of 120 over 3 years). Participants will be supported for 2nd and 3rd year experiences in an effort to greatly increase their retention and persistence in GSA and, by extension, the geosciences profession. Recurrent counseling, mentoring, education, training, and engagement with this cohort will help them establish a sense of community and belonging within the geosciences.

This program represents a collaboration between the University of California, Riverside (UCR), Riverside Community College (RCC), and the Riverside Unified School District (RUSD), with engagement opportunities for additional community colleges and public school districts in the region. The American Geosciences Institute predicts that the geoscience workforce faces a potential shortfall of ~135,000 by the year 2020 unless recruitment rates are improved. The GEODE Program addresses this potential shortfall by focusing recruitment on communities that are historically underrepresented in the geosciences and thus represent an untapped pool of intellectual capital. Riverside County, located east of Los Angeles County in Southern California, is densely populated (2.3 million), highly diverse (47.4% Hispanic), and home to a wide range of geoscience career opportunities, and is therefore an ideal region in which to recruit new geoscientists.<br/><br/>The GEODE Program has two goals: (1) To create a range of programs designed to increase the number of underrepresented minority students in the geosciences and successfully usher them into the geoscience workforce, and (2) To test the efficacy of these programs in order to determine which programs should be used to increase recruitment and retention of new geoscientists from underrepresented minorities in other regions and by other institutions. The GEODE Program is increasing the recruitment and retention of a highly diverse and academically prepared workforce by increasing awareness of career opportunities in the geosciences and improving students' transitions through three critical educational junctures: (1) High School to College (2-Year and 4-Year), (2) Community College to University, and (3) University to Workforce. At each critical juncture, the GEODE Program is creating opportunities for students to be exposed to the wonders of the natural world through a multitude of field and research experiences.  The program also provides students with mentors, academic support and professional development programs to ensure retention and success. By leveraging the success of existing support programs at UCR for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students from underrepresented backgrounds, the GEODE Program is creating a geoscience network throughout its collaborating institutions."

Additionally, two PCC faculty have taught geoscience courses at UA. Despite course alignment and shared faculty, transfer students are often under-prepared in coursework, unsure of UA degree requirements, uncertain about job prospects, and concerned about financial support. Transfer students are also less likely to have occupational mobility after receiving their undergraduate degree because of their family commitments. These challenges are being addressed by establishing a recruiting, mentoring and internship program for transfer students. UA students are reaching out to prospective transfer students by leading field trips and by participating in PCC classroom activities. New transfer students are participating in two new workshops on professional skills in their first year at UA: ""Success Strategies in STEM"" and ""Research Readiness."" These workshops and their coursework are preparing students for paid internships with local businesses in the mining industry, hydrologic and environmental consulting, federal, state and local agencies and with environmental NGOs. Participating GeoPathways hosts are matched with student interns after their first year at UA. The 320-hour internships are being implemented either as 8 weeks fulltime during the summer or for part-time over a longer period, depending on the needs of the host and the intern. Between 8 and 10 interns are being selected each year of the project.  Members of the first-year's cohort serve as peer mentors during later years of the program, and make presentations at PCC or other 2YCs on their internship experiences. The new UA strategic plan, ""Never Settle"", calls for the engagement of every undergraduate student with professional or community service during their degree program. This UA-wide effort will help sustain the program beyond its initial NSF support.<br/><br/>Project effectiveness of the integrated approach involving mentoring, workshops and internships in support of 2-year to 4-year college transitions is being evaluated in order to document its potential as a model for similar partnerships among 2YCs, research universities, and potential employers in the local community.  It is hypothesized that the UA GeoPathways experience will enhance the recruitment, retention, academic performance and graduation rates of students transferring from PCC and other Arizona 2YCs. The project will better serve prospective geoscientists from groups that are under-represented in four-year academic programs and the workforce: economically disadvantaged students, under-represented minorities, older students and military veterans. Providing hands-on experience for transfer students will assist them in selecting coursework for specialization and may prepare them for entering graduate school. UA GeoPathways will strengthen ties between UA Geosciences and local employers, creating more opportunities for all students."

This program represents a collaboration between the University of California, Riverside (UCR), Riverside Community College (RCC), and the Riverside Unified School District (RUSD), with engagement opportunities for additional community colleges and public school districts in the region. The American Geosciences Institute predicts that the geoscience workforce faces a potential shortfall of ~135,000 by the year 2020 unless recruitment rates are improved. The GEODE Program addresses this potential shortfall by focusing recruitment on communities that are historically underrepresented in the geosciences and thus represent an untapped pool of intellectual capital. Riverside County, located east of Los Angeles County in Southern California, is densely populated (2.3 million), highly diverse (47.4% Hispanic), and home to a wide range of geoscience career opportunities, and is therefore an ideal region in which to recruit new geoscientists.<br/><br/>The GEODE Program has two goals: (1) To create a range of programs designed to increase the number of underrepresented minority students in the geosciences and successfully usher them into the geoscience workforce, and (2) To test the efficacy of these programs in order to determine which programs should be used to increase recruitment and retention of new geoscientists from underrepresented minorities in other regions and by other institutions. The GEODE Program is increasing the recruitment and retention of a highly diverse and academically prepared workforce by increasing awareness of career opportunities in the geosciences and improving students' transitions through three critical educational junctures: (1) High School to College (2-Year and 4-Year), (2) Community College to University, and (3) University to Workforce. At each critical juncture, the GEODE Program is creating opportunities for students to be exposed to the wonders of the natural world through a multitude of field and research experiences.  The program also provides students with mentors, academic support and professional development programs to ensure retention and success. By leveraging the success of existing support programs at UCR for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students from underrepresented backgrounds, the GEODE Program is creating a geoscience network throughout its collaborating institutions."

However, the geoscience workforce in the US is facing not only a serious shortage for the coming decade, but the field struggles to keep pace with the changing national demographics. Of all of the STEM fields, geoscience has the least ethnic diversity, with Hispanics accounting for only ~3%, suggesting a clear consequence of the historically low enrollment of Hispanic students in geoscience fields. The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), with its rapidly growing Environmental and Earth Sciences (EES) program, is the nation's second-largest Hispanic-serving institution with ~29,000 students (~90% Hispanic). UTRGV's strategic location along the international border with Mexico, as well as its founding principles, make it an ideal hub to nurture geoscientists from South Texas and beyond.<br/><br/>The goals of ""GP-EXTRA: Stimulating Hispanic Participation in the Geosciences (SHIP-GEO)"" at UTRGV are to contribute to reducing the US geoscience workforce shortage predicted for the coming decade and to increase Hispanic participation. SHIP-GEO aims to double, within five years (two years beyond NSF support), the annual number of graduates from the Environmental and Earth Sciences program. These goals are being achieved by hosting activities geared toward student recruitment and retention while building a mentoring network of students and alumni. The alumni mentors are helping to direct the students in their career and future success. The project has four objectives: (1) grow the existing EES program at UTRGV with the specific aim to recruit and retain students in geoscience; (2) increase community awareness of Earth systems; (3) guide community college and high school students into geoscience careers; and (4) expose undergraduate students to research as a path to graduate school. These objectives are being achieved through: pairing undergraduate majors with alumni who are working in the field of interest of the student; encouraging the transfer of community college students into the EES program at UTRGV through field trips, guest speakers, and an annual alumni career day; and expanding undergraduate research opportunities by engaging students in ongoing projects. The project also is awarding fifty scholarships to five cohorts of students over three years. SHIP-GEO contributes to the NSF's goal of increasing diversity in the geoscience pipeline by attracting, supporting and preparing Hispanic students for careers in geosciences in South Texas, and is expected to become one of the best-known programs in the nation for producing quality Hispanic geoscientists."

Though national standards introduce the field as early as the 6th grade, many teachers lack the proficiency to develop content or to confidently deliver instruction and career guidance in the Earth Sciences.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) are untapped resources and opportunities to meet these needs. The Expanding HBCU Pathways to Geoscience Education project proposes to develop and deploy a deep-dive assessment to (1) impact middle school teacher preparation curricula and professional development activities toward the goal of (2) improving African American representation in the geosciences. The systematic approach will result in an Evaluation and Enhancement Tool that will allow the user to assess their institutional approach with evidence-based best practices of HBCUs and other entities in geoscience methods, practices, and outcomes; administrative leadership; and institutional support with particular emphasis on pre-service teacher preparation curricula and programs.   Evaluation and Enhancement are two components of the proposed work, which may be used by institutions to prescriptively address any gaps that are identified. As the 2 stages of the Tool (Evaluation & Enhancement) are developed and then mapped to each other, this team anticipates that voids will be identified for which there are inadequate or missing Enhancement Tools to meet the need.  For example, previous collective experience of the HBCU Pathways group indicates that culturally relevant materials will need to be developed and tested as they are critical in reaching and attracting students from underrepresented groups.  These materials would help these student groups see the role that they can fill with a career and/or significant training in the Geosciences.  Each of these steps is essential in systematically determining the path forward for increasing diversity in the Geosciences so that we may more holistically address the environmental issues that exist and that will continue to be revealed in coming years.<br/><br/>The Expanding HBCU Pathways to Geoscience Education project will develop and test an Evaluation and Enhancement Tool that can be used by HBCUs and other institutions that reach or aspire to attract and support African Americans in the Geosciences, including Geoscience Education.  Because geoscience diversity and inclusion efforts over the past half century have resulted in a less than notable increase, the HBCU Pathways Team will use a range of critical components to supporting the success of African Americans in the Geosciences for the development of the Evaluation component of the Instrument. These include strength of institutional/ programmatic support and capacity for geoscience curricula and activities, while targeting pre-service and in-service teachers. Thus, HBCU Pathways will deliver a strategic multidimensional solution (1) to impact middle school teacher preparation curricula and professional development activities toward the goal of (2) improving minority access to the geosciences. This multidimensional and scalable solution will be developed and tested at 3 institutions in the first 12 months and 2 additional institutions in the second 12 months.  At each stage, Enhancement Resources will be vetted and mapped to recommend site-specific prescriptive resources to fortify efforts by institutions to offer hands-on training, develop geoscience content, and deliver geosciences into HBCU pre-service teacher preparation curricula and programs. <br/>Core interdisciplinary teams and additional partners and advisors, will utilize a theory-driven process of intervention design and evaluation to develop an effective, sustainable, and scalable institutional and programmatic-level intervention. The approach will be used to support the development of interventions by bringing together key stakeholders, particularly Teacher Educators, Regional School-System Representatives, and Geoscientists from the start to scrutinize and address proposed approaches to achieving plausible, feasible, and testable assessment methods and enhancement activities. This will also be aligned with the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation standards. Additionally, this focused effort to systematically develop and complete testing of a scalable, interactive, stakeholder-driven deep dive process will assist the HBCU and broader Education community in advancing geoscience education and workforce development by accessing the untapped HBCU community resources and opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

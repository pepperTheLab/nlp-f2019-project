New astronomical surveys will result in datasets much larger than those previously available.  This poses new challenges for data-driven discovery.  It also enables new opportunities for interdisciplinary research.  Astronomy is at the forefront in creating ""pi-shaped"" data scientists.  These people have both science expertise and cross-disciplinary knowledge.  Many other fields also see the need for such pi-shaped scientists.  The La Serena School for Data Science 2017-2021 will introduce undergraduates and graduates to the tools and techniques they need.  They will be ready just in time for the large scientific projects of 2020 and beyond.<br/><br/>The existence of enormous (peta-scale) datasets coming from wide-area and time-domain astronomical surveys poses significant concerns for data-driven discovery, access, and analysis, even while enabling new opportunities for interdisciplinary research in applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and related topics.  Astronomy provides a sandbox where scientists can come together from diverse fields to address common challenges within the ""Big Data"" paradigm.  The one-week La Serena School, each year from 2017 to 2021, will train the next generation of scientists in astronomy, biomedicine, computer science, statistics, and mathematics, from the US, Chile and other countries, in the tools and techniques of massive data.  With the experience gained from this school, participants will be prepared to lead the exploration of the extremely large datasets of tomorrow.  The pilot schools, held from 2013 to 2015, were very successful, both demonstrating the demand, and building a strong foundation for collaboration between the NSF and Chilean institutions.  This award will bring 15-18 U.S. students, roughly half of the class each year, to Chile for a combination of learning about massive data and working side-by-side with their Latin-American and other international colleagues.  Support for the schools is shared with a diverse set of Chilean institutions.  NSF funding is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

Using observations from ground- and space-based telescopes, Curtis will study the relationship between magnetic activity and rotation of stars and how this relationship changes with age. Because stars change very little over most of their lifetimes, determining their ages is challenging, but it is essential for understanding planets around other stars. Curtis will also  conduct an annual data science workshop in basic computing, statistical, and data analysis methods for the participants of a program that prepares underrepresented minority students for graduate school; and he will serve as research mentor to one student from this program.<br/><br/>The proposed research will address stellar ages with a two-pronged observational program: (1) Curtis will analyze rotation data for 3 GYr stars down to 0.39 Solar masses from his ongoing survey of Ruprecht 147 with the Kepler space telescope, to calibrate gyrochronology relations at low mass at older ages. The Kepler survey also will yield asteroseismic measurements for dwarfs in this benchmark star cluster. Comparison of the red giant asteroseismic masses and FGK dwarf rotation sequences between the similarly aged NGC 6819 and R147 will demonstrate the precision and relative accuracy of each method; and (2) Curtis has initiated a large chromospheric activity survey of middle-aged star clusters with the Multi Mirror Telescope (MMT) to establish an activity-age relationship that is applicable to K dwarfs. As part of his education plan, Curtis will be integrated into Columbia University's Bridge to the Ph.D Program to (1) conduct an annual data science workshop series that will instruct Bridge Participants in basic computing, statistical methods, and data analysis with Python (materials from the workshop will be incorporated in a Data Science Primer for Astronomers); and (2) supervise one Bridge Participant's research, which will focus on measuring 3 GYr M dwarf rotation."

To extract knowledge from these large and complex data sets we must account for noise and gaps, and understand if and when we may have detected a fundamentally new physical phenomenon.  The problem is not solely the size of the data, but a basic question of how to discover, represent, visualize and interact with the knowledge that these data contain.  Astronomical data provide a popular testbed for developing methods applicable throughout the physical and life sciences.<br/><br/>astroML is an open source machine-learning library that addresses all of the challenges, providing a publicly available repository for fast python implementations of statistical routines for astronomy, as well as examples of astrophysical data analyses using techniques from statistics and machine learning.  In the three years since its release, astroML has been installed over 21,000 times.  The current project will further develop astroML into a general machine learning toolkit for the next generation of astrophysical surveys, adding code examples and tutorials, exploiting multicore and multiprocessing hardware, and supporting the second edition of the text ""Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Python Guide for the Analysis of Survey Data"".  Algorithms to be developed include approximate Bayesian computation, hierarchical Bayes, an interface to deep learning algorithms, and modifying the regression and regularization code to account for uncertainties within the data.<br/><br/>All developed algorithms will be publicly available, and astroML has already been used in cancer research and analysis of the securities market, and to teach data science in astronomy.  The refactored code can be used to teach both the statistics and software engineering techniques needed for large scale machine learning."

However, most variable astronomical sources are aperiodic, showing erratic and irregular changes.  They remain poorly studied in comparison to periodic sources, even though they can play a key role in our understanding of complex dynamic physical environments, from stars, to gas and dust flows, to galaxies.  This work studies aperiodic variability using the data from two NSF-supported projects, the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS), and the newly begun Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).  This is the first large-scale systematic study of these phenomena, and it will be the definitive study, well into the next decade.  It is an excellent case study for data-intensive science, applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to real data.  It will expose students to cutting-edge data science, and its products will contribute to projects that will train the next generation in how to handle big astronomical data.<br/><br/>Even though the majority of variable sources are aperiodic, they are poorly understood, and for well-known examples like quasars and young stellar objects many fundamental questions remain about the physical mechanisms behind their optical variability.  New sky surveys are enabling systematic studies of variability and discovering many new phenomena, including sub-parsec separated quasar binaries, multi-year long flares attributable to microlensing of explosive activity in the accretion disk, and changing-state sources indicative of variable accretion rates.  These extreme behaviors should be easily discoverable with modern robust statistical methods.  This work will create generative data-derived models with novel non-parametric discriminating features from CRTS data, and use the models to predict the future behavior of aperiodic sources, which can then be monitored in real-time using ZTF and other synoptic facilities.  Prior work focused on robust statistical characterization and identifying extreme variable classes.  This will be extended to more general aperiodic sources and more sophisticated non-parametric generative models.  The unprecedented sky coverage of ZTF joins with the unequalled archival coverage of CRTS to make this the definitive study.  In keeping with the CRTS Open Data and ZTF alert policies, all transitioning objects identified will be released to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It consists of two pieces: a deep, multi-band map covering 5000 square degrees, and a ""cosmic movie"" of a thirty square-degree region obtained by revisiting that area at least once every six nights.  The wide-area survey will measure positions, shapes, fluxes, and approximate (photometric) redshifts for around 300 million galaxies, and the time-domain survey will discover and measure light curves for several thousand supernovae and other transients.  Data collection began in August 2013 and is planned to run for five annual, six-month observing seasons.  Wide community and public access to the DES data are a vital component of the DES Data Management system, and will make the survey valuable in the long run to groups far beyond those actually carrying out the survey.  DES uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a new wide-field, facility instrument built by the DES collaboration and installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.<br/><br/>This award supports continued operation of the DES Data Management (DM) system at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) from January 2016 to August 2021, that is, through the end of DES survey science operations.  A fully calibrated and completely re-reduced public dataset covering the entire survey will be issued around the end of FY 2020.  DESDM processes raw images into science-ready data products.  This involves: (1) nightly processing of DES images, (2) annual processing of all images at the end of each observing season and release of a database to the Collaboration; (3) improvements in reduction algorithms, in close concert with the science working groups; (4) production of calibrated, single-epoch images released via the Science Archive at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory; (5) production and dissemination of two major public releases of data products, one based on the first two DES observing seasons (DR1), and the second based on the full DES survey (DR2).<br/><br/>In addition to their use for the primary science goals, the public release of DES images and catalogs stimulates a wide variety of research by the astronomy community, as well as significant engagement in citizen science by the general public.  These archival research projects will go well beyond the scientific goals of the DES.

Future surveys will also produce spectra, breaking down light into its wavelengths to reveal the physical state of the galaxies.  The present, ambitious, project will extend the involvement of volunteers into these spectroscopic data, providing a richer experience for participants and addressing research in galaxy formation impossible to accomplish any other way.  If the scalability problem of handling massive amounts of spectral data can also be solved this way, the impact for the community and for the scientifically literate public will be enormous.<br/><br/>While crowdsourced galaxy classifications have proven their worth with a decade of images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), several next generation surveys will be spectroscopic, which substantially increases the complexity of the data sets, while providing a much larger space for discovery.  Although having spectra for tens of millions of objects will allow a wide range of science, new tools are needed to maximize the scientific return.  Automatic algorithms alone will either struggle in identifying difficult features or produce highly contaminated samples to try to maximize completeness.  The volume of data from forthcoming surveys renders human scrutiny impractical.  This project will meet these challenges, extending to spectroscopic data the successful crowdsourcing approach used for imaging by the suite of Galaxy Zoo projects, and expanding previous NSF-supported work by this team.  There will be two components: (1) Galaxy Nurseries will build an emission line catalog through crowdsourced classifications of spectroscopic data; and (2) Clump Scout will identify clumpy galaxies in the SDSS.  Investigations with these catalogs will constrain galaxy formation models by (1) quantifying the fraction of galaxies with giant star-forming regions; (2) characterizing the internal variation of physical properties of such regions; and (3) comparing the gas metallicity of galaxies with and without these regions.<br/><br/>As with the previous image work, the high-level catalogs to be produced, and the new classification algorithms to be used, are to be released publicly, and will be a valuable resource for the community.  The study also continues the work to implement Galaxy Zoo in undergraduate astronomy courses, involving both graduate and undergraduate students."

The investigators will create realistic 3-Dimensional (3D) modeling tools to study the basic science problem of measuring the coronal magnetic field structure in solar active regions (AR) and reconstructing AR heating structure. This new modeling will augment the investigators' existing capabilities for AR modeling, and use all of the advanced modeling tools and computer codes they have already developed. The project will make new scientific products such as maps of the coronal magnetic field, and 3D models of individual ARs built using input from observations. This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of magnetic field structure and activity at the Sun.  The research group has established a summer internship research program for high school students in the Union County Vocational Magnet School having concentration on Science, where the tools developed under this project will be heavily used.<br/><br/><br/>This project leverages an extensive, quantitative use of radio data available from a variety of modern radio interferometry arrays and combines these diagnostics with more traditional EUV and optical data as well as coronal modeling approaches based on these data (in particular, nonlinear force-free field modeling). The investigators will employ new science capabilities of the radio imaging spectroscopy data from solar active regions, augmented by advanced theory and 3D modeling of gyroresonance (GR) and free-free emission. The GR process gives radio emission its ability to provide direct measurements in the corona of magnetic field strength and direction, and so provides the key to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying all of solar activity.  Interpretation of the observations relies on construction of comprehensive models for the atmosphere, including both plasma and magnetic field models, which are then matched to the data through forward fitting. These theory and modeling efforts are needed in order to exploit the powerful new radio data coming online now from a number of radio instruments including the VLA, Expanded OVSA (EOVSA), and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two astronomy data visualization systems -- Science On A Sphere (SOS) and GeoDome Digital Planetarium -- along with interactive exhibits and an astronomy classroom will be installed.  Both GeoDome and SOS are equipped to take astronomical imagery and modify it for spherical or hemispherical projection.   The images and animations developed at KPNO can be shared with other facilities employing both SOS and the GeoDome (currently over 225 such facilities worldwide). The goals of this project are to develop the International Astronomy Outreach Center (IAOC), run by KPVC, as a functioning, self-sustaining astronomy outreach center, and expand the focus of the programs to include all NSF-supported astronomy. The benefits of such a program include:  1) significantly improved capability of the KPVC to present more engaging astronomy-based experiences to onsite guests, and 2) extended reach beyond those who travel to Kitt Peak.<br/><br/>This project provides a new, cost-effective model for conversion of an outdated science facility to a self-supporting educational facility that communicates the process and results of modern astronomical research. The long history of major investment in the facility will continue to generate returns as the facility is preserved and transformed into a new 21st-century astronomy outreach center using research-based best practices in science visualization and communication. Using the Science On A Sphere (SOS) and GeoDome Digital Planetarium platforms, Kitt Peak gains a highly capable facility to serve its visitors in new ways, while all NSF-funded astronomy facilities gain new global exposure through astronomy visualizations to public audiences without major investments.

This enables a major expansion and enhancement of existing programs and the creation of new programs. Guests to KPNO will have a wider window on modern astronomy, and regional and Tribal schools will benefit from new STEM education experiences. Visitors to museums and parks elsewhere in the US and other countries will see astronomy results created in this new, far-reaching facility displayed in their SOS theaters and GeoDome planetaria.

FLOYDS will reduce this lag by an order of magnitude and make some currently exotic probes of supernova progenitors routine.  The core effort is to (1) determine an immediate spectroscopic type and redshift of every new supernova discovered with a nondetection within the past week, and (2) obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of supernovae every few days for a subset of  the most interesting 150 (100 SNe Ia / 50 core-collapse) targets.

Until recently, resources were sufficiently limited that only selected populations could be extensively monitored in the time domain, but modern telescopes and detectors can survey cosmic volumes much more quickly than before.  As a consequence, synoptic time-domain astronomy - the study of cosmic variability across sizeable populations - is becoming a dominant mode of study.  Such surveys provide not simply more data, but a different kind of data, requiring a new approach to statistical learning capable of extracting information from large ensembles of multivariate, irregularly and asynchronously sampled light curves.  Astronomy is not the only discipline facing this change in the nature of data.  Functional data analysis (FDA) is a rapidly growing area of statistics that addresses inference from datasets that sample ensembles of related functions.  The present interdisciplinary project will use FDA concepts and techniques to develop new methods to address several problem areas of survey data analysis, from astrophysical modeling of variability using catalog data, to the detection of variable and transient sources in images.  One main application will be the analysis of light curves of periodic variable stars using functional mixed effects models.  In particular, Cepheid variable stars are a foundation of the cosmic distance scale, and the hope is that these new functional models can provide more accurate brightness estimates and therefore ease limits on how accurately important cosmological parameters can be measured.  Other problems well suited to FDA methods include the detection of dim intermittent signals, and the classification of sources from features in their light curves.<br/><br/>The team includes experts in astronomy and in statistics, and will pursue innovative research in both disciplines.  This research will enhance their partnership by direct collaboration, by dissemination of results in both communities, and by training a graduate student in information sciences to work on problems in astronomy.  The methods produced will improve the science return on the large investments being made in astronomical surveys.  The investigators are also involved with the Penn State University's interdisciplinary Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers, helping to train young astronomers in advanced statistics and machine learning methods."

Mimir was built over a decade ago with support from NSF, NASA, and the W.M. Keck Foundation. Mimir measures the polarization of infrared light produced by the dust in the Milky Way. Most of the dust (and gas) is found in large clouds that drift through space. These clouds collapse under their own weight to form new stars. Careful analysis of the polarized light from these dusty clouds teaches us about the magnetic fields that control the shapes and sizes of each cloud. The magnetic fields also affect the way the clouds collapse to make stars. Much of the data has already been collected. The awardees now need funding to support the careful examination of the data. The data will be used, together with observations from other telescopes such as the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and NSF's Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), to test models of Milky Way clouds and star formation. Students from Boston University will be trained on how to take the Mimir data and examine the polarimetry results. A graduate student will use Mimir, SOFIA and ALMA data to complete their PhD project. Undergraduate students (including many who are not majoring in astronomy) will be brought to Arizona to operate Mimir on the Perkins telescope. These telescope trips often inspire students to follow careers in science. Other students will participate in the observing by videoconference. The team will also pursue outreach opportunities at the Boston Museum of Science, where the Department of Astronomy at Boston University holds weekly open nights.  <br/><br/>Mimir is being used by the awardees to survey the magnetic field structure along the galactic plane and in various star forming regions via background starlight polarization measurements in the near-infrared H-band. Their survey, dubbed the Galactic Plane Infrared Polarization Survey (GPIPS), covers 76 square degrees of the inner disk and probes up to 20 magnitudes of extinction. Complementary mid-IR polarization measurements are used to probe star forming clouds up to 50 magnitudes of extinction.  Various well-known techniques (Zeeman splitting, the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, etc.) will be used on these and complementary archival data to infer field strengths and orientations across the surveyed areas.  Analysis of these data will provide quantitative tests of models of galactic B-fields and constrain theories of star formation in dense molecular clouds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Especially when large quantities of information must be distilled into theoretical insights, and the individual items are themselves actually of less certainty, a probability-based approach offers impressive advantages.  This project will generate toolkits to implement such novel approaches to the extraction of knowledge from overwhelmingly large data sets.  With the potential to transform the way science is done both in cosmology and in other areas under threat of being swamped with data, the impact of this work cannot be overestimated.  The methods will both use and propagate collaborations with applied mathematics that make the impossible possible.<br/><br/>New cosmological surveys will require measurement of smaller signals using larger numbers of galaxies which are individually observed at lower confidence.  This will require data analyses that are as information-preserving as possible.  This project will create new methods for cosmological data analysis that permit inferences using not lossy, derived data products, such as galaxy catalogs, best-fit redshifts, or correlation function point estimates, but something much closer to the original imaging and spectroscopic data.  These techniques will be informed by the principles of probabilistic inference and applied-mathematics technology.  The work creates three related toolsets.  Toolset 1 is for reconstruction and marginalization of cosmological density fields, which could be the mass, galaxy, or neutral-gas density field, or the two-dimensional projected mass density.  Toolset 2 is for cosmological inference that makes proper use of probabilistic information about galaxy and quasar redshifts, improving probabilistic redshift information, and providing informative imputation of missing redshifts, thereby producing predictions and tools for smaller-scale scientific questions.  Toolset 3 is for propagation of probabilistic image-level quantities such as galaxy shapes and the point-spread function, into weak-lensing studies of large-scale structure.  This will permit inference from survey data conditional priors over galaxy shapes, and use them in a justified forward-modeling measurement of the shear field and cosmological parameters.  The toolsets from this project will be the first practical methods for cosmological inference and large-scale structure measurement that can make full and proper, justified, use of probabilistic outputs.  For the first time, it will be possible to perform simultaneous inference or refinement of catalog-level properties along with large-scale structure and cosmological inferences.  Simultaneous inference will significantly reduce statistical biases in cosmological measurements, and also reduce variance in catalog-level quantities.<br/><br/>The toolsets will be papers and methods but also open-source codebases, with benefits beyond cosmology.  These developments will help create standards for generating and delivering probabilistic outputs.  The research will reach populations inside and outside academia by producing pedagogical papers on inference, data analysis, and computational statistics in the physical sciences."

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  The investigators in this project will use a pioneering new data set acquired through the Sloan Digital Sky Survey multi-object reverberation mapping project (SDSS-RM) to transform our knowledge of black hole demographics and the physics of AGNs across the observable Universe.  This project will yield the first set of reliable reverberation-mapping (RM) black hole masses (MBH) that includes targets at very large distances from Earth (with redshifts z > 0.3); these RM results will allow us to investigate whether SMBH growth leads or lags galaxy star formation and to more accurately characterize the physics regulating the growth and feedback of AGNs.<br/><br/>In addition, the investigators will use SDSS-RM data to design and execute a summer research program for high school students participating in Penn State's Summer Research Experience in the Eberly College of Science.  This program is operated in collaboration with Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science center and targets students from underserved school districts in Pennsylvania.  The investigators will provide low-income students with the opportunity to interact with scientists and to learn basic astronomy data analysis.  This program will provide mentoring experience for postdocs, who will supervise the Penn State student leading the workshop.  This Penn State student will in turn gain experience by mentoring the high school students participating in the program.  Both faculty collaborators will mentor the participating postdocs; this will give them the opportunity to teach, strategically plan for future career goals, and become leaders in large-scale time-domain spectroscopic research.<br/><br/>The investigators will use the SDSS-RM data to accomplish the following: (1) Measure black hole masses for 100 quasars, tripling the existing sample size and expanding it to cover the broad range in quasar parameter space missed by previous RM surveys (in redshift, luminosity, and emission-line properties), (2) Employ these black hole masses to improve substantially our understanding of black-hole/galaxy scaling relations used to characterize supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass demographics, and (3) Characterize the structure and physics of the broad line-emitting region using the responses of various emission lines and velocity-resolved reverberation methods.  Unlike previous work, which was limited by highly uncertain MBH values that resulted in largely unconstrained estimates of any possible evolution of SMBH-galaxy relationships, the SDSS-RM data set will distinguish between causal or coincidental coevolution by enabling the first study of evolution in the intrinsic scatter of the MBH-host galaxy correlations.  The response of the broad line region across various emission lines will provide crucial insights regarding the physics governing and regulating AGN and SMBH/galaxy evolution."

Bombardment by large objects may have had fundamental effects on our Earth, including possibly bringing the molecules that are necessary for life.  On Earth, it is rare to see the evidence of these impacts because of the constant changes to its surface due to geological (e.g. earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) and meteorological (e.g. wind and rain) processes.  However, the Moon, due to its nearness to Earth, serves as a good substitute for understanding terrestrial impact events.  But the timing of impacts on the Moon over the last 4500 million years is not well understood.  This study will examine samples of lunar material affected by the bombardment that were brought back by the Apollo missions to try and determine how when they were formed and what they are made of.  This will help us determine what kinds of objects hit the earth, and when, potentially providing insights into their influence on Earth's evolution.<br/><br/>The PI resides at a predominantly undergraduate college, and will involve her students in studying the samples and their data so that they will learn how to manage and think critically about large data sets.  She will also bring students to the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference to present their results.  Thus, they will develop skills that will benefit them in graduate school or the workforce, and their involvement in inquiry-based learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields achieves a key aspect of the National Science Foundation's mission.  Furthermore, students who work with the lunar samples and their data will become knowledgeable about extraterrestrial sample characterization and may be poised to be some of the best-prepared graduate students available to work on any samples returned from both the Moon and Mars in the next ~20 years. <br/><br/>The Moon provides the most clear and complete history of impact events in the inner Solar System. Bombarded since its formation ~4.5 billion years ago, the Moon's impact record can be used to gain insights into how the Earth has been influenced by similar impacting events over billions of years.  The timing of impacts on the Moon, however, is not well understood and has been the focus of many studies.  Deciphering the lunar impact history is a complex process and lunar impact glasses, numerous in the regolith samples returned with the Apollo missions, can be used to address this issue.  This study focuses on obtaining geochemical and geochronological data on lunar impact glasses, which are pieces of melted regolith (lunar dirt) created by energetic impacting events on the Moon.  These impact glasses possess the composition of the target material and can be dated by the 40Ar/39Ar (argon) method in order to determine their age of formation, how long they have been exposed at the lunar surface, and the composition of the solar wind prior to the time of burial.  The study's objective is to understand the ages of impact glasses, along with their compositions, in order to learn more about Solar System processes.  In particular, team can begin to piece together information about the rate of impact events and their effects (if any) on Earth, as well as the changing nature (if any) of the solar wind composition."

This is a project to tailor Deep Learning algorithms, which have been used successfully in other fields where pattern recognition matters, to measure galaxy morphologies quickly and accurately.  The long-term goal is to develop algorithms which transform Big Data into Big Discovery in astrophysics.  All algorithms and classifications will be made available for more general use.  The principal researcher is committed to supporting scientists from under-represented groups, through hiring practices, teaching in the US and in other countries, and by helping to build the capacity for developing countries to produce cutting-edge science.<br/><br/>Morphology is a key observable for constraining galaxy formation models, but quantifying morphology is currently a time-consuming process, severely compromised by the big-data transition.  Deep Learning algorithms may be the answer.  In the first phase, algorithms will learn from the large set of morphological classifications available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  The next phase studies how to transfer the knowledge gained from SDSS into analysis of images from the Dark Energy Survey (DES).  The use of simulated images to accelerate the learning process will also be studied.  This is the first step towards the automated classification of other aspects of galaxy structure.  The long-term goal is to develop algorithms which transform Big Data into Big Discovery in astrophysics.  Work with Deep Learning derived morphologies will illustrate the data-to-discovery process.

Most stars occur in systems containing two or more objects.  Some pairs include a very dense star called a ?white dwarf? ? a star with the mass of our Sun crammed into a volume about the size of the Earth ? plus an ordinary star smaller and redder than the Sun.  In some cases, the red star can transfer a stream of mass onto a disk of gas around the white dwarf.  Matter spirals in through the disk to accumulate on the white dwarf, heating up rapidly and shining brightly for a time.  The resulting outburst of energy gives these so-called ?cataclysmic variables? (CVs) their name.  Monitoring CVs for outbursts, or to study the wealth of periodic signals they display, requires far more telescope time than professional astronomers can afford.  For the past two decades, the Principal Investigator has been leading a world-wide group of amateur astronomers using small telescopes ? which he calls the ?Center for Backyard Astrophysics? ? to obtain the necessary observations of CVs.  The data have proven extremely useful to professional astronomers who study these systems.  This project continues that fruitful collaboration, engaging amateurs around the world in valuable ?citizen science.?<br/><br/>2. Most of the information about CVs comes from various periodic signals they exhibit.  Yet few professional observers have been willing to devote the time necessary to monitor these systems in order to measure period changes (which can reveal their evolutionary timescales) or to obtain data on additional periodic phenomena they may display.  These include orbital periods and period changes, rotational periods, and so-called ?superhumps? in certain classes of CVs.  This proposal seeks to obtain long-term time-series photometry from a world-wide network of amateur astronomers using small telescopes ? called the ?Center for Backyard Astrophysics? or CBA ? to fill this need.  In addition, the Principal Investigator expects to be able to use the data obtained to help distinguish between two diametrically opposed theories for the fate of CV systems: Are the donor stars whittled away by mass transfer to the white dwarf primary, or are they evaporated by nova explosions on the white dwarfs?  The photometric time-series data and their implications for improving our understanding of CVs constitute the Intellectual Merit of this project.  The Broader Impacts of this project stem from the Principal Investigator?s continuing ability to motivate and engage the world-wide community of amateur astronomers to gather scientifically useful photometric data on these systems.  The amateur observers willingly and continually fill the gap in observational data that has been largely abandoned by the professionals, and under the leadership of the Principal Investigator they produce a steady stream of valuable photometric data on a wide variety of CVs."

This Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) system will answer questions about the first moments of the universe, the properties of its contents, the formation of structures under the influence of gravity, and the nature of dark energy.  In terms of broader impacts, the project will focus on three areas: training graduate and undergraduate students in AdvACT and related science, informing the public, and enhancing the STEM pipeline of students from underrepresented groups through outreach projects.   Students and postdoctoral researchers will be involved in the design, assembly, and testing of the new detector arrays. Two summer schools will be hosted coincident with major data releases to train graduate students and postdocs in deriving science from the data. In collaboration with the Franklin Institute, team members will co-produce a new cosmology program and deliver shows at various planetariums. Special efforts will be made to extend research opportunities to undergraduates from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The AdvACT intensity and polarization maps of the CMB will 1) overlap the entire Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey as well as other surveys not accessible from the South Pole; 2) have excellent resolution of order one arcminute (depending on frequency); 3) span 25-280 GHz in five bands, essential for the removal of Galactic foregrounds; and 4) have the spatial dynamic range to detect large-angular-scale signatures of inflation at one end, and galaxy clusters and dusty galaxies at the other.  AdvACT will perform a large-area survey to search for gravitational waves generated during inflation (B-modes), and measure the isotropy, frequency spectrum, and scale dependence of any detected signal.  Measurements of primary CMB fluctuations will improve our knowledge of key cosmological parameters, and measurements of secondary fluctuations will map out the dark matter distribution, potentially providing the first high-signal-to-noise measurement of the sum of the neutrino masses.  In addition, AdvACT maps will contain measurements of approximately 20,000 clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect, with heightened scientific impact due to overlap of the survey with X-ray and optical surveys such as eROSITA, the Dark Energy Survey, and LSST. AdvACT millimeter-wavelength source lists will provide many thousands of targets for study by ALMA.  The program will deliver a number of astronomy community benefits, including public maps, assistance to other teams, and free sharing of technology techniques."

The Digital Analysis of a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project is now fully ready with its hardware, software and personnel resource planning and full production scanning, processing and data distribution and archiving can begin. This final grant will bring the world's only full-century Time Domain Astrophysics (TDA) database and analysis tools on line for the full community to utilize as a key survey that complements current surveys (PTF, CRT and PS1) and provides long-term context for LSST. The high speed precision DASCH scanner (two 8 x 10in imaging plates digitized into 11&#956;m pixels in 90 sec) and initial astrometry and photometry have now i) improved astrometry that allows multiple exposure plate solutions as well as initial astrometry essentially independent of what the plate jacket might have indicated, ii) improved photometry.  We build the Pipeline and Database software and hardware to enable the original goal to scan and fully process ~400 plates/day, which would enable the full collection of ~450,000 direct imaging plates to be scanned and fully reduced, with rapid access to images (thumbnails), lightcurves , and data products on spinning disk.  The present effort will finish the production scanning, overnight processing, and full data releases (DRs, in 10 installments) of the ~375,000 plates remaining. Although a single field (6o centered on M44, our first ""development field"") is now in the public domain, the limited coverage presents the novel TDA surveys that DASCH can do for discovery and study of rare classes of variables which require larger survey coverage. <br/><br/>DASCH incorporates students at every stage and a vigorous program of Public Outreach. This research will open the astronomical window of time variability on long timescales (months-100y) from currently existing, but inaccessible and barely-mined data. Digitization is the key and can now be done with our new ultra-high speed scanner and high speed processing and database. Accessing the past data complements present (e.g. PanSTARRS) and future temporal surveys (LSST). Opening this new temporal window has already revealed new phenomena; it will surely excite new students and the public at large.<br/>This project will awaken the public awareness that the universe is not static. Evolution and change are the rule, not the exception. The impact on science education can be large: by showing on the project website segments of the ""cosmic movie"" of giant flares from quasars or stars, or the heart beat pulsations of Cepheid variables, students will better understand the excitement of current astronomy. Physical understanding of the dynamic universe is even more enticing than the immutable sky. The public website to be fully developed by this investigation will be fully accessible to the public and astronomical community. DASCH will have significant impact on the general drive to Temporal Surveys for a number of projects now in development. It makes available the truly unique dataset that only a century of sky coverage can provide."

With the successful construction of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the recent enhancement of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), two new forefront facilities are moving into routine operation with ever-increasing scientific capability. Taken together, these iconic arrays fulfill a major milestone in modern astronomy, encompassing more than an order-of-magnitude leap in observational capabilities for astronomical sources at frequencies between 1 gigahertz and 1 terahertz. <br/><br/>As prioritized by multiple National Research Council Decadal Surveys in Astronomy and Astrophysics, NRAO facilities are tools for the entire scientific community that will empower discoveries across all fields of astrophysics. ALMA enables transformational research into the physics of the cold Universe, regions that are optically dark but shine brightly in the millimeter/submillimeter portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Within the broad range of science accessible with ALMA, the top-level objectives include imaging the redshifted dust continuum and molecular line emission from evolving galaxies as early as a redshift of z~10 (500 million years after the Big Bang), determining the chemical composition and dynamics of star-forming gas in normal galaxies like the Milky Way but at z~3 (75% of the way across the Universe), and measuring the gas kinematics in young disks in nearby star-forming clouds. ALMA has already demonstrated its revolutionary impact with its dramatic images of planet, star and galaxy formation. These results will accelerate as the full array becomes operational, and with the longest baselines ALMA will achieve an angular resolution of tens of milli-arseconds. ALMA provides one to two orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous facilities in all areas of millimeter- and submillimeter-wave observations, including sensitivity, angular resolution and image fidelity. <br/><br/>Likewise, at centimeter wavelengths, the broadband VLA has ushered in a new era in radio astronomy, with groundbreaking results published in areas ranging from Galactic proto-stellar clouds to images of the molecular gas in the earliest galaxies. The enhanced VLA is opening new scientific frontiers and explicitly addressing four primary science themes: measuring the strength and topology of cosmic magnetic fields; imaging young stars and massive black holes in dust-enshrouded environments; following the rapid evolution of energetic phenomena; and studying the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies and active galactic nuclei. Improvement over previous performance is up to a factor of 10 in continuum sensitivity and coarsest frequency resolution, and a factor of 1000 or more in finest frequency resolution and the number of frequency channels. <br/><br/>In collaboration with NSF's international partners in ALMA, NRAO will transition ALMA from the current phase of commissioning and early science to full science operations. Already the most capable millimeter/submillimeter facility on the planet, in the next few years ALMA will realize significant new capabilities, further increasing ALMA's scientific productivity. The ALMA Development <br/>Program, a key component in the plan for the coming decade, will solicit and support community input and expertise in upgrading ALMA's capabilities throughout its useful lifetime. <br/><br/>Under AUI management, NRAO will implement a staged VLA infrastructure maintenance and development plan to renew and support operation of the VLA beyond the end of the next decade, followed by community-based planning and technical development for the next-generation centimeter-wave facilities. AUI will expand the NRAO Central Development Laboratory (CDL) mission to enhance NSF's existing radio astronomy facilities, to develop technology and expertise needed to build the next generation of radio astronomy instruments, and to benefit the broader economy via technology transfer. In collaboration with the university community, the CDL will support development for both ALMA and VLA and conduct leading-edge, creative research in both core and exploratory technologies that will continue to be vital to the NRAO mission in the coming decade. <br/><br/>With plans for enhanced user support services and new data manipulation and visualization tools, AUI envisions expanding the NRAO user base beyond traditional radio astronomers and enabling multi-wavelength science by researchers and students. AUI will also ensure that NSF's investment in NRAO achieves the broadest possible impact in cutting-edge research and technical innovation, training the next generation of researchers, and inspiring students and the public. <br/><br/>Building on an existing framework of diversity activities, AUI will conduct ambitious programs to transform the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. An Office of Diversity Initiatives will lead programs, including the National Astronomy Consortium and Physics Inspiring the Next Generation, to empower under-represented students to obtain graduate degrees in STEM fields. The enhanced International/National Exchange Program and Chilean Women Graduate Internships will support international student research in radio astronomy. A key AUI objective for the NRAO workforce in the coming decade will be to move toward achieving parity with the nation's demographics for women and people of color. <br/><br/>AUI embraces an integrative approach to education and public outreach (EPO), closely aligned with NRAO research. The EPO plan builds on a comprehensive suite of programs, targeting learners of all ages, broad geographic regions, and traditionally under-represented groups, and incorporates federal STEM education initiatives that identify evidence-based best practices. NRAO will support graduate and undergraduate research, and Jansky postdoctoral fellows will carry out investigations independently, or in collaboration with staff and/or university collaborators, thus building professional relationships between NRAO and academic research groups. <br/><br/>As part of AUI's management and oversight of NRAO, AUI will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of NRAO as well as AUI's own governance and business practices.

The PI of this award led the team that built the GTC's ""CanariCam"", a unique camera that images heat radiation from galaxies, star-forming regions, young planetary systems, supernovae, and other phenomena at the frontiers of astrophysics. To maximize the science productivity of telescope time provided in return for CanariCam development and to forge a strong international science collaboration, the CanariCam Science Team (CCST) was formed to provide access to this enormous telescope to US astronomers, including graduate students and post-docs, who would not otherwise be permitted to use it. This NSF award supports essential activities of this international team, particularly science planning, observing, analysis, and dissemination of results. This program also introduces many US astronomers to observational techniques with which they are unlikely to have had much previous experience, and it provides graduate students and post-docs an unparalleled opportunity to receive training in an international environment while exposing them to advanced astronomical techniques and research at the world's largest telescope.<br/><br/>This NSF award provides critical on-going support to assure the success of the CanariCam Science Team (CCST). A highly diverse set of science programs proposed by individual scientists on the CCST are shaped by the PI into a coherent super-program to be carried out across several observing semesters and on any particular night. Especially for more complex programs, the PI meets face-to-face with CCST members and travels to the telescope for some observing runs to ensure that all CCST observations are carried out smoothly and efficiently by GTC staff. Data reduction for CanariCam is supported formally in publicly available IRAF routines, but this award also supports community-wide dissemination of high-quality, mostly IDL, reduction and analysis routines developed by CCST members for their own purposes. Finally, annual team meetings supported by this award play a critical role in engaging and training students and postdocs, since they are scientifically intense and hands-on experiences in which real science is being planned, discussed, and debated."

Currently, these disks are sent to a purpose-built computer cluster for processing and imaging. But the sensitivity required for the most cutting edge work in this field has led to recording rates and data volumes that now exceed the capacity of in-house computing clusters. This project will include a partnership with Google to develop infrastructure and software that will shift VLBI processing to the cloud, where enormous virtual machines can be nimbly configured to process scientific data at speeds that easily keep pace with advancing recording rates. This project will revolutionize the practice of VLBI, and provide an extensible means of increasing array bandwidths and spectral resolution for a broad range of science.  At the absolute limits of the VLBI technique, a millimeter wavelength global array will image nearby supermassive black holes as part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).

The project will develop a hardware/software approach in conjunction with commercial partner, Google.  This approach will include a new recording system for VLBI using customized commercial appliances for the transfer of data from the telescope to the cloud, and modifications to existing correlator code to make it suitable for execution on a parallelized, cloud-based platform.

In collaboration with the university community, the CDL will support development for both ALMA and VLA and conduct leading-edge, creative research in both core and exploratory technologies that will continue to be vital to the NRAO mission in the coming decade.  <br/><br/>With plans for enhanced user support services and new data manipulation and visualization tools, AUI envisions expanding the NRAO user base beyond traditional radio astronomers and enabling multi-wavelength science by researchers and students. AUI will also ensure that NSF's investment in NRAO achieves the broadest possible impact in cutting-edge research and technical innovation, training the next generation of researchers, and inspiring students and the public.<br/><br/>Building on an existing framework of diversity activities, AUI will conduct ambitious programs to transform the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering. An Office of Diversity Initiatives will lead programs, including the National Astronomy Consortium and Physics Inspiring the Next Generation, to empower under-represented students to obtain graduate degrees in STEM fields. The enhanced International/National Exchange Program and Chilean Women Graduate Internships will support international student research in radio astronomy. A key AUI objective for the NRAO workforce in the coming decade will be to move toward achieving parity with the nation's demographics for women and people of color.<br/><br/>AUI embraces an integrative approach to education and public outreach (EPO), closely aligned with NRAO research. The EPO plan builds on a comprehensive suite of programs, targeting learners of all ages, broad geographic regions, and traditionally under-represented groups, and incorporates federal STEM education initiatives that identify evidence-based best practices. NRAO will support graduate and undergraduate research, and Jansky postdoctoral fellows will carry out investigations independently, or in collaboration with staff and/or university collaborators, thus building professional relationships between NRAO and academic research groups.<br/><br/>As part of AUI's management and oversight of NRAO, AUI will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of NRAO as well as AUI's own governance and business practices. Key Performance Indicators and both qualitative and quantitative assessments will inform NRAO activities and AUI policies to achieve optimal management and operation of NRAO."

Also, their chemical composition often resembles giant gas planets like Jupiter. Studying them presents a great opportunity to learn about atmospheric physics in both stars and planets. This award funds work to study thousands of brown dwarfs using data from public archives. The researchers will update their atmospheric models, and test them with comparisons with their data. Their main database will be the SpeX Prism Spectral Library obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. They will also draw conclusions about atmospheric physics based on a detailed statistical study of these brown dwarfs. The results will also be useful to interpreting observations of extrasolar planets. A graduate student and several undergraduate students will participate in the research, including minorities. The PI will work with the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to increase the numbers of Hispanics and Native Americans in science. <br/><br/>The team will apply Bayesian atmospheric retrieval techniques, widely employed in the extrasolar planet community, to a large sample of brown dwarfs. These tools will be used to determine cloud properties and thermal structures and chemistries across a broad range of temperatures and gravities. In particular, they will address outstanding brown dwarf issues such as the behavior of clouds across the low mass L-T transition, the evolution of disequilibrium chemistry with temperature, and the first measure of the distribution of metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen ratios with the populations. First, they will upgrade their models to include high-temperature opacities and different thermal profiles. Next, they will apply their analysis across the entire SpeX database and explore the relationships between temperature, cloud properties, and molecular abundances and publish results. Ultimately, they will finish retrieval analysis on all SpeX objects and apply to other available datasets for brown dwarfs."

These observations will be extremely accurate.  In order to get the best science from these observations, two types of additional, supporting observations will also be used: observations that have been made using different telescopes and instruments in the past, and observations that will be made with other telescopes and instruments in the future.  For all of these supporting observations to be useful, they must be as accurate as the observations that will be taken using the LSST.  For this project, the astronomers will calibrate the telescopes, instruments, and sky conditions of the observatories where the other observations are or will be made.  This project serves the national interest, as it ensures that the data acquired with the new telescope will contribute the best scientific results possible, promoting the progress of observational astronomy.  The astronomers are from Texas A & M University, which draws most of its students from a heavily Hispanic population.  The investigators intend to employ two graduate students and 8 - 10 undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project will produce an enormous amount of photometric data that will revolutionize the field of astronomy.  One of the LSST goals is to provide an unprecedented level of photometric accuracy: <0.5%.  Existing and on-going data from other telescopes will be used for comparison and follow-up observations with the new LSST observations.  These observations, however, will need to be very well calibrated.  The investigators will use existing equipment to provide accurate spectrophotometric calibration of imaging systems at observatories around the world.  The calibration will include in-situ measurements of the telescopes, optics, filters, and detectors, providing detailed knowledge of the transmission profiles of the instruments.  The atmospheric transmission above the observatory sites will also be measured.  Together, these measurements will help to enable exceptionally accurate photometric calibration of these systems.  Based on similar measurements of the DECam instrument and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory location, the investigators estimate that the proposed work should allow for accuracy of ~0.2% across large surveys and all spectral bands."

The goal is to understand whether gravitational lenses can be used to understand the cosmological properties.  What makes this project possible is the growing sample of strong gravitational lenses.  These lenses are massive galaxies and clusters of galaxies that are so large they bend light coming from a more distant background object and passing near the lensing object.   Studying these lenses and the lensed objects will allow the researchers to study the mass of the galaxies and clusters, the amount of dark matter, the distant object and space between the source, the lens, and us, and to determine fundamental properties of the universe.  The main question to be answered by this project is: Do the properties of the most massive objects in the universe, which are acting as lenses, match those from astronomer's predictions from simulations of the unverse? If so, they can be used to understand more fundamental problems.  If not, astronomers will have a better understanding of what needs to be done to their simulations to improve them.  This project is possible now due to an increase in the number of observed lensing objects.<br/><br/>In addition to the scientific portion of the project, the PI to increase diversity among American scientists by working with six Deaf undergraduate students from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, as summer co-op students at the University of Chicago. By engaging them in scientific research early in their academic careers, this project aims to open career paths that they would otherwise be unable to tread. The students will develop a mobile app as a portal for ""citizen science""; and the project engages the broader public by enabling participation in the visual classifications central to the scientific analysis. Unlike prior efforts in citizen science in astronomy, this program aims to reach citizens through their now most commonly used electronic tools (tablets and phones) and by casting much of the interaction in a more ""game-like"" setting using an app, rather than webpages. The students will be encouraged to participate in outreach activities, particularly to the broader Deaf public in Chicago, with the aim of sparking interest in STEM studies in yet younger citizens.<br/><br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cosmological simulations are becoming the backbone of analysis for a wide range of extragalactic data. These analyses are numerous, spanning our efforts to understand all observable discrete extragalactic objects, integrated direct backgrounds from X- rays to the radio, and the influence of all that structure on the observed cosmic microwave background, as well as the scientific exploitation of that wide range of signals. Simulations are central to the planning and deployment of major new facilities and experiments. As simulations develop in complexity and scope, and impact, it is paramount that they are rigorously tested against a broad range of observables. This testing is critical as a check of algorithms and simulation contents, and as a test of the physics that the simulations evince. Strong lensing by the most massive halos (from galaxies and clusters of galaxies) in the universe is a unique point of connection between cosmological simulations, and the real cosmos. Robustly predicting strong lensing, given a simulation, requires only some fairly simple ray tracing. By comparing the two largest samples of massive strong lenses against the largest existing simulations, this proposal will address unambiguously a long-standing doubt in the literature: Namely that the correspondence between real and simulated universes in this regime is poor. If the proposed comparisons refute this long-suggested concern, a major challenge to the existing model and the simulations that evoke it will be effectively retired. Conversely, if this long held problem is reinforced, then the proposed detailed examination of the statistics of lensing will illuminate why, and how simulations must be advanced to ensure correspondence. Either result will move this field forward, significantly. Comparisons between simulations and observed real samples will be made across many lens and lensing properties, testing the match or lack thereof in multiple ways, across the entire relevant redshift column, and two decades in halo mass. Such an analysis has never before been possible or attempted, and is possible only now due to rapid advances in both real strong lensing samples, and simulations."

Intensity mapping aggregates the signal from numerous undetectable galaxies to capture the distribution of molecular gas through three-dimensional volumes of the universe, across the sky and back into cosmic history. To achieve this goal, the team will mine the archives of the largest radio telescopes and conduct new experiments using advanced instruments.

The implementation of this work is centered on paid research experiences for cohorts of STEM majors who are at risk of leaving the university.<br/><br/>The proposed research will measure the growth and consumption of molecular gas across the last 10 billion years of cosmic history. Molecular gas is the raw material that powers the process of star formation in galaxies, and a chart of its history can contribute significantly to our understanding of the process of galaxy formation. Unlike the stars themselves, the cold gas from which they form is very faint and hard to observe beyond the nearby universe. The proposed project will overcome this challenge through the technique of ""intensity mapping,"" in which the light from tens of thousands of galaxies is integrated together to generate a detectable signal despite the fact that few of the galaxies can be seen individually. The team will use a variety of data sources to assemble a comprehensive picture of the molecular fuel, including archival data from radio telescope arrays and experiments designed specifically for this type of measurement. The work will culminate in a large program of intensity mapping with the TIME multi-pixel spectrometer, which will be installed on the 12m ALMA prototype antenna of the Arizona Radio Observatory. As part of this program, the PI will use radio science and digital signal processing hardware to enhance the teaching of critical science topics at all levels, from undergraduate general education to upper division majors and graduate students.

(AUI) will manage the operation of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2015, maintaining the strong reputation of NRAO as the premier radio astronomy observatory in the world. The research community will be provided cutting-edge<br/>capabilities: the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the most precise filled-aperture, fully steerable radio telescope; the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), replacing the Very Large Array, already the most productive radio telescope ever built; the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with micro-arcsecond<br/>astrometry, the highest resolution imaging telescope at any wavelength; and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), with unprecedented millimeter-wavelength sensitivity and resolution. All will operate with state-of-the art instrumentation, advanced data processing, and broad user<br/>support, enabling the entire astronomy community to address key problems in astronomy and astrophysics.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The opportunities for astronomy and astrophysics research have never been richer. The unique NRAO radio telescopes will complement the next generation of large ground based optical telescopes and space-based facilities covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Together they<br/>comprise a comprehensive suite of powerful tools to probe and decipher the full range of outstanding problems, from the origin of planets, stars, quasars and galaxies, to the structure of the Universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Observations with VLBA, EVLA and ALMA will shed new light on<br/>exoplanets, and planetary and stellar formation and evolution. EVLA and ALMA will image the gas and dust of the first galaxies near the end of the epoch of reionization and normal galaxies beyond z~1. VLBA microarcsecond astrometry is making possible a new class of precision measurements of the parallax of premain sequence stars, recoil motions of stars in response to exoplanets, the structure of the Galaxy and the dynamics of the Local Group of galaxies. Accurate pulsar timing with the GBT is enabling high precision<br/>tests of General Relativity in the strong field limit and detection of the stochastic background of nanoHertz gravitational waves. Multi-epoch high resolution VLBA images will lead to a better understanding of relativistic jets from micro-quasars and supermassive black holes found in Active Galactic Nuclei, along with the nature of gamma-ray bursts seen by the GLAST satellite. GBT will discover new megamasers, and follow-up VLBA observations will provide the angular-diameter distance determination of galaxies in the Hubble flow, leading to a more accurate determination of the Hubble Constant, higher precision determination of cosmological constants, and better constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT: NRAO facilities are used by more than one thousand scientists each year and are available to all scientists based on the intellectual merits of the proposed studies, independent of institutional or national affiliation. NRAO will provide end-to-end user support at its science centers, enabling easy<br/>access to its telescope and their data by the entire astronomical community. Calibrated images will be made available in archives accessible to both the broad research community and the public through the Virtual Astronomical Observatory. Astronomy is an important element in meeting national goals related to diversity, science and technology education, and increased U.S. competitiveness. NRAO is attracting an increasingly diverse staff. Through the undergraduate Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and co-op programs, resident graduate fellowships and external student grants, Green Bank and Socorro summer schools, and competitive postdoctoral Jansky Fellowships, it continues to help train the next generation of scientists. The Green Bank Science Center, the VLA Visitors Center, US-Chile teacher/student exchange programs, and teacher and K-12 education programs, further serve to create a science-literate public."

The aim of this project is to bridge the gaps that separate scientific communities studying the complex atmospheres of Earth, other solar system planets, and planets around other stars (""exoplanets"").  These different systems are united by the same physics and chemistry used by geo-scientists at Earth and by astronomers investigating other planets in our solar system and throughout the Milky Way galaxy.  Common themes need common approaches, and results at one location can validate less certain findings elsewhere.  This program will create pathways of communication that utilize resources more effectively, promote common modes of data analysis, create all-purpose ionospheric models, and foster student training that removes discipline barriers.  The impact of ionospheric disturbances due to Space Weather experienced at Earth (e.g., GPS degradations) will enable parallel studies for Mars, where multiple satellites need reliable communication and navigation for land-based rovers and, ultimately, human exploration. <br/><br/>While the Sun's ultraviolet and x-ray light is the same for all of our planets, the gases present at each location are different, and this leads to a vast set of ions and electrons that comprise the ionosphere at each planet in our Solar System. Even more compartmentalized are studies of ionospheres at planets around other stars. The scientific communities that study them (geophysicists and astronomers) are isolated from each other - programmatically at funding agencies and at professional meetings and societies. This lack of cross-fertilization impedes progress. This award focuses upon the treatment of fundamental atmospheric and space plasma processes as universal - rather than as unique, planet-by-planet, phenomena.   The team will develop the first comprehensive archive to host all of the parameters necessary to conduct comparative studies of ionospheres throughout the solar system and beyond, and provide a versatile user-friendly model to do so. The research tools developed will offer many opportunities to resolve important issues in one discipline by applying knowledge and expertise found in other disciplines."

The rate at which these massive stars lose matter is an important quantity in determining how these stars evolve near the ends of their lives.  There are, however, large uncertainties in the measurements of mass-loss rate for these stars with major discrepancies between theoretical and observational results.  The goal of this project is to measure mass loss from massive stars through a unique program that involves ""citizen science"" called Zooniverse.  <br/><br/>This project will use the Zooniverse citizen science program to enable thousands of non-scientists to comb through recently completed Spitzer and WISE space telescope surveys in search of bow shock nebulae.  These bow shock nebulae are indicative of runaway massive stars ejected from their stellar birthplaces.  It is expected that the citizen scientists will identify approximately 300 massive stars through their bow shock structure.  These identifications will be followed up by spectroscopic measurements with the 2.3m Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) in order to derive mass-loss rates, which will result in a statistically compelling sample of objects for comparison with theoretical models.<br/><br/>Both PIs are heavily involved in the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, and the proposed work will further strengthen the students' exposure to astronomical research.  The observations with WIRO telescope will foster mutually beneficial exchanges between the urban, predominantly Hispanic undergraduate institution Cal Poly Pomona and the rural University of Wyoming through hands-on observational astronomy and data analysis.  The Cal Poly Pomona proposal in this collaboration is a Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project, which will offer numerous opportunities to train new scientists with a strong emphasis on recruiting students from underrepresented groups into STEM fields.   This project will also initiate a Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at WIRO that will pair secondary science teachers with University of Wyoming faculty and summer Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program students."

Such understanding is necessary to uncover the history of our Universe and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Many research projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  Observations of nearby dwarf galaxies and of very distant galaxies hold clues about the nature of galaxy formation during the first billion years of the Universe, and these first galaxies are being detected by the Hubble Space Telescope and will be further elucidated with the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018.  To accurately interpret and connect these nearby and very distant galaxy observations, precise computer simulations that consider the entire star formation history are essential.  The purpose of this project is to make detailed computer simulations of the formation process of nearby dwarf and distant ultra-diffuse galaxies.  These simulations will track the complete star formation history of dwarf galaxies including their earliest stellar and galactic ancestors.  This project meets the national need to develop US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training students in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and software engineering, which will enable these students to excel in a competitive job market.  In addition, the investigators' research activities will be integrated into the teaching of astrophysics in K--12 schools and other public venues, such as planetariums, television shows, and online learning environments, where the audience can digest the latest advances in computational astrophysics in a visual and intuitive manner.<br/><br/>More technically, this project has the following goals: (1) to explore formation scenarios for ultra-diffuse galaxies in cluster environments and to determine whether they are related to the formation sequence of dwarf spheroidal galaxies; (2) to construct novel, efficient, and accurate methods for radiation transport; (3) to correlate the high-redshift environment of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution to present-day characteristics---star formation histories, metallicity distribution functions, stellar kinematics, and [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] evolution; and (4) to determine the chemical connection between the first stars and metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies.  This project will  support the development of a hybrid radiation transport solver that incorporates the advantages of both ray tracing methods and moment methods.  This method will be utilized in a suite of radiation hydrodynamics simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies, following their complete star formation, starting with individual massive metal-free stars.  The simulation data produced during the course of this project, as well as various data products, will be made publicly available through the nascent National Data Service.  These data will be usable by the astrophysical research community and will enable researchers to address a much broader range of questions than this project alone."

All these populations formed more than 8 billion years ago and must be younger than about 13.7 billion years old, the age of the Universe.  For perspective, the Sun is about 4.5 billion years old.  Yet, the ages of each of these Galactic populations is uncertain to one or two billion years.  Without better knowledge of the ages of these populations, astronomers cannot answer fundamental questions about the formation of the Galaxy.  To progress on these questions, astronomers need to improve how they determine the ages of stars.  The investigators developed a new technique that more precisely determines the ages of stars than any prior technique.  This technique takes advantage of data from the Gaia satellite and advanced Bayesian statistics.<br/><br/>The project will train physics, mathematics, and software engineering students at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in modern statistical and analysis methods.  The students will gain valuable experience working with researchers and students abroad.  The team includes the statistics group at Imperial College in London, England, and the Gaia research group at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany.

Therefore, the project will improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in the United States.  It will also contribute to a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Many types of stars are presently used as age proxies, yet among them white dwarf stars hold the most promise.  A white dwarf's luminosity directly encodes its age, but this relies on accurately measuring its distance.  The Gaia satellite is currently measuring the most accurate and precise trigonometric parallax distances ever obtained.  Among the ~1.7 billion stars that Gaia is observing, there will be ~15,000 white dwarfs within 100 pc with typical distance uncertainties < 1%.  This compares to only two white dwarfs with distances presently known this accurately.  The proposers will combine these Gaia data with optical and near-infrared photometry from ground-based surveys.  They will analyze these data with their well-tested modeling technique, which relies on Bayesian statistics and state-of-the-art model ingredients.  These unprecedented data and new modeling technique will allow the proposers to (1) derive ages for thousands of white dwarfs with typical age precisions of 1 to 5%, and then subsequently determine (2) the star formation history in the disk, (3) the onset and cessation of star formation in the thick disk, and (4) the mean age and age dispersion of the halo."

Advances in material growth driven by the defense and surveillance markets have yielded lower-cost IR sensors of the semiconductor InGaAs, with sufficiently low noise to detect faint astronomical sources.

This removes the requirement for cryogenic optics and vacuum cryostats, greatly reducing system cost and complexity relative to traditional IR imagers with HgCdTe sensors. During each year of a 5-year baseline survey, WINTER will monitor the entire Northern sky to a depth of J=19.2 (single visit), or J=20 (combined), and release calibrated images and transient alerts to the public. WINTER is sensitive to emission from the r-process enhanced ejecta of kilonovae over the full horizon of Advanced LIGO, and will autonomously interrupt its sky survey to search for the isotropic infrared counterparts of gravitational-wave events.  WINTER's IR capability is uniquely sensitive to emission from both binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers independent of viewing angle, opacity, mass ratio and remnant lifetime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the stars form, they add energy back into their environment ('feedback') and influence the birth gas cloud. This feedback appears as fast-moving gas, which sometimes looks like large bubbles. The data are complex, so identifying feedback is difficult. Typically, astronomers have found the feedback ""by eye"", which is subjective and time-consuming. A new field of computer science, machine learning, provides an alternative approach to find feedback. In machine learning, computer algorithms are trained to identify features in the same way the human brain recognizes objects - like cats, dogs and cars.  The investigator's group will use state-of-the-art models of forming stars to train machine learning algorithms to find feedback. They will apply the algorithms to telescope observations and compare with the feedback sources previously found by humans. <br/><br/>The investigator will share the models with the public through the Milky Way project, which is an online astronomy program that trains people to identify feedback in telescope images of gas clouds. The program will also train students in research techniques, including undergraduates from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The proposal addresses a fundamental star formation question:  How much mass and energy is associated with stellar feedback in the interstellar medium?  To answer this question, the PI and collaborators will use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of forming stars, for which full feedback information is known, to train machine learning algorithms to identify and quantify feedback. Dust and molecular line 'synthetic observations' will be produced and used together with observational data as a training set.  The investigators will compare the machine learning identifications to prior visually identified feedback catalogs, including those from the citizen-science Milky Way Project, create an updated census, and publicly release the algorithm and data to the community. The broader impact objectives are to increase public participation in the Milky Way Project, develop a WorldWide Telescope tour on feedback, and train students, including undergraduates in the Texas Astronomy Undergraduate Research experience for Under-Represented Students (TAURUS) summer program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A galaxy's growth may be affected by processes within the galaxy itself and/or by its environment.  Such growth is measured by the rate of new star formation.  Galaxies can be found among vast aggregates of matter which are called filaments; alternatively, they may be isolated from one another.  Galaxies found in filaments typically grow more slowly than isolated galaxies.  Finn and collaborators seek to understand why filaments quench star formation.  This project will combine imaging of the gas that fuels star formation in galaxies with observations that reveal the resulting star formation.  Investigators will compare galaxies in both types of environment to determine the method of star formation quenching.  Their results will challenge theoretical models.  The project will also continue a successful, ongoing outreach to a local high school.  Peer instruction will be added to leverage impact without additional funds.  Kansas, the state where one of the investigators is located, is on the front-lines of the nationwide debate on the role of science in the classroom.  Therefore, this effort to broaden participation in science is especially timely and relevant.<br/><br/>This project will combine a large imaging survey in H-alpha and observations of neutral Hydrogen (HI) and molecular gas (CO).  The project has three specific aims.  The first aim is to directly measure whether the amount of neutral and/or molecular gas available to eventually form stars is measurably lower in filament galaxies compared to those in the field, group, or cluster environment.  The second aim focuses on the spatial distribution of star formation within each galaxy.  This aim will determine whether ram pressure stripping, starvation, and/or mergers are significant mechanisms for quenching star formation.  The third aim uses the results of the first two aims to confront theoretical models of star formation quenching in the context of cosmological structure growth.  The Data Management Plan includes release of the main data products:  H-alpha + continuum maps of 200 galaxies and HI and CO measurements.  Ancillary and raw data will be released upon publication and archived."

The Milky Way is our most important reference for understanding the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe around us. It is the only galaxy where we can observe individual stars, like our sun, in detail. However, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about the Milky Way and the structure we see today. We still do not know the mass of our Galaxy to within a factor of two. The most accepted model for how galaxies form is that galaxies grow by merging with smaller satellite galaxies.  The investigators will check this model by optical observations of ancient stars in the outer parts of the Milky Way, called the Halo. Using optical spectra, the investigators will measure the abundance of elements in these stars, which can tell us about the original, smaller, galaxies in which those old stars were born. When combined with other observations of these stars, the investigators will be able to answer basic questions about the history of our own Milky Way galaxy.<br/><br/>The deep spectroscopy of stars in the galactic halo add line-of-sight velocity, chemical abundance information and improved distance estimates to the proper motions for these stars.   The investigators' observations will determine the three components of the velocity, three components of each star's position in the Galaxy and a critical seventh dimension elemental abundances of the star. The spectroscopy and proper motions will be measured for main sequence stars as distant as 90 kpc. In total, this program will obtain spectra for 450 main sequence halo stars over 11 different lines of sight in the halo. These data contain unique information about the growth of the Milky Way's stellar halo and accretion of satellites, which will be used to reconstruct the mass accretion history of our Galaxy. Furthermore, the full phase-space information will be used to measure the total mass of the Milky Way; an important, yet poorly constrained, astrophysical quantity. <br/><br/>The transverse velocity information from the investigator's proper motion data will be used to measure the velocity anisotropy of distant halo stars. The velocity anisotropy is a major source of systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of the total mass of the Milky Way. The investigators will search the multi-dimensional data for substructure in the distant halo, especially substructure from low luminosity satellites. The tidal remnants of these dwarf galaxies have been hidden from previous searches. Measuring the number of low-luminosity halo progenitors will test models for the connection between dark matter sub-halos and dwarf satellite galaxies. This is an important consistency test of the predictions of cosmological galaxy formation models. From the three dimensions of velocity, the investigators will measure the orbits of the progenitor systems that were accreted into the halo. From the metallicities, the luminosities of the progenitors can be estimated. The abundances of the alpha-elements will be measured for the brighter stars in the sample and used to estimate the accretion times of the satellites. The distributions of orbits, accretion times and luminosities of the progenitors defines the accretion history of our Galaxy's halo. <br/><br/>Their outreach plan includes bringing in high school students via the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP).  High school SIP interns work with their mentors on research projects, and past interns have presented papers at Astronomical Society meetings and have been co-authors on refereed publications. The two graduate students will mentor the students in collaboration with the investigators.  This will give the graduate students experience in non-classroom teaching. Graduate students will develop a Python-based research methods module for high school students that draws from the research program. The investigators will work to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through their participation in programs like SIP, Research Methods, the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science and the Project for Inmate Education in the Santa Cruz county jail."

Metallicity can also change because of inflow of gas from the galaxy's surroundings and outflows of gas from the galaxy disk caused by intense bursts of star formation. Once it is in a galaxy, gas with varying metallicity is mixed together by turbulence and flows.  The local metallicity in a galaxy therefore reflects the competition between all of these factors.  These investigators will study the region-to-region variation of metallicity in nearby galaxies to learn about how these important processes shape the heavy element content of galaxies.

A nova is a star that brightens abruptly by a large factor.  Some novae may become as much as tens of thousands of times brighter than our Sun.  The rapid brightening is caused by a runaway thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a white dwarf star; a small star that packs about as much mass as our Sun into a volume the size of Earth.  The white dwarf accumulates the hydrogen that fuels the nova outburst from an ordinary star that is a close companion.  The explosion ejects mass from the surface of the white dwarf, enriching space with heavier elements produced during the thermonuclear explosion.  Although novae have been known since ancient times, and astrophysicists have understood the cause of a nova explosion since the middle of the last century, important puzzles still remain.  Over the past several years, spacecraft observations have revealed that at least some novae emit very high-energy gamma radiation.  This was unexpected and is still mysterious.  Some novae also may be progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, which have significant implications for cosmology.

Nova eruptions are caused by thermonuclear runaways at the degenerate base of an accreted H layer on a white dwarf.  The hydrogen layer is accumulated by mass transfer from a close binary companion star.  During outburst, a nova increases in brightness, in some cases reaching tens of thousands of times the luminosity of the Sun.  A nova explosion ejects as much one ten-thousandth of a solar mass from the white dwarf into the interstellar medium, enriching it in heavier elements produced in the nuclear burning event.  During the past several years, the Fermi Gamma Ray Observatory has discovered that some novae emit high-energy gamma radiation; the origin of these emissions is still not well understood.  Some novae also may be the precursors of Type Ia supernovae, which have important implications for cosmology.

This project will obtain new constraints on this epoch and the first sources of light by applying novel methods to astronomical data collected with the largest telescopes. These data will be compared to state-of-the-art supercomputer models to yield new insights into cosmic history. This project will support the research of a PhD student, partially support a postdoctoral scholar, and engage undergraduates from two hispanic serving institutions in cutting edge astronomical research. <br/><br/>Determining exactly how and when reionization occurred are among the most important open questions in cosmology. Absorption spectroscopy of new large statistical samples of high-z quasars has tremendous untapped potential.   This project will study the statistical properties of Ly-alpha; absorption in the spectra of z ~ 6 quasars. By leveraging the recent fivefold increase in the number of such quasars, archival data, new methodologies and simulations, this project will enable precise measurements of hundreds of quasar spectra.  This project will: 1) reconstruct the reionization history at a precision that far surpasses existing methods, 2) measure the ionizing photon output from galaxies up to the end stages of reionization, 3) measure the amount of heat that was injected into the intergalactic medium by reionization, providing new insights into what sources (galaxies, AGN, Pop. III stars) re-ionized the Universe, 4) measure the distribution of quasar lifetimes, 5) spectroscopically characterize a statistical sample of recently discovered young quasars. The overarching goal is to elevate quantitative study of the intergalactic medium to be on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is an attempt to understand how interstellar gas and energetic particles are ejected from galaxy disks, where most of the gas and stars are found, and interact with the galaxy halo.  This cyclical process is important for understanding how star formation proceeds in galaxies, and the rate at which galaxies grew when they were forming.  The study makes use of radio images from the NSF-funded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), optical data from the Apache Point 3.5-meter telescope, as well as archival infrared data.  The project will provide opportunities for two PhD student theses at Hispanic Serving Institutions, and the PIs will also contribute to a training program run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for faculty at small colleges.<br/><br/>Galaxy growth and evolution depend on both the acquisition of gas from the galaxy environment and energetic outflows from disks. The detailed physics of these processes needs to be understood, and nearby edge-on galaxies are the best objects where it is possible to cleanly separate disk and halo components. The project leverages a major new survey of radio continuum emission from edge-on galaxies called CHANG-ES (Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies: an EVLA Survey). The first goal is to further our understanding of the dynamics of disk-halo flows by assessing the role of non-thermal gas pressure gradients in galaxy halos, using radio maps made from the VLA and GBT.  The second goal focuses on identifying sites of cosmic ray (CR) injection and propagation into galaxy halos.  For this, the spatial variation of the non-thermal spectral index will be mapped, after robustly separating thermal and non-thermal radio emission using CHANG-ES maps in conjunction with infrared data and H-alpha images.  The third science goal is to examine the connection between CR outflows and disk-halo cycling of thermal gas, and whether this relation depends on factors such as star formation rate."

This will be achieved by mapping the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission in 20 nearby disks at an angular resolution of about 0.04"".  Second, study how these structures affect the distribution of dust grains with different sizes.  To do this, multi-wavelength observations between 0.87 mm and 1 cm, which probe the distribution of mm- and cm-sized dust grains, will be acquired.  Third, measure the distribution of dust particles relative to the molecular gas.  This goal will be achieved by mapping the molecular line emission (e.g., CO) from disks characterized by substructures at an angular resolution comparable to that of the continuum maps.

Neither dark matter nor dark energy is fully predicted or described by any current physical theory. The Dark Energy Survey (DES), being conducted on the 4-meter Blanco telescope in Chile, is designed to measure the properties of these dark components to high precision, and determine whether General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity on large scales.   This project will focus on solving three problems that the DES faces: uniformly calibrating the 100,000 galaxy images obtained by the survey (providing an improvement of 10x); providing accurate redshifts (based on images only, not spectroscopy); and measuring the subtle distortions of the shapes of galaxies to high accuracy to determine the distribution of dark matter.  This work will then enhance the quality of the DES observations so that scientists can better measure the properties of dark matter and energy, as well as those of the other astronomical objects being observed.<br/><br/>Besides these scientific objectives, the project will work with undergraduates (from a variety of educational backgrounds) to develop STEM capabilities.  In addition, this program includes a new partnership with the Franklin Institute for outreach to community-based organizations and middle-school teachers in Philadelphia through Franklin's ""City Skies"" traveling astronomy program and hosted workshops for teachers. City Skies has a focus on historically underserved inner-city neighborhoods. The City Skies project targets development of curricular materials and presentations on astronomical topics. Support from the current project will allow the PI to extend work with Franklin.  <br/><br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DES is collaborative international effort of more than 200 scientists to image one quarter of the Southern sky in 5 colors using a DOE-funded 500 Mpixel camera installed on the NSF-funded Blanco 4-meter telescope on Cerro Tololo, Chile. How can these images measure things that neither emit nor absorb light? First, the dark matter's gravity bends the light emitted by the 5% of the Universe that is visible, causing subtle distortions in the shapes of visible objects. The final DES data will use the ""weak gravitational lensing"" (WL) signature on the shapes of 200 million galaxies to measure the clustering of dark matter to ~1% accuracy. A second gravitational signature of dark matter and energy is that they drive the motions of the visible galaxies, so that the statistics of their positions and redshifts (distances) constrain the dark components; this is especially powerful in combination with the WL information. This proposal focuses on solving three of the most difficult problems that DES faces in reaching its full potential for these measurements. The first challenge is uniform calibration of 100,000 different images taken over 5 years: it will be improved from the current 1% state of the art to near the 0.1% level that was achieved for single nights of the survey using previous NSF support. A second challenge is to measure the WL signature to part-per-thousand accuracy: the proposers have developed the first practical algorithm to attain this accuracy on simulated data, and propose to improve it and apply to the DES images. The third difficult part of the survey is assigning accurate galaxy redshifts without spectroscopic observations of each source. It is proposed to integrate the photometric redshift estimation and lensing measurement into a single process that rigorously treats noise and selection effects to produce a single joint redshift/lensing posterior probability. This in turn enables a new technique for analyzing DES data by creating an ensemble of maps of dark matter density that are consistent with all of the observed positions, shapes, and colors of the galaxies."

PISCO is a professional astronomical camera mounted on the 6.5 meter Clay Telescope.  PISCO has a novel design that allows it to take pictures in four different colors at the same time with four large CCD detectors over a piece of the sky about 1/10th the size of the moon.  While the unique design of PISCO has made it useful for many astronomical discoveries, the principal project for which PISCO was built is follow-up of clusters of galaxies discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT is the most sensitive and highest-resolution telescope in the world for observing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation that arises in the early Universe.   Because the space between galaxies in clusters is filled with hot plasma gas, galaxy clusters appear as a dark spots in front of the CMB.  This is called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.  Among the discoveries by the SPT so far are 530 galaxy clusters, and with a newly-installed highly-sensitive detector called SPT-3G, it will discover thousands more.  When the SPT discovers a galaxy cluster, all that is known about it is its location and the size of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich spot, so follow-up observations by an optical telescope are needed.  Some of those galaxy clusters will appear in existing optical sky surveys, but others will be too faint to appear or will be outside the survey area -- those galaxy clusters will be followed-up by PISCO in this project.  The number and distribution of galaxy clusters provides information about the nature and history of Dark Energy, the mysterious force that dominates the Universe.  Furthermore, PISCO may contribute to improving our knowledge of the mass of neutrinos via ""weak lensing"" measurements of the mass of the clusters. The determination of the mass of neutrino species has been identified as an important next step in particle physics, an advance that may have wide-reaching impacts on physics and technology, including nuclear physics here on Earth.  The Southern MicroObservatory will be part of a network of automated telescopes that can be controlled over the Internet (mo-www.cfa.harvard.edu). The telescopes are designed to enable youth nationwide to investigate the wonders of the deep sky from their classrooms or after-school centers.  This project will support the installation of a robotic MicroObservatory telescope at Las Campanas and integrate it with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Science Education Department Robotic Telescope Network for the online STEM learning community. The maintenance effort will be efficiently shared with PISCO operations.<br/><br/>The South Pole Telescope consortium has completed the SPT-SZ and SPTPOL surveys and is now engaged in the SPT-3G deep millimeter-wave continuum survey that will detect thousands of previously-unknown galaxy clusters and groups through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. PISCO observations will play a key role in the production of a mass-limited redshift-independent catalog of galaxy clusters over ~9% of the sky. This searchable public database will include imaging as well as spectroscopy in the optical, infrared, and X-ray, enabling a wide variety of scientific studies. In this project, the SPT consortium will conduct multi-wavelength follow-up of the new SPT-3G survey in order to complete the SPT Cluster Legacy Archive.  This three-year program will produce photometric and spectroscopic catalogs of volume complete samples of galaxy clusters over a 4000 square degree area of sky. After analyzing candidate cluster positions in existing survey data such as DES and VISTA, the SPT team will: (1) make the additional photometric imaging observations needed for completeness in redshift and mass limit, (2) obtain weak lensing measurements during periods of excellent seeing for a representative (albeit still large) subsample of these clusters, (3) make these evolving data sets promptly available to the astronomical and STEM learning communities in both raw and reduced form, through publications and a web-accessible, searchable archive, and (4) analyze the data for cosmology and the determination of neutrino properties.  The formation of clusters and groups of galaxies is a battle between the gravitational attraction of Dark Matter, the dynamics of relativistic and non-relativistic particles, and the repulsive effect of Dark Energy. Their abundance over cosmic time is a sensitive probe of cosmology that complements and refines other cosmological tests. The redshift-independent archive of ~ 8000 confirmed clusters in this project will be the foundation for profound enhancements in our understanding of (a) fundamental properties of the Universe, including greatly improved constraints on the mass and number of neutrino species and the nature and history of Dark Energy out to z ~ 2, and (b) the astrophysics of galaxy clusters and their intracluster medium, the evolution of galaxies and their constituent stellar populations in high-density environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stars build up the heavier chemical elements needed for planets and eventually for life through a series of processes known as ""nucleosynthesis"".  The earliest stars were likely quite different than stars today.  These old stars, called ""metal-poor"" stars because of their low abundance of heavier elements, were formed from the remnants of the earliest stars. Elemental abundances in metal-poor stars serve as a ""fossil record"" of our Galaxy and can help us understand the beginnings of nucleosynthesis. Testing theories of the early Universe requires very accurate measurements of elemental abundances in metal-poor stars.  An accurate and precise abundance determination for a given element requires, first and foremost, accurate measurements in our laboratories of the atomic transition properties for that element.  The goal of this project is to improve the available atomic data for elements and to use these data to determine highly accurate abundances in metal-poor stars.  This work could also lead to improvements that benefit other fields of applied science, such as lighting and analytical chemistry. Training and mentoring of graduate students and of undergraduates has been, and will continue to be, an important part of this program.  <br/><br/>The University of Wisconsin (UW) program uses techniques involving lasers, powerful spectrometers, synchrotron radiation, and other modern approaches to measure critically needed atomic data. In recent years, a 3-meter echelle spectrometer was developed at UW to measure very weak lines of Fe-group species in the ultraviolet.  Unlike Fourier transform spectrometers, which are often used for such measurements, the 3m echelle spectrometer is free from an important (multiplex) noise source.  These weak lines are needed for abundance studies in stellar photospheres, because stronger lines of the abundant Fe-group elements are partially to deeply saturated and are therefore not good abundance indicators.  The proposed research will extend the range of the 3m echelle spectrometer into the optical for applications in ground-based astronomy.  The first phase of the project will involve developing and implementing a radiometric calibration for the instrument out to the Si detector limit near 10000 Angstroms.  The instrument will then be used for the measurement of weak optical lines of astrophysical interest in the spectra of ions of Fe, Co, and Ni.  These new transition probabilities will be applied to determine accurate and precise abundances in the Sun and in metal-poor stars."

(4) Educational tools on fiber-optics and their use in society will be developed, implemented, and assessed as part of a public project in our Space Place outreach facility, targeted at school-age students and adults.  (5) A four-year lecture series on the Milky Way and external galaxies will be connected to this educational project, presenting expert knowledge on fiber-optic astronomical surveys to the public.<br/><br/>The projects's primary objective is to couple the relative amplitude of rotation and velocity dispersion of gas and stars with stellar ages and abundances, used as chronometers, to probe the dynamical heating of disks over the past 4--6 Gyrs.  This is analogous to what is being measured with resolved stars in ground-breaking studies of the Milky Way, here albeit more coarsely resolved yet broadly applied to a representative galaxy sample over a wide range in halo mass.  This study is leveraged by a new integral-field unit (IFU) on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope and a large IFU survey being undertaken in the fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.<br/><br/>A primary outcome of this work will be to answer the question of whether apparent variations in stellar mass-to-light ratios are due to changes in the stellar initial mass function, uncertainties in the late phases of stellar-evolution, or subtleties in the assumed distribution of luminous and dark matter.  The approach enables accurate measurements of disk mass by explicitly tying the vertical gradients in disk stellar populations into a self-consistent dynamical model.  In so doing, the study determines how recent disk heating-rates depend on galaxy properties and environment, thereby constraining the astrophysical source(s) of this phenomenon.  The project calibrates a method for measuring stellar velocity dispersions via the asymmetric drift between gas and stars, a related dynamical phenomenon discovered decades ago in the Milky Way and now measurable in external galaxies.  The method will be applied to the current generation of integral-field spectroscopic survey data on nearby galaxies and has application at high redshift.  The broader implications of this project include the following:  (1) Determining the vertical heating rate of spiral disks using spectrophotometric chronometers is novel and establishes a concrete picture of the stellar density profile in the largest dissipational structures in the universe.  (2) Coupling differences between stellar and gas kinematics with stellar population ages provides a new means for estimating dynamical mass and calibrating the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations.  (3) Calibrating mass-to-light ratios places stringent constraints on late phases of stellar evolution, the efficiency with which star-formation locks baryons into stars, and the inner density profiles of dark halos."

This project is an attempt to understand how interstellar gas and energetic particles are ejected from galaxy disks, where most of the gas and stars are found, and interact with the galaxy halo.  This cyclical process is important for understanding how star formation proceeds in galaxies, and the rate at which galaxies grew when they were forming.  The study makes use of radio images from the NSF-funded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), optical data from the Apache Point 3.5-meter telescope, as well as archival infrared data.  The project will provide opportunities for two PhD student theses at Hispanic Serving Institutions, and the PIs will also contribute to a training program run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for faculty at small colleges.<br/><br/>Galaxy growth and evolution depend on both the acquisition of gas from the galaxy environment and energetic outflows from disks. The detailed physics of these processes needs to be understood, and nearby edge-on galaxies are the best objects where it is possible to cleanly separate disk and halo components. The project leverages a major new survey of radio continuum emission from edge-on galaxies called CHANG-ES (Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies: an EVLA Survey). The first goal is to further our understanding of the dynamics of disk-halo flows by assessing the role of non-thermal gas pressure gradients in galaxy halos, using radio maps made from the VLA and GBT.  The second goal focuses on identifying sites of cosmic ray (CR) injection and propagation into galaxy halos.  For this, the spatial variation of the non-thermal spectral index will be mapped, after robustly separating thermal and non-thermal radio emission using CHANG-ES maps in conjunction with infrared data and H-alpha images.  The third science goal is to examine the connection between CR outflows and disk-halo cycling of thermal gas, and whether this relation depends on factors such as star formation rate."

Most stars occur in systems containing two or more objects.  Some pairs include a very dense star called a ?white dwarf? ? a star with the mass of our Sun crammed into a volume about the size of the Earth ? plus a red giant star hundreds of times larger than the Sun.  In some cases, called ?symbiotic binaries,? the red giant can transfer matter onto the white dwarf.   Such systems provide clues about the way the evolution of one star affects the other.  They also provide clues about the types of stars that can explode as supernovae, completely disrupting the entire star.  This project will use a robotic telescope called ?SkyMapper? in Australia to search the southern skies for large numbers of symbiotic binaries that previous surveys may have missed.  It will also involve large numbers of amateur astronomers around the world who are members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers.  Their observations will help professional astronomers to determine the true numbers of these systems in the Milky Way Galaxy.<br/><br/>2. Symbiotic stars are binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a red-giant companion.  Understanding these systems may have far-reaching implications for binary stellar evolution and may help to constrain the fraction of SNIa that originate as symbiotics.   Arguing that an important, and possibly dominant, sub-population of such systems may have been missed in previous surveys, the Principal Investigator will mine the data provided by the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey based at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia to determine the true population of symbiotic binaries in the Galaxy.  The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research stems from the potential for discovering large numbers of previously unknown symbiotics, from determining the true population of such systems in the Galaxy, and from the potential impact of these discoveries on our understanding of binary evolution and the origins of Type Ia supernovae.  The project will also help to prepare the astronomical community to deal with the flood of data expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) when it comes into operation early in the next decade.  The project also has unique Broader Impacts: It will foster a close collaboration between the large number of amateur astronomers around the world who are members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) and professional astronomers to support current and future wide-field time-domain surveys, including those involving the LSST."

We cannot go to a star and directly measure its temperature, density, or how it makes energy.  Rather, we discover these things by careful study of their light at different colors.  Complex interactions between atoms and molecules produce light.  The PIs are developing a large computer program, Cloudy, to predict this.  Cloudy solves the complex equations of quantum mechanics and relativity.  Astronomers use Cloudy to simulate what is happening in a distant star or galaxy and predict the emitted light.  This is compared with what is seen through telescopes.  This comparison makes it possible to understand what is happening.  Cloudy is freely available and is among the more widely used codes in astronomy.<br/><br/>The PIs will do two types of broader impact.  They organize international workshops showing how to apply Cloudy to research projects.  The Co-PI, a native of Spain, will visit local K-12 schools with large Hispanic populations.

We cannot directly measure the temperature, density, or energy source for a star or galaxy.  We discover these things by quantitative spectroscopy, the careful study of the observed spectrum.  Astronomical sources are usually far from equilibrium.  Their spectra depend on a number of thermal, plasma, chemical, and condensed matter processes.  Analytical solutions are not possible.  The code Cloudy solves all of this, numerically, to predict the spectrum.  These predictions are compared that observations to infer properties of a star or galaxy.  Cloudy is one of the more widely used theory codes in astrophysics with more than 300 papers citing its documentation per year.<br/><br/>Cloudy has long solved these problems using available computers and atomic data.  The simulations can be improved as computers become more powerful and the atomic data more accurate.  We are developing techniques to improve modeling of the dense gas found near black holes or exploding stars.  A full treatment of the ""Rydberg levels,"" the highly excited orbits of electrons around ions, is the key improvement.

Decades of observations have revealed that other stars also show regular activity cycles.  The solar cycle appears to be an outlier, which may mean that the Sun is in a transitional phase that occurs in all middle-aged stars.  This research program at the Space Science Institute will establish an observational foundation for understanding how activity cycles change over the lifetimes of the Sun and stars, including possible connections to planetary habitability. These developments will also provide insight about the fundamental physics of magnetic dynamos, which operate inside Sun-like stars, in exotic astrophysical environments, and in laboratory plasmas.  The research activities will directly contribute to the training of young scientists in the techniques of astronomical data processing and analysis of time series of observations, through the participation of summer students in the research. The principal investigator will also continue his award-winning monthly science column ""Lab Notes"" for the Boulder, CO weekly newspaper, connecting recent science discoveries with the activities of local scientists and the laboratories where they work.<br/><br/>The researchers will obtain, analyze, and interpret new time-series spectroscopic Ca II H & K (Ca HK) observations of stellar activity in two samples of stars with known rotation rates, designed to probe both the precursors and the contemporaries of the Sun. For a sample of young solar analogs from the Mount Wilson survey that rotate faster than the Sun, the project will obtain queue-scheduled Ca HK observations over several years to search for the relatively short activity cycles that appear to be the precursors of the 11-year solar cycle. The second sample will focus on fainter stars with asteroseismic properties and rotation rates already determined from NASA's Kepler mission, including targets with a range of evolutionary states that span the middle-age magnetic transition. The project will obtain queue-scheduled Ca HK observations of this sample to characterize the onset and duration of the transition, and to place limits on the variability of stellar activity at various stages as the global dynamo shuts down. All of the observations will be obtained using the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These stars have the remarkable characteristic of acting like ultra-bright lasers, emitting radio waves due to the molecule Silicon Monoxide (SiO), which is found in the environment surrounding this type of star. Because of this unique feature, radio telescopes can detect these stars at great distances, even when they are hidden in clouds of dust and gas. The investigators will use the stars to study the structure of our galaxy and understand how our Galaxy is being pulled by the gravity of other nearby galaxies and clusters of stars in our Galaxy. By looking for unusual motions of stars in the galaxy, the investigators can detect the past collisions of dwarf galaxies with our Galaxy. <br/><br/>The investigators will test models for a key feature seen in our Galaxy, ""the bar"", a linear structure extending on both sides of the center of our Galaxy. The bar is thought to partially result from the gravitational pull of clusters of stars and gas. These clusters merged to become part of our Milky Way. In addition to the bar, our Galaxy also shows a ""bulge"" near the center, where stars reach high orbits. In our region of the galaxy the stars are concentrated in a disk. <br/><br/>The researchers will provide student participation opportunities and education within the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. This includes finding minority students to work on the project and concentrating on strengthening female participation. Through this research award, graduate students will be trained and additional undergraduate students will be have to opportunity for summer research jobs. <br/><br/>Specific science goals include the modeling of the dynamics and the structure of the Galactic bulge and the central galactic disk. This data will allow defining the relationship of the bar to the populations of the Galactic plane and Center, and the effect of the strongly boxy potential of the bulge on dynamics, and the presence of a ``long'' bar. In particular, both N-body models and self-consistent models will be compared with direct dynamical measurements from the stellar maser velocities. From near-infrared spectra elemental abundances and properties of the circumstellar envelopes will be determined. <br/><br/>The investigator's studies will also be important for understanding the structure of all spiral galaxies.

One of the most exciting uses of this technology is imaging planets around nearby stars. This team aims to build a device that works using infrared light from the host star (the star that the planet orbits). The device will be used on one of the world's largest telescopes, the Keck II telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. The system works by rapidly changing the shape of mirrors inside the instrument to counteract the effect of ""ripples"" in the earth's atmosphere. The principal investigator, along with a postdoctoral researcher, summer interns, and graduate and undergraduate students from Hawaii and California, will search for planets around 150 small ""dwarf"" stars. Their results will be made available to the broader science community through the Keck Data Archive.<br/><br/>Driven by the scientific desire to study young planetary systems around low-mass M-dwarfs, and the practical need to develop near-infrared (NIR) wavefront sensing and adaptive optics (AO) capabilities for the upcoming generation of 30 meter class segmented-mirror telescopes, the proposers seek to produce a system that operates in the L-band for the Keck observatory. The IR detector technology needed for such a system now exists (in large part through funding by NSF) and will be used by the proposers to build a near-IR, high-order, pyramid wavefront sensor for the Keck II telescope. This system will then be used to conduct an L-band (3 micron) coronagraphic imaging survey of ~150 M dwarfs with the Keck facility instrument, NIRC2. The team will conduct follow-up low-resolution slit spectroscopy observations of any exoplanet candidates found in the L-band survey. Note that M-dwarfs are too faint to observe with sufficient contrast and spatial resolution to detect (even massive) exoplanets with existing optical AO systems. The development of the proposed NIR wavefront sensing system at Keck may be viewed as an enabling technology that could lead to the fabrication of similar units at other, publicly available observatories. It should also be noted that NIR wavefront sensing can be used to extend the performance of natural guide star AO systems to fainter targets, and to increase the sky coverage to regions where only optically obscured or very red guide stars are available."

Heavier chemical elements are produced in stars through a series of processes known as ""nucleosynthesis"".  The earliest stars were likely quite different from stars today.  Old stars, called ""metal-poor"" stars because they are deficient in heavier elements, were formed from the remnants of the earliest stars.  Elemental abundances in metal-poor stars serve as a ""fossil record"" of our Galaxy and can help us understand the beginnings of nucleosynthesis.  Testing theories of the early Universe requires very accurate measurements of elemental abundances in metal-poor stars. Accurate and precise abundance determination for a given element requires, first and foremost, accurate laboratory measurements of the spectral properties of that element.  The goal of this research program is to conduct accurate, high-quality measurements of atomic data for the elements and to use these data to determine highly accurate abundances in metal-poor stars.  This work could also lead to improvements that benefit other fields of applied science such as lighting and analytical chemistry.  Training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students has been, and will continue to be, an important part of this program. <br/><br/>The Wisconsin Atomic Transition Probability (WATP) program develops and applies advanced experimental techniques to measure accurate, absolute atomic transition probabilities.  The transition probabilities are determined by combining branching fractions with radiative lifetimes measured using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence.  In recent years, a 3-meter echelle spectrometer was developed at the University of Wisconsin to measure very weak lines of Fe-group elements at ultraviolet wavelengths but is now optimized to work at optical wavelengths for applications to problems of ground-based astronomy.  These weak lines are needed for abundance determination in stellar photospheres, because stronger lines of the abundant Fe-group elements are partially to deeply saturated and are therefore less ideal as abundance indicators.  This project will complete work on Fe-group elements, with measurement of transition probabilities of weak lines of Sc II and Fe II.  Subsequently, the WATP program will begin work on measuring transition probabilities of the alpha-elements, starting with Ca I.  The newly measured transition probabilities will be used to determine accurate and precise abundances in the Sun and in metal-poor stars, and the relative abundances will be compared to models of nucleosynthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We now know that the Universe consists of billions of galaxies, and many of them harbor regions of star formation. In the Milky Way galaxy we can study this process in unprecedented detail. According to the current theories, stars form in both turbulent and quiescent clouds of interstellar gas and dust. However, the details are still unknown. How exactly one generation of stars leads to the next remains to be determined through a combination of observation and theory. This project is focused on a detailed mapping of the structure of relatively nearby regions where stars form. This will allow us to spatially correlate the coherent groups of stars to the complex net of interstellar medium features and, therefore, further study their interactions. The project has been chosen specifically to introduce students to the nature of scientific investigation. Mapping the Milky Way and investigating how stars are born are ideas that students find interesting and accessible.  Small parts of this project can be isolated as independent research tasks, which creates an inclusive learning environment for undergraduate students with different skills, aptitudes, and preferences. This first encounter with research opens the door to richer research experiences and could lead toward careers in science- and engineering-related fields.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to reassess the structure and star-formation history of the major Galactic star-forming fields. Precise photometric parallaxes will be employed to correlate the spatial distribution of young massive stars to the surrounding structures of interstellar matter. The subsequent star-formation history analysis seeks to reach specific conclusions on still controversial issues, such as star formation hierarchy (clustered or triggered star formation) and multiple stellar generations across star-forming complexes. Interpreting the star-formation scenario within the Galactic disk is always problematic because of the many choices of tracer objects, varied observational approaches, and issues regarding the quantity, quality, and completeness of the observational data. To overcome this, new and existing data will be combined to produce a catalog of Galactic young clusters, OB-associations, and early-type field stars for which photometric parallaxes can be calculated. The catalog will be an excellent source of homogeneous distances and color excesses, and thus a reliable starting point in the study of the Galactic spiral structure to 5-6 kpc. The project is chosen not only for its contribution to the field of astronomy, but also because of its feasibility for faculty and students in a primarily undergraduate institution."

Unlike ""regular matter"", Dark Energy seems to act against gravity and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. This is very confusing, and to explain it, we may have to re-write particle physics or perhaps even the laws of gravity. The best way to answer the question ""What is Dark Energy?"" is to measure the expansion of the Universe farther back in time. <br/><br/>Recently astronomers realized that radio telescopes have the potential to make this measurement better than any other type of telescope. This has never been attempted before, and we are now building telescopes to achieve this goal. However, to be successful we need to understand the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is building radio sources to put on quadcopter drones to fly above the telescope. Using the radio telescope data, the location of the drone (with special position sensors), and some new analysis techniques, we will make a map of our telescope beam. The end result will be an important measurement that helps us understand Dark Energy better. <br/><br/>The accelerated expansion of the Universe was discovered from supernova measurements in 1998 and no fundamental theories for this acceleration have yet been experimentally verified. As a result, cosmologists inserted a new component (""Dark Energy"") into our cosmological models, but the underlying theories to explain the accelerated expansion involve either (i) a modification to General Relativity or (ii) a new particle which would predict a unique time dependence of the expansion rate. Either would revolutionize our current models of fundamental theories of physics. To answer these questions we must measure the expansion history of the Universe across the past 11 billion years and pin down the influence of Dark Energy on the expansion. The most promising path for this comes from measurements of galaxies (measuring > 100, 000 galaxies across a wide swath of the sky). Unfortunately, current and next-generation optical galaxy surveys are restricted in how far back in time they can see due to limitations in detector technology. <br/><br/>Radio telescopes do not have these limitations, and offer a promising solution to make radio surveys of galaxies across most of cosmic time. This measurement has never been attempted before and we are now building radio telescopes designed to achieve this goal. However, we already know that to be successful we must understand our telescope characteristics extremely well, in particular the telescope ""beam"" (like a beam of light, a telescope points at one place and focuses there, and we must know what that beam looks like on the sky). For this CAREER grant, the PI is developing a beam mapper using a quadcopter drone. The PI's team will fly a radio source on the drone above the telescopes and use the radio data and drone position to make a map of the beam. This requires developing a stabilized noise source to be flown on the drone, improved sensors for better drone position accuracy, and new analysis techniques - particularly a mathematical transformation to use measurements made near the dish and infer what they look like on the sky. The end result will be an important measurement for cosmology radio telescopes and a beam mapping technique that is demonstrated to work at the high precision required for Dark Energy science goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are vital for many areas of astrophysics. The most famous sub-class are the Type Ia, which have yielded exciting results about the accelerating expansion of the universe. However, for the next step in precision cosmology, identifications are needed of Type Ia at very large distances, which is difficult, because they are easily confused with other types of Type I supernovae, namely Type Ib/c. This survey will study the observed differences between these supernova types to eliminate mistaken classifications and thus enable a better understanding of the acceleration of our universe at earlier stages in its expansion, billions of years in the past. <br/><br/>While Type Ia are the result of thermonuclear explosions of a  C-O white dwarf in a binary system, Type Ib/c are core-collapse explosions from massive stars, which have been removed of their outermost H layer.  Type Ib/c observations cannot be used to derive accurate distance measurements; however, because their spectra look like Type 1a supernovae, they can contaminate large supernova surveys. This award is to conduct a thorough statistical analysis of optical spectra and lightcurves (records of light emitted over time) of thousands of supernovae in order to distinguish between Type Ia supernova and Types 1b and 1c and remove the impostors from the surveys.   This project will develop the tools needed to quickly and automatically identify and remove Type 1b/c supernovae from surveys.  The PI will provide these tools and methods to the community for future observations with other telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which is expected to yield thousands of new supernova  candidates per night.  The data will also be used to test models of core-collapse explosions of massive stars, which will improve knowledge of stellar evolution.   The PI will train and mentor a graduate student and undergraduate student in research, and she will also collaborate with an external organization to recruit a promising high school student from an underrepresented group in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). <br/><br/>The work will be done through a two-pronged approach: 1) utilizing the traditional spectral template approach with well-established algorithms, and then 2) employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive eigenspectrum bases, which if found in a robust fashion, can be easily used to construct average spectral time-series templates and to identify any new classification schemes within the available data. In addition, the PI will clarify the link between SN spectral classification for SN Ib/c, including those connected with Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and their purported stellar progenitors by testing for hidden He in SN Ic.  This will be done by comparing observed spectra and light curves of a large set of SN Ib/c, for the first time, with those predicted from two competing models.  The PI will use spectra and lightcurves of over 5800 supernova explosions that are recently published (such as WISeREP and SUSPECT) or are in-hand."

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Nearly all galaxies appear to have massive central black holes (BHs)---many with ones much, much larger than our Milky Way's.  Observations reveal close connections between galaxies and massive BHs.  However, the formation of massive BHs, how they grow, and how they affect the galaxy life cycle via feedback remain poorly understood.  Fundamental advances in our understanding of gas transport from galactic scales into galactic nuclei by gravitational torques and in observations of galaxy-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are transforming our understanding of BH growth and feedback and are enabling definitive progress in answering these questions.  This project is a multi-scale simulation program that builds on these breakthroughs and on the investigators' previous analytic modeling.  The project will begin with ultra-high resolution simulations (down to about 0.01 pc) of BH growth and feedback in galaxies and galactic nuclei.<br/><br/>The group will also produce visualizations from their simulations specifically designed to support their education and outreach efforts.  The visualizations, which will include both time-dependent animations and 3-D interactive exploration modules, will be displayed at the Space Visualization Laboratory at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.  The PI, the postdoc funded by this award, and graduate students in the group will volunteer once a month for ""astronomy conversations"" at Adler, which attract up to 300 visitors per hour of all ages.  Through these astronomy conversations, the team will explain the fascinating roles of black holes in galaxy evolution to the public.  They will also integrate educational materials into a year long computational astrophysics course for high school students offered through Northwestern's Center for Talent Development.  In the course, students learn to code in Python and apply these skills to pursuing an independent research project using a large astronomical data set of their choosing.   Videos (which will include explanations of the science behind the simulations and of how they were created) will introduce the students to a new kind of simulated data set that they can work on for their projects.  The investigators will also continue to actively involve undergraduate students in their research.<br/><br/>The project's simulations will include an explicit model for stellar feedback that self-consistently produces a multiphase interstellar medium and star-formation driven outflows.  These simulations will be used to study the physics of BH accretion and the interaction of wide-angle AGN-driven outflows in a representative set of model galaxies, including the effects of AGN on gas and star formation, and to calibrate AGN fueling and feedback models for use in cosmological simulations.  BHs will then be implemented in cosmological simulations (about 1 to 100 pc resolution) that will allow the PI to investigate the origin of massive BHs (seed models and the need for super-Eddington accretion), the emergence of galaxy-BH scaling relations, the role of AGN feedback in quenching star formation in massive galaxies, and the effects of AGN outflows on halo gas.  A systematic approach, building up from small to larger scales, will enable the PI to resolve the main uncertainties of previous simulations of BHs on galaxy and cosmological scales.  To maximize the impact of the simulations, radiative transfer calculations, which will allow a direct test of the results with a wealth of current and future observations, will be tightly incorporated in the project.  The goal of this multi-scale BH study is to achieve for BHs a level of predictive power comparable to what has become possible for star formation.  The sub-resolution BH models that will be developed will enable substantially more predictive BH modeling in galaxy-scale and cosmological simulations---thus alleviating arguably the largest uncertainty in current galaxy formation theories."

However, this model requires one very surprising ingredient, an accelerating expansion of the Universe.  This acceleration poses the most profound question in physical science today with even the most prosaic explanations demanding the existence of a new constituent (""dark energy"") with exotic physical properties.  More extreme alternatives include extra spatial dimensions or a breakdown of General Relativity on cosmological scales.  Luckily, the motion of galaxies allows us to probe dark energy and to test General Relativity.  Turning this realization into a precision tool is the goal of this project.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop the insight that large-scale structure can provide as a probe of dark energy and modified gravity.  By combining state-of-the-art modeling and new analysis methods with the massive new data sets being accumulated from redshift surveys, it is possible to simultaneously measure the growth rate of cosmic structure and the cosmological geometry using redshift-space distortions.  The investigators will validate and apply models rooted in perturbation theory to the most constraining subsets of existing near-future data sets to generate a consistent meta-analysis of the current state of the field."

Because of their low mass (thus, low gravitational binding energies), they are the most susceptible to any process that removes or prevents gas from condensing to form stars. However, because they are so dim, the only well-studied sample of faint dwarfs consists of those in the Local Group of Galaxies that includes our own Milky Way galaxy.  This project expects to answer some of the open questions about faint dwarf galaxies using deep imaging data: How abundant are they in the local Universe?  What is the relation between the mass of their stars and their halos of invisible ""dark matter""?  Which processes terminate star formation in faint dwarf galaxies?  The researchers will also leverage dwarf galaxy searches as a way to increase student access to STEM careers. They will develop a dwarf-galaxy-hunting project for gifted high-school students attending the Ohio Supercomputer Center's annual two-week Summer Institute, and increase access to the program including through scholarships to be funded via this project. The team will produce a ""This Is How We Science"" video blog (vlog).  This vlog will follow the researchers through the milestones and daily tasks associated with the project, and will also feature a how-to guide for young students interested in scientific careers.<br/><br/>The project will take a census of faint dwarf galaxies in the nearby Universe using existing deep, multi-wavelength Large Binocular Telescope imaging data from a ""failed supernova"" survey led by the Co-PI.  The 21 host galaxies span the range of galaxy types expected to host most of the faint dwarfs in the local Universe.  Analytic, semi-analytic, and numerical tools will be used to infer the relationship between the stellar masses of the faint dwarfs and their dark-matter halos, and to infer the faint dwarf number density in the local Universe. These models will also be used to investigate the relative strength of environmental, internal, and global quenching of star formation, as a function of host type and faint dwarf stellar mass."

This demand would require the utilization of frequencies over a bandwidth that has been traditionally slated for radio telescopes. This frequency infringement may interfere with reception and interpretation of astronomical data and, as such, compromise the search and discoveries of extraterrestrial intelligence. The project puts forward coexistence strategies where wireless users cause minimum interference to astronomical observations. <br/><br/>The project aims at achieving the coexistence strategies by developing interference mitigation techniques that factor in the high-elevation of the look direction of the telescope compared to low-elevation angles of signals emitted by base-stations and wireless systems. A co-existence strategy calls for authorized broadcast stations and wireless transmitters to cooperate with radio telescopes by reporting their locations and providing properties of their signal structures. Prior knowledge of interference location simplifies its nulling and removal by telescope array of multiple units. On the other hand, the distinction in signal characteristics between astronomical events and those of digital communications enables effective cooperative as well as non-cooperative interference identification and suppression.  The project has the potential to advance spectrum sharing and utilization and therefore enhance the future capacity for U.S. industry and academic institutions in this area of research and development."

Galaxies like our own Milky Way are vast collections of hundreds of billions of stars orbiting in a disk perhaps 100,000 light-years in diameter.  Lurking in the centers of many and perhaps all galaxies are supermassive black holes?mysterious objects containing millions or billions of times as much mass as our own Sun, but crammed into a volume that would fit easily within the inner solar system.  In the past few years, astronomers have discovered luminous flares emanating from the core regions of nearby galaxies.  These are thought to originate from the disruption of individual stars that were orbiting so close to the black hole that they were ripped apart by its strong gravitational force.  The energy emitted as the remains of the star fall into the black hole produces the luminous flare.  The collaborators on this project will carry out detailed numerical modeling of these events and will make publicly available their computer codes.  The collaborators also plan to make their work accessible to a wide audience by teaming experts with students in the visual arts and digital media to produce visual simulations of great power and beauty.  In addition, they will participate in a strong program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>2. Over the past several years, wide-field transient surveys have begun to deliver more and better data about tidal disruption events (TDEs).  A TDE is produced when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the core of a galaxy.  Because the theoretical understanding of such events remains incomplete, the collaborators will bring together experts in numerical hydrodynamics and non-equilibrium radiative transfer to study how matter from the tidally disrupted star loses kinetic energy and accretes onto the SMBH, identify the radiative processes that generate the X-ray/ultraviolet/optical spectra and light curves of TDEs, develop a numerical toolset to be used in analyzing TDEs, and apply it to constrain the properties of the star and the SMBH in observed events.  For TDEs with well-resolved light curves, their models will enable a better characterization of the SMBHs and the dense stellar clusters that surround them.  Building upon existing strengths of the partner institutions, the collaborators will also cross-fertilize the training of computational scientists and students in the visual arts and digital media using state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations as common ground.

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the RF spectrum.<br/><br/>Effective use of radio spectrum is coveted by both active services (e.g., cellular, radar, wireless internet) and passive services (e.g., radio astronomy service (RAS) and earth exploration satellite service (EESS)). It has led to an increasing tension between the growing demand for greater spectrum use by active radios and the pressing need for quiet spectrum by passive systems. The first and foremost step towards alleviating this tension is to monitor the radio frequency environment at high resolution in time, space, frequency, and even some appropriately defined feature space. Although the spectrum monitoring issue has undergone extensive research and radio frequency interference (RFI) detection has been fervently investigated in the remote sensing communities, only limited efforts exist in examining spectrum monitoring from the perspectives of both active and passive systems to conscientiously support coexistence. To support peaceful coexistence on radio spectrum, this project aims to develop efficient spectrum monitoring techniques that provide deep understanding and technological enablers for future spectrum management in the growing presence of active and passive radio services. <br/><br/>Advanced signal processing techniques will be developed to provide high-resolution spectrum sensing at short sensing time, and optimal sensing resource allocation schemes will be investigated to maximize the payoffs of the sensing budget. The proposed research on spectrum sensing will inform and advance the RFI detection and management in support of increased societal and scientific returns from RAS and EESS investments. The developed techniques can also be leveraged by cognitive radio networks for dynamic spectrum sharing, impacting practices of the services like cellular data and Internet of things (IoT). Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the unique interdisciplinary nature of this research, especially through interactions with the scientists at the Arecibo Observatory, and the hands-on experience with its 305 m telescope."

The investigators will use telescopes of the University of Arizona to study Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. They will study the material ejected around nearby LBVs and the connection between SNe brightnesses. The material from the LBVs appears as bright rings of gas surrounding the stars.  The material is visible in observations with optical telescopes and sensitive cameras.  These observations provide the only way to measure the ejected mass and speed, as well as the typical time period between large eruptions.

SNe enrich the interstellar medium with elements, and they can be used probe conditions in the distant universe. The use of SNe to estimate of distances to galaxies hinges upon understanding the connection between massive stars and the various types of SNe they produce. Eruptive mass loss is influential in stellar evolution, and violent eruptions preceding core collapse can lead to some of the most luminous SNe known. <br/><br/>This LBV/SNe connection was initially controversial because stellar models place massive LBVs in an earlier phase, but recently a dramatic confirmation of the connection between LBV stars and SNe was observed.  In 2009 an LBV star was noted in a survey of massive stars, and then in 2012 this star became a core-collapse SNe.  LBV-like eruptions may hold critical clues about stellar instability during the final phases of nuclear burning, vital to understanding core collapse. <br/><br/>During these studies, the investigators will detect a large number of extragalactic transients, and constrain the luminosity, mass-loss rates, duration, and outflow speed of the eruptions. Some of these eruptive transients will soon explode as SNe, so the observations will have tremendous value for understanding the prelude to core collapse of massive stars."

The telescope is a rather unusual design and was built specifically for this purpose. WHAM was constructed and has been maintained and operated for 20 years primarily with NSF funding. WHAM has led to Postdoctoral degrees and active careers in science for a large number of young researchers. After a decade at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona the telescope is now located in Chile. It is operated remotely (over the internet) and can map the Milky Way in the light produced by different atoms and ions (charged atoms).  Since this warm gas is an important component of the galaxy, astronomers can better understand how the galaxy is changing and can test theories of how it was formed and how it is evolving. Graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be involved in data collection and analysis as part of the operations team.<br/><br/>This is a collaborative project from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Space Science Institute in Boulder that seeks to continue operations support for the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a remotely controlled facility that is dedicated to the detection and study of faint optical emission lines in the disk and halo of the Milky Way.  The WHAM facility consists of a 15 cm aperture dual-etalon Fabry-Pérot spectrometer coupled to a 60 cm aperture siderostat, which together provide a one-degree field-of-view on the sky and produce a 12 km/s resolution spectrum across a 200 km/s spectral window.  A CCD camera serves as a multichannel detector, recording the spectrum as a Fabry-Pérot ""ring image"" without scanning. WHAM began operations on Kitt Peak in January 1997 from where it surveyed H-alpha emission throughout the entire northern sky (the WHAM-Sky Survey, or WHAM-SS). Complementary observations of various regions in other diagnostic emission lines were also obtained. WHAM has subsequently been refurbished and moved to Cerro Tololo, Chile, achieving first southern light in March 2009. The WHAM-SS has since been completed, and observations in other lines ([SII] and [NII]) have begun. With this award the team will complete mapping in [SII] and [NII], and extend the WHAM (H-alpha) survey to broader velocities. The overarching goal is to complete existing surveys and support current students through to the completion of existing projects. The combined datasets will be used to probe the composition, temperature, heating, and ionization of the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) and Warm Ionized Medium (WIM). The team will investigate the relationship between these components and regions of active star formation. The WHAM facility can also be used to study the earth's atmosphere, comets, zodiacal dust, and lunar sodium."

Galaxies like our own Milky Way are vast collections of hundreds of billions of stars orbiting in a disk perhaps 100,000 light-years in diameter.  Lurking in the centers of many and perhaps all galaxies are supermassive black holes?mysterious objects containing millions or billions of times as much mass as our own Sun, but crammed into a volume that would fit easily within the inner solar system.  In the past few years, astronomers have discovered luminous flares emanating from the core regions of nearby galaxies.  These are thought to originate from the disruption of individual stars that were orbiting so close to the black hole that they were ripped apart by its strong gravitational force.  The energy emitted as the remains of the star fall into the black hole produces the luminous flare.  The collaborators on this project will carry out detailed numerical modeling of these events and will make publicly available their computer codes.  The collaborators also plan to make their work accessible to a wide audience by teaming experts with students in the visual arts and digital media to produce visual simulations of great power and beauty.  In addition, they will participate in a strong program to recruit and mentor astronomy students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>2. Over the past several years, wide-field transient surveys have begun to deliver more and better data about tidal disruption events (TDEs).  A TDE is produced when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the core of a galaxy.  Because the theoretical understanding of such events remains incomplete, the collaborators will bring together experts in numerical hydrodynamics and non-equilibrium radiative transfer to study how matter from the tidally disrupted star loses kinetic energy and accretes onto the SMBH, identify the radiative processes that generate the X-ray/ultraviolet/optical spectra and light curves of TDEs, develop a numerical toolset to be used in analyzing TDEs, and apply it to constrain the properties of the star and the SMBH in observed events.  For TDEs with well-resolved light curves, their models will enable a better characterization of the SMBHs and the dense stellar clusters that surround them.  Building upon existing strengths of the partner institutions, the collaborators will also cross-fertilize the training of computational scientists and students in the visual arts and digital media using state-of-the-art astrophysical simulations as common ground.  The resulting visual products will be used to disseminate the results, help to inform the general public about science and the universe, and provide raw material for science curricula, documentaries, and astronomy presentations.

However, the black hole mass is normally calculated by studying the motions of stars in the galaxy, and recent work suggests that the presence of a bar in the galaxy causes a significant perturbation in the stellar speeds, which has not been taken into account.  This leads to a bias that over-estimates the mass and can hide the effect of galaxy type.  This award supports development of a new numerical method that does not suffer from this problem.  Comparison with other methods and careful checks throughout the work will lay the foundations for future better understanding of the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes.<br/><br/>This project will work to correct this confounding factor in understanding how the co-evolution of black holes (BH) and galaxies depends upon the host galaxy's morphological type.  Recent studies show that the unique orbital structure of a bar makes significant changes in line-of-sight velocity profiles, but although nearly 60% of spiral galaxies with existing dynamical BH mass measurements contain bars, all of those estimates were derived using axisymmetric models that do not account for the bar.  The resultant systematic over-estimation bias can mask dependencies on host galaxy morphology.   This study will (a) develop the first stellar dynamical orbit superposition code capable of accurately determining BH masses in barred disk galaxies; (b) run high resolution self-consistent N-body simulations of bars and generate mock kinematic datasets for validating the new code; (c) improve the BH mass measurements in several barred galaxies; and (d) obtain the first stellar dynamical BH mass measurements for two nearby galaxies with independent reverberation mapping (RM) estimates.  Building a new code is crucial because: (1) the predicted over-estimate is comparable to the scatter and thus can mask genuine differences in BH growth mechanisms; (2) using stellar dynamics to confirm RM BH estimates is important for future high redshift estimates where only RM is possible; and (3) accurate BH masses for specific galaxies are critical for modeling the accretion physics of X-ray emitting gas.<br/><br/>This multi-faceted project, involving N-body simulations, code development, and the modeling of real data, will give the graduate student involved the broad and strong technical skills necessary for a successful career.  Other activities will provide future elementary school teachers with strong STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) foundations through the university's school of education, involve non-science major undergraduates through a newly-developed course, and use a summer camp to inspire high school students to pursue STEM disciplines in college."

Because of this unique feature, radio telescopes can detect these stars at great distances, even when they are hidden in clouds of dust and gas.   The investigators will use the stars to study the structure of our galaxy and understand how our Galaxy is being pulled by the gravity of other nearby galaxies and clusters of stars in our Galaxy.  By looking for unusual motions of stars in the galaxy, the investigators can detect the past collisions of dwarf galaxies with our Galaxy.  <br/><br/>The investigators will test models for a key feature seen in our Galaxy, ""the bar"", a linear structure extending on both sides of the center of our Galaxy.

They are the result of concentrated magnetic fields and can be associated with magnetically active regions that produce space weather events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  The study of sunspot dynamics and evolution is an important area of research in the field of solar physics.  Occasionally, regions of brighter material cross the dark center of the sunspot (known as the umbra) to form what is called a ""light bridge"".  This proposal will use the New Solar Telescope (NST) operated by the PI's institution along with satellite-based data to study the three dimensional structure and magnetic fields associated with these light bridges.  The proposed research will support the training of the next generation of solar scientists.  The PI will involve both a PhD graduate student and an undergraduate summer student in the proposed research. <br/><br/>This proposal will investigate the dynamics of light bridges observed in the umbra of sunspots and the associated activity in the chromosphere, the corona, and the transition region between the two. This research is motivated by the capability to make high-resolution observations of sunspots using the NST.  Targeted observations will study the fine-scale structure of the chromosphere and the transition region above sunspots.  Phenomena such as umbral jets, dynamic fibrils, and structured up-flows seen in the chromosphere and the transition region suggest that the dynamics are relatively unexplored and not well understood.   The proposal describes four major goals of the work including:  1) measuring and understanding the dynamics magnetic fields in sunspot light bridges, 2) studying the shape of anomalous Stokes profiles in sunspot light bridges and determining their roles in triggering energetic events, 3) investigating the connection between photospheric dynamics and chromospheric/coronal outflows, and 4) studying the spatial structure, dynamics, and spectral properties of umbral flashes and spikes.  The work outlined in the proposal will provide important preparatory science beneficial to the science planning and success of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST)."

These waves would have left a unique signature in the polarization of light from the early universe. Discovery and characterization of this signature would open a new window to the early universe and also connect quantum mechanics with gravity, an objective at the frontier of physics. To accomplish these goals, this project will realize the most transformative and broadest reaching cosmological analysis of a unique polarization measurement with the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS). By sponsoring the cosmological research of the PhD students who built and operated CLASS, the project trains the next generation of trailblazing scientists.

The primary goal is to detect and accurately characterize the imprint of Inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Another goal is to make a cosmic-variance limited measurement of the CMB E-mode polarization on the largest angular scales to pin down reionization. The CLASS survey is unique: It is the only large scale measurement with broad frequency coverage that probes the full range of angular scales on which inflation and reionization leave their strongest signatures. This study will characterize the primordial B-modes using both reionization and recombination signals across 70% of the sky from 40 to 220 GHz, eliminating systematic errors and testing predictions for the angular spectrum shape and isotropy of the inflationary signal. Because the public survey data will overlap other large-scale surveys from the radio to the X-ray, the scientific legacy of the survey will greatly extend its intellectual merits. An important impact will be the fostering of the next generation of scientists. The project supports cosmological capstone research for graduate students who have built and operated the telescopes. It also builds a bridge for inclusive research and coursework at the undergraduate level. Public talks, school visits, and online media further engage the broader community in the exciting science of the early universe."

The telescope is a rather unusual design and was built specifically for this purpose. WHAM was constructed and has been maintained and operated for 20 years primarily with NSF funding. WHAM has led to Postdoctoral degrees and active careers in science for a large number of young researchers. After a decade at the Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona the telescope is now located in Chile. It is operated remotely (over the internet) and can map the Milky Way in the light produced by different atoms and ions (charged atoms).  Since this warm gas is an important component of the galaxy, astronomers can better understand how the galaxy is changing and can test theories of how it was formed and how it is evolving. Graduate and undergraduate students will continue to be involved in data collection and analysis as part of the operations team.<br/><br/>This is a collaborative project from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Space Science Institute in Boulder that seeks to continue operations support for the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a remotely controlled facility that is dedicated to the detection and study of faint optical emission lines in the disk and halo of the Milky Way.  The WHAM facility consists of a 15 cm aperture dual-etalon Fabry-Pérot spectrometer coupled to a 60 cm aperture siderostat, which together provide a one-degree field-of-view on the sky and produce a 12 km/s resolution spectrum across a 200 km/s spectral window.  A CCD camera serves as a multichannel detector, recording the spectrum as a Fabry-Pérot ""ring image"" without scanning. WHAM began operations on Kitt Peak in January 1997 from where it surveyed H-alpha emission throughout the entire northern sky (the WHAM-Sky Survey, or WHAM-SS). Complementary observations of various regions in other diagnostic emission lines were also obtained. WHAM has subsequently been refurbished and moved to Cerro Tololo, Chile, achieving first southern light in March 2009. The WHAM-SS has since been completed, and observations in other lines ([SII] and [NII]) have begun. With this award the team will complete mapping in [SII] and [NII], and extend the WHAM (H-alpha) survey to broader velocities. The overarching goal is to complete existing surveys and support current students through to the completion of existing projects. The combined datasets will be used to probe the composition, temperature, heating, and ionization of the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) and Warm Ionized Medium (WIM). The team will investigate the relationship between these components and regions of active star formation. The WHAM facility can also be used to study the earth's atmosphere, comets, zodiacal dust, and lunar sodium."

One important aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is to study the supermassive black hole (called Sgr A*) at its center and how the black hole interacts with the rest of the Galaxy.  The proximity of Sgr A* provides an excellent laboratory in which to investigate two intertwined processes: how stars are formed in the vicinity of the black hole and how their stellar winds are subsequently captured.  This project will apply observation and theory to identify sites of current star formation very close to Sgr A* (within 2 parsecs) and will test ideas about how stars are formed in this environment.<br/><br/>The investigators have an extensive history in communicating science and research to the public and are committed to continuing these efforts over the course of this project.  The team also includes two graduate students who have developed Galactic center lessons, some of which incorporate the WorldWide Telescope (WWT) visualization system, for high school and community college classrooms throughout the Chicago area.  The team will create and share two WWT tours on the topic of the Galactic center and the Milky Way Galaxy.  Team members will use data, WWT tours and videos in public talks on the Galactic center black hole, a very popular topic to schools and numerous astronomical societies.  The team will make FITS images related to this project available to professional and citizen science communities.  They will make JPEG images from the FITS files and embed Astronomical Visual Metadata information into the image headers.  The FITS and JPEG images, WWT tours and videos will be hosted at Northwestern University and will be accessible through a searchable content-managed web site.<br/><br/>This project will examine star formation where the tidal and radiative effects by Sgr A* are significant.  Their multi-wavelength approach (e.g., VLA, ALMA, VLT, SMA and CARMA) will examine water masers, compact H-II regions, SED fitting of protostars, proplyds and SiO outflows in the molecular ring and will identify protostellar outflows lying within 2 pc of Sgr A*.  In addition, the team will determine the mass accretion rate onto Sgr A* by measuring the mass loss rate of ionized winds from young stars using radio techniques.  The processes that lead to accretion are closely related to star formation in the nucleus of our Galaxy as well as in the nuclei of galaxies that host massive black holes.<br/><br/>Detailed observations of the inner parsec of the Galactic center have primarily been conducted at infrared wavelengths using Keck and VLT telescopes.  The recent upgrading of the VLA and commissioning of ALMA present an opportunity to apply novel techniques at radio and millimeter wavelengths to examine two related topics, star formation and accretion onto Sgr A*.  These new capabilities will allow the team to use massive stars to register the radio and infrared frames with milliarcsecond accuracy and to determine the proper motion of stars orbiting Sgr A*.  The accurate positioning of stars near the supermassive black hole will probe general-relativistic curvature of space-time by measuring periastron shift.  The investigators will use a novel pragmatic approach to studying the disk mode of star formation near the tidally stressed environment of Sgr A*.  The project may have far reaching implications on the nature of star formation and AGN activity in the nuclei of more active galaxies hosting massive black holes."

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>Meeting national goals for expanded commercial access to the RF spectrum requires transitioning to a new Spectrum Access System (SAS) framework that will support more extensive sharing of the spectrum. Legacy spectrum management relies too heavily on segregating radios into static exclusion zones. The goal of this project is to address this challenge by studying and developing new frameworks for supporting dynamic exclusion zones that will enable much finer-grained, dynamic management of spectrum resources in multiple dimensions (i.e., time, space, and by user-class) to facilitate increased sharing among all classes of spectrum users, including those that rely on passive sensing systems. <br/><br/>The proposed research has both technical and economic components. For the technical component, it will develop a framework for implementing Incumbent Protection Zones (IPZs) that take advantage of the SAS database and spectrum sensing data to adjust the geo-contours of exclusion zones dynamically. This will expand opportunities for Secondary Users (SUs) to co-exist with Incumbent Users (IUs) without causing harmful interference.  For the economic component, the project will investigate a new spectrum access right for invoking an Option-to-Exclude (OTE) other radios from transmitting in IU spectrum. The plan is to integrate the IPZ and OTE concepts in a game theoretic model.  In addition, it will carry out detailed case studies that consider real-world challenges of sharing government spectrum with commercial users in the 3.5 GHz, 5 GHz, and AWS-3 bands.  This research is intended to provide a practical framework that is both technically and economically viable for implementing incentive-compatible dynamic sharing solutions as part of the SAS framework."

There are many discrepancies between dark matter sub-structure in the existing computer simulations and in observations.  There are too few massive satellites relative to simulations, and at low Galactic latitudes there are hardly any Milky Way satellites.  This project aims to extract essential information on the dark matter distribution in spiral galaxies by building on the investigator's ongoing work in characterizing galactic satellites from analysis of disturbances in extended disks of hydrogen gas.<br/><br/>Communicating scientific results to a broad audience and promoting diversity benefits the astronomy community and our society at large.  This project will be carried out at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), which has historically been primarily an undergraduate institution:<br/>(1) Women in Science: The PI will organize regular meetings with visiting women colloquium speakers, with the goal of gathering advice on professional development.  Dr. Chakrabarti will also continue participating in the Expanding Your Horizons program, which is geared towards engaging middle school girls in science.<br/>(2) Computational Bootcamp:  Every summer, the PI will provide a two-week, intensive computational bootcamp geared towards entering graduate students. The goal of this bootcamp is to serve as a bridge---providing an introduction to computational astrophysics, with hands-on lectures that illustrate the basics of computing and applications to astronomy.

Three-D movies are becoming an increasingly popular tool to engage the public and are effective in widely disseminating research on galaxy evolution.<br/><br/>The PI will carry out the following technical tasks:<br/>(1) The Milky Way:  By matching simulated orbits of the Milky Way satellites with HST proper motions and tidal debris, the PI will derive constraints on the orbital parameters, as well as the initial stellar (and dark matter) distribution of the Milky Way satellites.  The PI will produce models that are consistent with both the HI and stellar data of our galaxy, which displays large ripples in the outskirts, a prominent warp, and vertical waves in the galactic disk.<br/>(2) Probing The Dark Matter Halo:  Dark matter halos evolve as a function of time, and they may have complex shapes.  The PI will determine if the inference of the halo potential from stellar streams is viable for time-varying potentials.  By deconstructing the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation ERIS, the PI will study if the distribution of satellites and the morphology of the gas and stellar disk is representative of the Milky Way or local spirals.<br/>(3) Shaking and Rattling The Local Spirals:  By simulating a wide range of encounters with sub-halos from cosmological simulations, and mapping to multiple observational constraints in a statistically robust manner using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis, the PI will produce realistic mock catalogs and evolutionary histories of HI disks and their satellite populations.<br/>(4) Strong Spiral Lenses in HI:  As the SWELLS sample is a sufficiently low redshift sample of strong spiral lenses (z_avg ~ 0.1) showing visible signs of interaction, the PI will compare and contrast the team's HI analysis and gravitational lensing to derive two independent constraints on the dark matter distribution."

Galaxies were just beginning to form from the matter created in the Big Bang, and the intense radiation emitted by these galaxies was burning away the fog of hydrogen gas permeating deep space.  In less than one billion years the fog had cleared, and the young galaxies lived in a Universe where ultraviolet radiation could travel freely through space.  This transformation of the gas in deep space is known as ""cosmic reionization"", and it was a landmark event in the early Universe.  By studying reionization we learn not only about the history of matter in the Universe, but about the formation of the first galaxies.  The goal of this project is to connect the changes we see happening in deep space during reionization to the characteristics of the first galaxies themselves.  How can we combine observations of galaxies and deep space to learn more about this era of cosmic history?  What imprints on the Universe does reionization leave behind?  The PI will use the world's largest telescopes to directly probe both galaxies and intergalactic gas over the same regions early in cosmic history.  The observations will be combined with state-of-the art computer modeling to better understand how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it impacted early galaxies and the matter in deep space.  Building on this research, the PI will integrate his observational expertise into local high-school and undergraduate education.

The first galaxies formed in a Universe filled with dark matter and cold, neutral gas.  As the radiation from these galaxies permeated deep space, however, the gas was ionized and heated, rendering the Universe transparent to ultraviolet photons.  Thirteen billion years later the gas in deep space is still highly ionized.  The early transition from neutral to ionized was therefore the last phase transition of matter in the Universe.  Known as ""reionization"", this transformation was a key event in cosmic history.  <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to determine when and how reionization occurred by simultaneously studying the gas in deep space and the galaxies embedded within it.  The PI will use the word's largest telescopes to study galaxies (via wide-field imaging) and intergalactic gas (via absorption-line spectroscopy) in the same cosmic volumes during and after reionization.  Spectroscopy will also be used to study the gas in and around galaxies themselves.  These will be the first observations to directly connect the evolving conditions in deep space to the sources driving the evolution.  By further combining data with state-of-the-art modeling, this project will provide a better understanding of how cosmic reionization occurred and the ways in which it shaped early galaxies and intergalactic matter throughout the Universe.

Observations of open clusters show that among stars of a given age, the rapid rotators tend to be binaries.  This could be because of tidal effects acting over 0.01 - 10 billion years or interactions between the binary companion and the protoplanetary disk during the first 10 million years.  Both effects would cause binary stars to rotate faster than single stars, thus affecting angular momentum evolution in the binary systems.  Douglas will combine rotation periods and binary orbital parameters to explain why rapidly rotating stars tend to be binaries.  Douglas will use photometry, spectroscopy, and light curves to identify candidate binaries as well as new radial velocity observations to measure orbits.  These data will allow her to test how binary companions affect stellar rotation over time.

Any clusters that are confirmed at very great distances add significantly to the few that are known.  This project employs a unique method for identifying new, distant clusters of galaxies, and this sample of distant galaxy clusters will help in determining the epoch of galaxy formation, in studying the galaxy populations of clusters over time, and in constraining cosmological models including dark energy. <br/><br/>Clusters usually contain bright elliptical galaxies near their centers, and these galaxies host supermassive black holes in their cores.  Accreting supermassive black holes produce jets and lobes detected in the radio, and these jets and lobes become distorted as they interact with the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM).  These distortions sometimes result in the lobes being bent in the same direction, resulting in a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology.  Significant groundwork has been laid in studying the cluster environments of WATs at low-to-moderate redshifts.  In addition, a large sample of 653 WATs with cluster environments too faint (and therefore distant) to be studied with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been assembled.  All of these objects are being observed in the infrared with Spitzer.  Based on cluster association rates at lower redshift z, this project's sample is expected to reveal approximately 400 new clusters at z > 0.7.  Follow-up deep optical imaging is the next step in the survey and will be achieved using the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT).  By the nature of their selection, all the clusters will contain radio-loud active galaxies, allowing the study of active-galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback at high redshift.  Poor, low-mass clusters at high redshifts are particularly important for studying AGN feedback and for constraining models of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum.  High-redshift, low-mass clusters are also the most difficult ones to find using other cluster survey techniques, making this survey particularly useful because it will locate distant clusters with a wide range of masses.<br/><br/>Research results of this project will be included in undergraduate classes.  Students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will be involved with all aspects of the project.  The Principal Investigator (PI) will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, who will accompany the PI on observing trips to the telescope.  The PI will engage the community through public elementary school visits and collaboration on science museum exhibits.  Students and the PI will participate with public outreach efforts with the Discovery Channel, including films and online science reporting."

As such, blazars provide a direct view of how energy is radiated away and degraded in and around fast moving plasmas.  Unfortunately, the current explanations have proven inadequate.  This research team has introduced a new model that looks very promising in initial, approximate, studies.  This project will use new computational techniques to simulate the motions of large amounts of high-speed plasma, to study the problems in sufficient detail to distinguish between the possible alternatives by comparing with astronomical observations.  The research tool developed for this work will be packaged for others to use in many areas of plasma science.<br/><br/>Blazars are the primary sources of persistent extragalactic gamma-ray radiation detected by ground- and space-based observatories.  They provide a direct view of dissipation and radiative processes in relativistic collisionless plasmas.  Recent observations of rapid intense flares imply that the emitting regions are very compact and propagate with much higher Lorentz factors than the bulk jet values deduced from radio observations.  A semi-analytical model using localized, relativistic sub-flows, called minijets, has reproduced the main features of flaring blazars, but is based on crude approximations.  This project will use a new, fully radiative Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code to study collisionless reconnection in relativistic plasmas, including the effects that plasma magnetization, the strength of the magnetic guide field, and the plasma composition, can have on bulk plasma motions, particle acceleration, and radiative signatures.  Simulated time-dependent spectra will be compared to existing data.  The puzzling gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula cannot be due to shock acceleration or any other magnetohydrodynamic process, and this research team's comprehensive model is the first compelling case for reconnection as the main dissipation mechanism in a distant astrophysical system.  The present work will study the bulk kinematics of relativistic reconnection outflows, the effects of plasma composition on reconnection outflows, and radiation processes in these self-same outflows.  These will be the first kinetic simulations to model relativistic reconnection in an electron-ion plasma, and among the first to treat radiative losses self-consistently.<br/><br/>The powerful research tool used here will be made freely available, with all necessary documentation, test problems, diagnostic tools, and sample scripts.  The study itself applies widely not only to other astrophysical systems such as pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, and accretion disk coronae, but also to space physics applications and laboratory plasmas.  One postdoctoral researcher will be supported, trained, and mentored in high-performance computing and the use of simulations."

Galaxies, containing visible, baryonic matter in stars and gas, are embedded in vast dark matter halos. (""Baryonic matter"" in the Universe primarily consists of protons and neutrons, and the chemical elements based on those particles.) Galaxies, therefore, can be used as visible probes of dark matter's role in the formation and evolution of large-scale structure in the Universe, a fundamental problem in modern cosmology.  This project aims to improve our understanding of galaxy assembly and the relationship between dark and baryonic matter. The researchers will expand and improve simulations and statistical tools used to understand the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos. They will study the influence of environment and cosmic time on the properties of galaxies in dark matter halos. They will create realistic mock galaxy catalogs that will be essential for a better interpretation of upcoming large galaxy surveys. The project will support the mentoring and active involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students in the research program. The PI will also expand a partnership with the planetarium at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate interns and enriching the public understanding of the science from galaxy surveys.<br/><br/>Halo occupation modeling is a powerful theoretical tool to interpret galaxy clustering measurements and constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter. A standard assumption made in these probabilistic models is that the mass of the dark matter halo fully determines the properties of the galaxies contained in it. This project will extend the modeling approach to include cosmic evolution and environmental dependence, two crucial aspects that are currently missing. First, the evolution of the halo occupation models will be studied using semi-analytic galaxy formation models. The dependence of these models on the large-scale environment of the galaxies will be explored using both semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations. These two studies will then be combined to examine the evolution of the environment trends and the environment dependence of the evolution. Finally, this extended modeling approach will be applied on simulated and real data from SDSS."

As a result, large upcoming surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) have been planned to measure weak lensing very precisely.   The objective of this project is to provide accurate theoretical predictions that will eliminate a key source of uncertainty in weak lensing measurements and test their use in analysis of data from an ongoing sky survey.  Work such as this, that will contribute to the solution of the biggest mystery in modern cosmology, will clearly promote the progress of science.  As an additional benefit, the investigators will extend an existing, highly successful educational outreach program (""Space Public Outreach Team"" or SPOT) to the Pittsburgh area, focusing on schools with a significant fraction of under-represented minorities.  This project will have an impact both on K-12 education and undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>Weak gravitational lensing has great potential to solve some of the major outstanding issues in cosmology, such as the nature of dark energy.  However, a major source of uncertainty is that these measurements are typically interpreted assuming that all coherent galaxy shape alignments are due to weak lensing, but unfortunately, galaxies do exhibit coherent ""intrinsic alignments"" with large-scale density fields.  The alignments contaminate weak lensing measurements at a level that will significantly exceed the statistical error bars on weak lensing measurements with the LSST.  This project has three main objectives.  The first objective is to use large volume, extremely high resolution hydrodynamic simulations to further our understanding of the physics behind intrinsic alignments and build improved intrinsic alignments models.  The second objective is to produce mock galaxy catalogs with intrinsic alignments for use in testing intrinsic alignments mitigation schemes.  The final objective is to carry out cosmological weak lensing analysis including strategies to marginalize over intrinsic alignments using improved intrinsic alignment models that are motivated by state-of-the-art simulations, analytic theory, and observations."

Determining the redshift when this occurred and the sources of the photons that ionized the intergalactic gas represents one of the current frontiers in observational cosmology.  The enormous recent progress in identifying populations of high-redshift galaxies, particularly the Lyman alpha emitting galaxies, has the potential to answer the question of when this process occurred. This project will develop large, homogeneous galaxy samples with which to determine the properties of the ultra-luminous galaxies at high redshift.  An important aspect of this project is to provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students that will engage their interest and encourage their participation in science, train them in observational methods and instruments, direct them in computer processing and reduction techniques for large imaging and spectroscopic data sets, and provide mentoring, with a particular emphasis on encouraging women students. <br/><br/>Observations suggesting a drop in the high-redshift Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) fraction beyond a redshift of seven have been interpreted as marking the onset of reionization at this redshift.  However, the most luminous LAEs do not appear to show such an evolution and may also exhibit more complex line profiles than lower-luminosity LAEs, suggesting that the most luminous LAEs are protecting themselves from the evolving neutrality of the IGM by generating highly ionized surroundings.  As a consequence, the galaxy can be seen directly without scattering from the surrounding intergalactic medium.  The aim of the proposed survey is to observe a 120 square degree field to moderate depth using Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope in order to develop a large uniformly-selected sample of very luminous LAEs, as well as a very large sample of more moderate-luminosity LAEs from which we can determine the properties of  LAEs from redshift 5 to redshift 7. From these samples, the researchers will be able to determine how LAEs depend on environment and luminosity in this redshift range, as well as estimate the ionizing photon production in the most luminous LAEs and the growth of HII porosity. Determining properties of galaxies near the reionization boundary, and particularly their ionizing photon production, will provide strong constraints on theoretical models of the evolution of the intergalactic gas, the evolution of galaxies, and structure formation at high redshift."

Initially, the universe was filled with a gas of hydrogen and helium atoms.  Eventually gravity caused stars to form from this gas.  Astronomers have seen distant galaxies--collections of stars--as they looked when the universe was less than 500 million years old.   But the stars in these galaxies are probably not the first stars that formed in the universe.  It is important to determine the properties of the earliest stars in the universe.  These stars created new elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for the first time.  This changed how future stars would form and evolve.  Detecting light from early stars is very challenging.  This research will instead analyze radio observations.  Radio signals from the early universe can record the effects of the first stars indirectly.  By studying these signals, this research will help astronomers understand the role of early stars in shaping the modern universe.  Early-career researchers at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels will be trained as part of this project.  Results from the research will be shared with children and adults at local and regional science events.<br/><br/>The formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes during Cosmic Dawn is the next frontier in observational cosmology.  During this epoch, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is dominated by neutral hydrogen gas, accessible to observations through its redshifted 21 cm line. The thermal and ionization history of the early IGM encodes unique information about the properties of the first luminous objects. Once the first stars form at z ~ 30, they produce a background of Lyman-alpha photons that couple the neutral hydrogen spin temperature to the physical gas temperature in the IGM. This causes the 21 cm line to become visible in absorption against the warmer cosmic microwave background (CMB). Later, X-rays traveling long distances deposit their energy as heat and raise the IGM temperature. This heating drives the average 21 cm signal to switch into emission above the CMB, until the neutral gas is eventually ionized during the epoch of reionization, leaving no detectable signal.   The evolution of these absorption and emission features in the early IGM will be imprinted in the all-sky radio spectrum since redshift maps to frequency for the 21 cm line.  This research will use observations from the EDGES dual-band all-sky radio spectrometer.  EDGES operates in the frequency range between 50 and 200 MHz, spanning redshifts 30 > z > 6.  The goal of the research is to constrain plausible astrophysical model parameters for star formation, heating, and ionization in the early Universe.  Theoretical models from 21CMFAST and other simulation codes will be fit to the observations.  Collaborators will incorporate additional physics into their codes to investigate any contributions from non-standard physics to the data.  This project will provide support for one postdoctoral research and the final year of Ph.D. thesis research for one graduate student.  It will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in astrophysical research, with special efforts to make sure that all interested students at the host institution are encouraged to pursue these opportunities, including students from underrepresented populations and non-traditional backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous observations of the Galactic disk suggest that many of these clouds are filamentary over a wide range of physical scales.  While astronomers agree that stars form within the densest regions of interstellar clouds, they currently do not understand the importance of interstellar filaments for the process of star formation. The only way to measure the three-dimensional structure of interstellar clouds is through spectroscopic radio observations. The investigator will use three spectroscopic surveys in concert to probe both the atomic and molecular internal structure of interstellar filaments within the southern Galactic plane.  The main research objectives are to 1) characterize the velocity structure of the filaments and compare this to numerical models to draw conclusions about their lifetimes, stability and star-formation efficiencies, 2) trace the turbulent structure of the filaments using higher order statistics on both the atomic and molecular observations.<br/><br/>The investigator volunteers with the University of Wisconsin-Madison McNair Scholars Program as a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Professional Advisor aimed at preparing first-generation, low-income, and minority undergraduates for graduate school and beyond.  This research will also provide training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>If filamentary clouds are the only structures with densities large enough to form stars, then the theory of Galactic star formation needs to be focused on the formation and evolution of filamentary molecular clouds, including filamentary sub-structures where proto-stellar activity occurs.  This research project will make a contribution by directly identifying and characterizing interstellar filaments through spectroscopic observations of both their molecular gas and atomic envelopes.  One of the main data products will be a catalog of filaments, along with the results from the dynamical studies done on them. This will allow future research on where proto-stellar activity resides in relation to filamentary structure."

This diffuse gas cycles into and out of galaxies multiple times. It will form new stars and become swept up in violent stellar end-of-life processes. Astronomers believe that this gaseous cycle lies at the heart of galaxy evolution. Yet, it has been difficult to observe directly.  This project will include analysis of new telescope observations of hundreds of galaxies and their associated gaseous halos. Combining these data with large computer simulations will greatly advance the current picture of galaxy evolution.  In addition, the analysis will track how the composition of the gas evolves over billions of years of cosmic history. This program includes an educational component focused on training University of Washington students in scientific research. <br/><br/>Driven by recent advancements in UV instrumentation and computational capabilities, observations and simulations of the diffuse gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) are a new frontier of galaxy evolution studies. This study will directly address key questions about the physical connection between galaxies and their CGM. The observational dataset combines high-resolution HST/COS UV spectra of 30 z=1 QSOs with deep, optical spectroscopy and imaging from Gemini and Keck telescopes of hundreds of foreground galaxies per QSO field. The comprehensive galaxy-absorber catalogs produced by this study will: (1) be 5 times larger than all previous low-redshift samples combined; (2) cover an epoch that has never before been systematically surveyed (z = 0.3 -1; spanning approx. 5 Gyr), and (3) expand the physical distances probed in the halos from 0.5 -3 times the virial radii. In total, this program will constrain the physical properties of gas physically associated with a large, varied sample of galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0.1-1 and compare these quantities with cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. This program will serve as a benchmark for the next decade of CGM studies.  In collaboration with faculty and staff at Seattle Central College (SCC), this program will also establish a multifaceted undergraduate research program designed to facilitate STEM student transfers between local community colleges and the University of Washington and retain, mentor, and financially support transfer students.

The sun formed from the core of a huge cloud of molecular gas in our galaxy. The investigators are studying how other solar systems form from hot gas cooling into dense, dark clouds of molecular gas.  The investigators will map our galaxy to find clouds where stars are formed. They will also study the environment of our galaxy's spiral arms.  The investigators have already mapped many of the positions of the clouds in our galaxy.  Their new study will add a fourth dimension, the cloud speed.  The speed is used to predict where clouds will collide to form spiral arms.  These collisions can result in the birth of new stars.<br/><br/>In partnership with expert 'information visualists', the investigator will bring their findings to the public through digital outreach and direct engagement at science and art festivals. These efforts will be attached to enhanced and interactive visualizations for astronomers. <br/><br/>The processes by which gas flows together to form gaseous structures and stars is both a long and a difficult problem to solve in astronomy. Since the theory of gaseous spiral arms began, there have been arguments over whether spiral arms are long-lived, galaxy-scale density waves or short-lived myths of density confusions. In all of these theories, the spiral arms' gravitational potential brings large-scale combining gas flows. Theories differ on whether these flows are violent, causing shocks, or gentle, merely collecting gas without shocking it. It is not yet clear by what method of combining flows, whether driven by spiral arms or by other means, encourages the formation of giant molecular clouds (GMCs), or indeed whether combining flows are even necessary for GMC formation.<br/>The investigators hope to transform this field by developing and applying a new technique, Kinetic Tomography (KT). KT is a family of methods that transforms already existing astronomical measurements of the interstellar medium (ISM) into a direct measure of where gas is flowing together to form new structures or flowing apart in their destruction, as expressed in the distance-velocity diagram. The proposed work will test and expand the already-functional prototype KT method, which draws on cutting-edge applied math techniques such as compressed sensing. They will measure the rate and structure of convergence and divergence of the ISM, both on the large spiral arm scale and the smaller GMC scale. Furthermore, they will compare these measurements to existing data on molecular cloud structure and predictions from analytic theory and simulations."

Recently, a new type of galaxy was discovered, the so-called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs).  These galaxies contain dark matter but, it seems, little else.  This makes UDGs great places to test theories of galaxy formation.  UDGs could also provide clues about the nature of dark matter.

The team will sift through the data to find UDGs.  Then, they will study the properties of the UDGs.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  The team will partner with the Mount Lemmon Science Center in Arizona.

The NSO provides scientific and technical leadership in helioseismology, synoptic observations of solar variability, and high-resolution studies of the Sun at visible and infrared wavelengths.  The NSO leads a vigorous program in education for public visitors to its facilities, undergraduates interested in solar physics, graduate students conducting dissertation research on the Sun, and postdoctoral researchers needing access to its facilities.   With the construction of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), AURA and the NSO will lead a transformation of current U.S. ground-based solar capabilities into a new era.  When it becomes operational, the DKIST facility will be the largest and most powerful solar observatory in the world providing the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution to allow solar scientists to answer some of the fundamental questions in the field, namely: Why does the Sun have a magnetic field?  How does the Sun produce cycles of varying activity?  What causes sunspots?  How does the Sun produce violent explosions?   While the DKIST facility will provide the high-resolution means to study the smallest details of the Sun, the NSO?s synoptic program provides the long-term, full-disk, monitoring capability necessary to place DKIST observations in context to allow transformative research in solar and space physics.<br/>"

The mix of host stellar system properties (single vs. multiple stars, stellar chemical composition and temperature, etc.) and exoplanet system properties (e.g., number of exoplanets per star, relative arrangements within each system, exoplanet composition) is astonishing and largely unanticipated. Before the origins of that mix can be understood, the nature of the exoplanets and their host stars must be understood. The current observational goal is to classify exoplanets as gas-dominated (like Neptune), ice-dominated, or rock-dominated (like Earth) and then compare those classifications to measured stellar properties. Surely, they must be tightly connected since the stellar and exoplanet systems formed from the same cloud of atomic and molecular gas. During the period of this program, WIYN will be used primarily to study the properties of exoplanet host stars. After EPDS is installed, WIYN will be used to measure exoplanet mass, which is required to determine if an exoplanet is primarily gaseous, icy, or rocky. Research enabled by this program will strengthen the foundations for identifying and characterizing Earth-like exoplanets in the nearby cosmos.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  Open access for enquiry-based research via peer review and open data for all will allow scientists and citizens to engage in the NOAO/WIYN research enterprise no matter who they are or where they work.

The luminous matter in galaxies such as our own galaxy (the Milky Way) resides within more extensive halos of dark matter.  Although the nature of dark matter is still unknown, its effects due to gravity can be studied.  Astronomers use simulations to predict how dark matter halos evolve.  They use indirect means to infer its presence among observed galaxies.  However, the relationship between these dark matter halos and their host galaxies is still uncertain.  Our understanding is weakest for the very lowest mass galaxies and for the highest mass galaxies.  Leauthaud and collaborators will explore both extremes in this innovative observational research program.  Using a new, high resolution imaging survey, they will measure the dark matter halos for tens of thousands of galaxies.  They will compare dark matter to the profiles of luminous matter.  They will focus on dwarf galaxies and giant galaxies where observations are most needed.   This research will lead to new insights into the relationship between dark matter and luminous matter.   Outreach from this proposal will include summer training in statistical and computational methods for undergraduates as part of established programs at Princeton and UC-Santa Cruz.  The Princeton program will work with the National Astronomy Consortium to recruit students from minority and underserved populations.  The UC-Santa Cruz program will recruit students through Hartnell College, a neighboring Hispanic serving institution.  Together these activities will broaden participation in science among historically underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This proposal will advance our understanding of the stellar mass ? halo mass relation that describes the relationship between ordinary matter and dark matter in galaxies.  Indirect detection of dark matter will be made via weak lensing using data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey on the Subaru 8.2m telescope at Mauna Kea.   This project will advance the state-of-the-art for such weak lensing measurements.  In addition, due to the large area of this survey, HSC will detect rare and extremely massive galaxies ( > 1011.5 Msun) that lie at the heart of the largest dark matter halos.   This proposal will identify tens of thousands of such massive galaxies and perform weak lensing measurements on them.  It will also study large numbers of dwarf galaxies ( < 109 Msun) via weak lensing.  Together these studies will reveal the relationship between luminous matter and dark matter for both low and high mass galaxies.  It is in these extremes of the mass range where new measurements are most needed to resolve discrepancies with theoretical models."

Astronomers are currently building the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) in northern Chile.  It will provide a flood of astronomical data when it goes into operation in 2019.  This will greatly increase demand for spectroscopic studies of many interesting targets.  Spacecraft observations will contribute tremendous numbers of additional targets.  To meet these demands, the Investigators will construct a novel spectrograph for the SOAR telescope in the southern hemisphere.  This instrument will use many tiny mirrors to steer light from small patches of the sky into either the spectrograph or an imaging channel.  The Intellectual Merit of the project comes from its ability to provide rapid follow-up observations of LSST discoveries.  It will also enable studies in very crowded regions of the sky, such as the central bulge of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  This project serves the national interest by advancing the quality and type of science we can acquire about the Milky Way galaxy and other discoveries made with the LSST. The Broader Impacts of the project include the involvement of graduate students in all phases of the project.  This will contribute strongly to STEM education in the important area of instrument development.  The Investigators will also explain their research results to the public through press releases and the internet.<br/><br/>2. When the LSST comes into operation in 2019, there will be enormous pressure on 4-meter-class telescopes to carry out immediate follow-up observations as well as long-term monitoring of LSST discoveries.  In addition, there will be a need for spectroscopic observations in crowded fields such as globular clusters, the Galactic Bulge, and the Magellanic Clouds.  To help meet these demands, the Investigators will construct a novel spectrograph for the SOAR 4.1-meter telescope in the southern hemisphere.  The SOAR Adaptive Module Optical Spectrograph (SAMOS) will employ a digital micromirror device as a slit-selection mechanism.  Each randomly addressable mirror can be tilted to redirect light either to the primary spectrograph channel or to a parallel imaging channel.  The Intellectual Merit of the project is that, as an adaptive-optics instrument, SAMOS will be able to respond to demand for observations in very rich fields - such as are needed, for example, for HST or JWST follow-up investigations - as well as for studying LSST targtes.  A Broader Impact highlighted by the proposers is that opportunities for remote observations with SAMOS will make the instrument available to faculty, staff, and students at institutions with limited budgets.  In addition, graduate students at all three participating institutions will be involved in all phases of the project, and research results will be made available to the general public through press releases and the internet."

This technique, known as spectroscopy, can often reveal the underlying processes that govern stars, galaxies and the like.  A traditional astronomical spectrograph obtains color information at the expense of imaging.  However, a modern Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrograph is able to do both.  An IFU obtains an image and a spectrum at each pixel of the image of an astronomical source.  The resulting data cube can be studied to determine the spatial distribution of light across a single extended object, or it can be used to study multiple stars or galaxies at once.   This project will support the development of an IFU system for the Magellan/Clay telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory.  When completed, this instrument will enable a wide range of investigations into topics from the formation of young stars to the dynamics of gas outflows in distant galaxies.  In addition to providing a new tool for research, this project will also serve as an essential training opportunity for students and early career scientists. Live feeds from the telescope will be used in conjunction with undergraduate classes.  <br/><br/>This project builds upon the previous MRI award, 0923160 (PI: Mateo), which funded the development of the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS) spectrograph.   The M2FS system actually consists of two high-performance optical spectrographs that deliver resolution, R, in the range 1000 to 40,000 over a wavelength range 370-950 nm.  Since commissioning in 2013, M2FS has been used to support over 30 distinct science projects proposed by 18 different investigators.  This project will develop multi-mode Integral Field Units for Magellan (IFU-M), to be used in conjunction with M2FS.  One key design innovation that enables this instrument is the use of fiber gangs, which handle O(10) optical fibers at once for faster fabrication and assembly.  Fabrication and assembly will take place at the PI?s lab at the University of Michigan; the completed instrument will be deployed at the Nasmyth focus of the Magellan/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, where it will undergo commissioning and use as a facility instrument."

Moreover, a thorough understanding of how galaxies are built up allows us to use galaxies themselves as sensitive probes of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy that dominate the evolution of the universe. After intensive work by scientists using NSF facilities, we now know that some of the most important phases of galaxy assembly occur during the first half of the history of the universe, in moderately luminous galaxies that have, until recently, been difficult to detect as they appear faint on the sky. This project will use cutting-edge NSF and NASA facilities to investigate the nature of these moderately luminous, distant galaxies, and determine how their properties can be used to understand how galaxies like our own Milky Way formed. This project will also enable important work by other astronomers, by producing data that can be used for a wide range of investigations.  Educational visualizations and lesson plans, made in collaboration with K-12 teachers, will contribute to STEM education.<br/><br/>Obscured AGN and star formation are fundamental to galaxy assembly across the history of the Universe. Of particular importance are the moderately luminous systems - those with log LIR(Lsun) ~ 10-12 - as this is where the majority of black hole mass assembly takes place, and where the main sequence of star formation lies. There remain however critical open questions about obscured systems at z>0.5 - what triggers them, what quenches them, and how their role depends on environment. This project will advance our understanding of how moderately luminous systems contribute to galaxy assembly at z>1 by creating new, extremely deep ultraviolet through far-infrared catalogs across the 38 deg2 of the four DES/LSST Deep Drilling fields (DDFs), and then using these catalogs to study the evolution of high-redshift infrared-luminous galaxies in unprecedented detail. The science goals are: (1) quantify the evolution of the infrared galaxy luminosity function, simultaneously as functions of redshift, power source and environment, over 1 < z < 3 and log LIR(Lsun) ~ 9 - 12.2 (2) perform the first direct measurement of the bright end of the obscured AGN LF at z > 2, without extrapolation from optically selected populations, and (3) measure the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at z<4, to constrain AGN host evolution and stellar mass buildup at this epoch. The full catalogs across all of the DDFs will also be released to the community. This project will also develop interactive, 3D visualizations for use with both undergraduate and high school students.  In conjunction with the Virginia Tech 'PhysTEC' program, the investigators will work directly with K-12 teachers to construct lesson plans and tutorials, which will be freely available to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study is enabled by a special instrument at the 6.5m MMT telescope that is sensitive to polarization while also recording images.  The project will reveal how galaxies interact with their environments.  In addition to this ground-breaking research, the PI will engage in outreach activities.  Such activities will include participating in an astronomy workshop for teenage girls and research and career presentations to a native American community.

The source of their Lyman-alpha emission is not known.  Two possibilities include photo-ionizing radiation produced in situ or resonant scattering of radiation from a central source.   Polarization measurements can differentiate between these mechanisms because resonant scattering leads to large polarization gradients while in situ photoionization produces no polarization.  Zabludoff and collaborators will study a statistical sample of dozens of such galaxies with the SPOL imaging spectro-polarimeter on the 6.5 m MMT telescope.  Analysis of such data will be compared with radiative transfer models to reveal how blobs glow and under what circumstances different mechanisms are responsible.

The enormous recent progress in identifying populations of high-redshift galaxies, particularly the Lyman alpha emitting galaxies, has the potential to answer the question of when this process occurred. This project will develop large, homogeneous galaxy samples with which to determine the properties of the ultra-luminous galaxies at high redshift.  An important aspect of this project is to provide research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students that will engage their interest and encourage their participation in science, train them in observational methods and instruments, direct them in computer processing and reduction techniques for large imaging and spectroscopic data sets, and provide mentoring, with a particular emphasis on encouraging women students. <br/><br/>Observations suggesting a drop in the high-redshift Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) fraction beyond a redshift of seven have been interpreted as marking the onset of reionization at this redshift.  However, the most luminous LAEs do not appear to show such an evolution and may also exhibit more complex line profiles than lower-luminosity LAEs, suggesting that the most luminous LAEs are protecting themselves from the evolving neutrality of the IGM by generating highly ionized surroundings.  As a consequence, the galaxy can be seen directly without scattering from the surrounding intergalactic medium.  The aim of the proposed survey is to observe a 120 square degree field to moderate depth using Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope in order to develop a large uniformly-selected sample of very luminous LAEs, as well as a very large sample of more moderate-luminosity LAEs from which we can determine the properties of  LAEs from redshift 5 to redshift 7. From these samples, the researchers will be able to determine how LAEs depend on environment and luminosity in this redshift range, as well as estimate the ionizing photon production in the most luminous LAEs and the growth of HII porosity. Determining properties of galaxies near the reionization boundary, and particularly their ionizing photon production, will provide strong constraints on theoretical models of the evolution of the intergalactic gas, the evolution of galaxies, and structure formation at high redshift."

Violent, explosive events throughout the Universe often produce relatively brief signals that astronomers detect.  A huge, abrupt increase in brightness accompanies a supernova explosion that completely destroys the star.  The brief ?chirp? of gravitational radiation detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in September 2015 came from the merger of two massive black holes.  And in 2007, a ?chirp? of radio emission lasting a few thousandths of a second signaled the discovery of a previously unknown class of astronomical object.  Astronomers think that this and other so-called ?Fast Radio Bursts? (FRBs) originate in distant galaxies far out in the Universe.  To find out what are the sources of the FRBs, astronomers need to discover many more examples, determine their properties, and if possible identify them with events observed in other ways.  This project will deploy radio detectors at the 1000-foot-diameter radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.  The detectors will conduct automated searches for FRBs and communicate the discoveries within minutes to enable follow-up observations.  The scientists will also share their results to the general public through a public website, a 3D video, and planetarium programs.  Even their undergraduate students will help.  They will convey the excitement of research in radio astronomy to more than 3,600 K-12 students each year.<br/><br/>2. A bright millisecond radio burst discovered in 2007 indicated the existence of a previously unknown population of radio sources.  Recent discoveries of more of these Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) has confirmed the existence of this population, which has been hailed as one of the most important discoveries in radio astronomy in recent decades.  With typical durations of a few milliseconds, FRBs are strongly dispersed in frequency, suggesting an extragalactic origin.  The primary goal of this project is to deploy autonomous dedicated detectors at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico and at the Green Bank Telescope to search for more of these transient events across large swaths of the sky, to make the detections rapidly available (within minutes) for follow-up observations at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and in gravitational-wave data, and to record and characterize the properties of these detections.  The Principal Investigators anticipate finding dozens of FRBs each year as well as possibly discovering bursting Galactic neutron stars and possibly completely new classes of transient radio sources.  The Principal Investigators also have an extensive and well-developed plan to employ their research for broader societal impacts.  These include a public website for rapid dissemination of their results to non-scientists, presentations about radio astronomy by undergraduates to more than 3,600 K-12 students per year, and the development of a 3D video about the research that has strong potential to grab the public interest and teach the public about science through astronomy."

Broader impacts of the work include hands-on training of students and early career scientists developing instrumentation for large area sky surveys.  Expertise will be developed in STEM fields and will lead to skills important for NSF's major new project, the LSST.   The ZTF will conduct an annual time-domain summer school open to students throughout the US, and will share the excitement of the Dynamic Sky with the public via an outreach program at the Palomar Observatory Visitors' Center.  <br/><br/>The facility will conduct a synoptic survey for high-cadence time-domain astronomy with the goal of identifying rare, fast-varying sources. These sources will include supernovae, exotic explosive transients, unusual stellar variables, compact binaries, active galactic nuclei, and asteroids.  The ZTF survey will cover the entire Northern Sky, revisiting fields on timescales of a few hours and providing hundreds of visits per field each year.  This shallow-wide-fast cadence is well suited to detecting fast transients and probing rapid variability. The single-visit depth of 20.4mag is well-matched to current spectrographs on 4-m class telescopes, while the final co-added images will provide wide sky coverage that is about two magnitudes deeper than that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The new camera will have a 47 square degree field of view, larger than the original Palomar Sky Survey which was recorded on glass plates using this same telescope almost 60 years ago.

These smaller galaxies are called dwarf galaxies.  The properties of these dwarf galaxies provide clues to how galaxies form and can test the nature of dark matter.  However, the number of Milky Way dwarf galaxies and their properties do not fully agree with well-established cosmological models.  In order to understand this discrepancy, it is necessary to understand whether the Milky Way and its dwarf galaxy populations are typical of large spiral galaxies, or if the Milky Way is itself an unusual galaxy.  The investigators will identify dwarf galaxies around 50 spiral galaxies similar to the Milky Way.  These systems will be compared to predictions to determine whether the Milky Way's dwarf population is typical, and will provide new insight into the nature of dark matter and into the formation of our own Galaxy.<br/><br/>The investigators work focuses on a key question of interest to the public: What is our place in the Universe? They will integrate results into their array of education and outreach activities, bringing the excitement of this rapidly-advancing field to a wider audience.  They will create a wiki to collect and disseminate teaching resources, with the goal of lowering the bar to introducing new practices into the undergraduate astronomy classroom.  While development of innovative and interactive undergraduate material has accelerated, a survey of university-level science faculty suggests that only a small fraction of this makes it into the classroom. A single well-designed wiki which gathers innovative undergraduate astrophysics teaching resources from the professors who use them is lacking and will significantly increase the use of such material.<br/><br/>The investigators will constrain the distribution of dwarfs around Milky Way-mass galaxies (of which the Milky Way itself is a single example) by observationally identifying dwarf galaxy populations around at least 50 systems down to the luminosity of the Milky Way's Fornax dwarf galaxy (eight magnitudes fainter than the Milky Way). In parallel, they will construct a comprehensive theoretical framework based on cosmological dark matter simulations that fully utilizes the results of the observational program to provide insight into and place new constraints on models of galaxy formation and dark matter physics.  Their goals are to: (1) provide the data and theoretical framework necessary to distinguish between the multiple proposed solutions to the ""missing dwarf"" and ""too big to fail"" problems and (2) provide an improved understanding of the Milky Way itself in a cosmological context."

Optical Interferometers, such as Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), get around this limitation by combining the signals received by smaller telescopes placed a long distance apart.  We are now able to measure the sizes and shapes of bright stars, and we are beginning to be able to image their surfaces.  This team will study the brightness variations on the surface of giant stars, which is caused by convection just beneath the surfaces.  In turn, this will enable a better understanding of how the ""winds"" from these stars replenishes and enriches the interstellar medium, from which future generations of stars (and planets) are formed. This project will be used to train Georgia State University's undergraduate students in astronomy, optics, and computer science. <br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to image the surfaces of a group of chemically-diverse asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars via long baseline near-IR interferometry using CHARA.   The investigators will monitor the lifetime, size, and variability of the AGB convection patterns over the three-year duration of the project.  Their maps of the surface effective temperatures will then be compared to predictions made by state-of-the-art 3D radiative-hydrodynamics models to determine regions of high mass-loss and to determine how that mass is distributed back into the interstellar medium via stellar winds.  Imaging different types of AGBs with sub-milliarcsecond resolution will help quantify the roles of convection, pulsation, multiplicity and magnetism in the variability and mass-loss processes.  The PI will also conduct workshops designed to help broaden the community of astronomers capable of obtaining and analyzing interferometric observations.  They will also develop open source codes to produce images of a wide variety of stars from interferometric data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is important to study because black holes and their formation impact the evolution of galaxies and the production of atomic elements, as well as being a test case for general relativity and physics in extreme conditions.   A research group at Harvard University will study multiple aspects of black hole accretion using computer simulation code developed by the group.  The research will include investigations of (i) accretion onto a supermassive black hole when a star is torn apart by the black hole, (ii) the growth of supermassive black holes early in the universe, (iii) black hole accretion dominated by light subatomic particles called neutrinos in the collapse of a massive star, and (iv) similar accretion when two compact stars, called neutron stars, collide and merge.  This work will form the bulk of the doctoral thesis of a student who is a member of a group that has been traditionally underrepresented in science.   <br/><br/>During the last decade and a half, general relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) codes have been developed and applied widely to black hole systems. The principal investigator of the project has developed the first GRMHD code to include radiation, a program called KORAL, and a radiation post-processor code, called HEROIC, which computes spectra of simulated models.    Three research areas will be explored using simulations with KORAL and HEROIC: (i) Super-Eddington accretion onto a supermassive black hole in a tidal disruption event; (ii) the growth of supermassive black holes between redshift 20, when black hole seeds first formed in the universe, and redshift 6, when distant quasars are directly observed; (iii) Super-Eddington models of quasars and fits to observational data.  KORAL will be modified to handle neutrino emission, absorption and transfer in neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), which are present during core collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.  It will be applied to two problems: (i) NDAFs corresponding to the regimes of radiatively inefficient accretion, thin disk accretion, and super-neutrino-Eddington accretion, with applications to long gamma-ray bursts. (ii) Post-merger NDAFs in double neutron star mergers, with applications to short gamma-ray bursts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is nearly 100 years since American Astronomer Edwin Hubble first showed that galaxies are island universes, containing of billions of stars.  The investigators seek to understand how galaxies form and change over time. Their goal is identifying the star formation processes that produced the wide variety of galaxies observed.  The investigators have selected for special study a set of nearby, gas-rich, galaxies.  These galaxies were found with the Arecibo radio telescope.  These galaxies contain large amounts of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas, the raw ingredient of new generations of stars.  Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate students who work on the project will receive professional development and training in scientific research, technical and mathematical methods, image processing and analysis, and computer programming.<br/><br/>The ALFALFA survey is a HI survey aimed at constructing a statistically-complete census of neutral hydrogen gas in the local universe. ALFALFA covers 7000 square degrees of sky and has cataloged 30,000 objects.  This project aims to measure the optical properties of two specific types of ALFALFA sources: Ultra-Compact High Velocity Clouds (UCHVCs), which are neutral hydrogen gas clouds with properties that make them good candidates for nearby low-mass galaxies, and ""Almost-Dark"" galaxies, which are HI sources with a wider range of possible distances and masses.  Both classes of objects have no clear optical counterpart in existing catalogs, so the objective is to detect and characterize the optical emission from these objects in order to better understand their properties and evolutionary state. To accomplish this objective, the investigator and her students will obtain and analyze deep, wide-field, optical imaging with the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope and One Degree Imager (ODI) of a well-defined sample of UCHVCs and Almost-Dark galaxies chosen from ALFALFA.  The observations will be used to investigate the properties of the UCHVC and Almost-Dark samples and address important questions about how galaxies with neutral gas form and evolve. These questions include: What implications do the UCHVCs have for the ``missing satellites problem''?  What fraction of the UCHVCs have detectable stellar populations?  Are there correlations between the galaxies' environments and locations within the Local Volume and their properties (e.g., the presence or absence of ongoing star formation, their evolutionary phase)?  What is the nature of the Almost-Dark galaxies, and how do their properties differ from ``normal'' galaxies in optical catalogs?  What do the Almost-Dark objects reveal about how star formation takes place in galaxies at the extreme end of the HI mass to optical luminosity regime?  The objects in the UCHVCs sample can also be used to help characterize the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation down to very low galaxy masses (less than ten million solar masses) and to probe the chemical evolution of the Universe.<br/><br/>The investigator has made major commitments to the support and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and to the training of students in research.  The investigator will also work with consultants at the Indiana University Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning to revise a large introductory astronomy course for non-majors.  The investigator will use the data taken with optical and radio telescopes in a course to pique student's interest, help illustrate the concepts being taught, and show concrete examples of how modern research is done in astronomy.  Finally, the investigator will work on advancing science outreach and education through her membership on the Board of Directors of the Maria Mitchell Association, a non-profit research, education, and outreach organization that promotes the legacy of America's first female professional astronomer."

These pulsating stars are very common in the old stellar clusters found in the Milky Way and other galaxies.  These stars are important because they can be used as yardsticks to measure distances on scales of thousands to millions of light years.  Distances are measured using a relation between their variability period (the time it takes these stars to cycle through their brightness variations), and their intrinsic luminosity.  This ""period-luminosity"" relation makes them ideal ""standard candles.""  The investigator will better calibrate measurements of distances across the universe, using RR Lyrae stars.  Accurate distances are needed to better understand the expansion rate and the age of the cosmos.  They also hope to achieve a better understanding of the physics of stars and of the stellar clusters where RR Lyrae stars are found.<br/><br/>The Iowa State University Physics & Astronomy department engages the local community with numerous outreach activities.  The student-run Planetarium shows, in particular, draw large crowds of all ages, and are offered monthly to the public, as well as to the local K-12 schools (over 40,000 students in Ames and nearby school districts).  This project will refurbish telescope equipment previously located off-campus at the Fick observatory facility (now discontinued) making it available to the public as part of a new in-campus, wheelchair-accessible, observation site for outreach activity (e.g., star and Sun parties following planetarium shows for the general public and K-12 students).  They will also prepare two new modules for planetarium shows based on the science of variable stars and the cosmological distance scale as a way to communicate to the local community an example of federally-funded research that is done at Iowa State University.<br/><br/>Since Henrietta Leavitt discovered the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation in 1908, pulsating stars have been an invaluable distance estimator.  More than a century after this groundbreaking result, Cepheids are still the cornerstone of an ever more intricate cosmological distance ladder.  Recent results from the Planck mission, however, reveal some tension between the value of cosmological parameters derived from the study of the cosmic background radiation with respect to ""direct"" measurements still crucially relying on Cepheids.  With this project, the investigators aim to provide an alternative Population II stellar distance estimator based on the newly re-discovered period-luminosity relation of RR Lyrae variables and the availability of high precision parallaxes from the Gaia spacecraft.  The investigators will (1) calibrate the Period-Luminosity-Metallicity (PLZ) and Period-Wesenheit-Metallicity (PWZ) relations for a large sample of Galactic RR Lyrae at optical and infrared wavelengths; (2) use the calibrated RR Lyrae PLZ and PWZ relations to precisely measure Galactic globular clusters' distances and calibrate globular clusters' distance scale estimators, enabling new fundamental tests of stellar evolution and stellar population models; and (3) validate the observational PLZ and PWZ relations against recently developed nonlinear, time-dependent, convective, hydrodynamic models of RR Lyrae stars calculated for a broad range of metal abundances.  The investigators have demonstrated their ability to perform these measurements by completing the analysis of two of the target clusters.  The investigators have all the data and models crucial to this project."

The luminous matter in galaxies such as our own galaxy (the Milky Way) resides within more extensive halos of dark matter.  Although the nature of dark matter is still unknown, its effects due to gravity can be studied.  Astronomers use simulations to predict how dark matter halos evolve.  They use indirect means to infer its presence among observed galaxies.  However, the relationship between these dark matter halos and their host galaxies is still uncertain.

A new approach has been developed that uses parametric statistical techniques to remove most of the stellar signal, and then searches for planetary signals from the residuals.  Preliminary work on the Kepler mission database is showing excellent results, and this study will extend these methods to ground-based surveys.  It is clear that astronomy has not taken sufficient advantage of modern advances in statistical methodology, such as the autoregressive modeling of time series developed in signal processing and econometrics.  This project will start by investigating how well these sorts of models work on typical ground-based cadences, and then test the successes on a photometric database of several million stars.  Autoregressive models will also be tested on a densely cadenced radial velocity survey of bright stars, chosen for the confusing effect of magnetic activity on correlated jitter.  All of the methods developed will be widely promulgated, and can serve a wide range of other time series analysis problems in astronomy.  The exoplanetary community will benefit from the discovery of new candidate planets, uncovering interesting planetary systems, and improving calculations of planetary populations.  The time domain astronomical community will benefit from using autoregressive methods to treat the complex variability behaviors of cosmic populations."

The shapes and colors of galaxies provide important insight into how and when galaxies formed their stars and merged to become larger galaxies.  Dr. Lotz and team will devise innovative software tools to measure the structures of thousands of nearby galaxies, and compare the distribution of shapes of today's galaxies to distant ones observed as they were ~10 billion years ago.  By tracking the metamorphosis of galaxy shapes over cosmic time, and by comparing with simulations of galaxy evolution, the project will illuminate the physical processes governing the evolution of galaxies like our own Milky Way.  The tools developed by this project will help to fully exploit future astronomy surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and  James Webb Space Telescope.  Besides its scientific significance, the project will support the training of a postdoctoral fellow, and the education of a graduate student and a Baltimore-city high school student.  The broader public will be engaged through a related citizen science project to study galaxy images.  <br/><br/>The stellar and gaseous structures of galaxies provide direct insight into their most recent assembly events, as well as longer timescale internal secular processes, both of which drive galaxy star-formation and quenching.  However, the existing coarse structural classifications fail to capture the complex assembly processes responsible for the morphological transformation of galaxies over the past 10 billion years.  Building upon working currently being done for redshifts 0.5<z<3, this project will develop new non-parametric, quantitative measures of galaxy structure, identifying galaxy mergers and classifying galaxy morphology, and apply this approach to nearby galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Optical Galaxy Survey.  This low-redshift baseline will be compared to high-redshift observations by the Hubble Space Telescope to track the emergence of spheroidal galaxies and the frequency of different types of galaxy mergers over time.  In concert with this observational analysis, the investigators will statistically compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from Illustris to the distribution and evolution of morphologies of observed galaxies at redshifts 0<z<3; this will provide physical insights into the measured structural quantities and distributions,  and place constraints on the viable modes for galaxy assembly and evolution."

Bennett (Johns Hopkins University) for the primary purpose of detecting gravitational waves from the first moments of the universe. The polarimeter will be used to answer fundamental questions such as, ""How did the universe begin?"" In cosmology, Inflation is the cornerstone of the standard model, and the polarimeter data will provide a greatly improved limit or discovery of the energy level of Inflation. In physics, detection of a specific polarization pattern would be a detection of gravitational waves. These tests will be made using signals from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), over the full range of angular scales on which the primordial gravitational radiation leaves its strongest imprint.<br/><br/>The proposed polarimeter uses dichroic detectors to operate simultaneously at 130-165 GHz and 200-234 GHz. These bands both provide extra sensitivity for the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) array to the polarized CMB and serve as a sensitive probe to identify and isolate polarized Galactic dust emission. When combined with the lower frequency CLASS instruments, the scientific impact of the original hardware investment is greatly amplified.  The capability of CLASS is accentuated by its sensitivity to angular scales >10 degrees.  From its Atacama site in northern Chile, not far from the equator, CLASS will survey 70% of the sky, overlapping the sky areas surveyed by the other northern and southern hemisphere observatories, and enabling the kind of multi-band data from multiple observatories that has proved so useful in the past. As all CLASS data will be made public, they will be of legacy value to the entire community.<br/><br/>Funding for the development of the dual-frequency polarimeter for the study of inflation and gravitational waves in the early universe is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its participation in the Major Research Instrumentation program."

Astronomers have found convincing evidence that large galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have giant black holes in their centers. These objects can also emit large amounts of energy that can heat and push the gas in entire galaxies. For this reason, black holes can have a profound effect on galaxies over time. There are many questions, however, regarding giant black holes that remain unanswered: How do they form? How do they grow? Are they capable of permanently shutting down the formation of stars in galaxies? Can they affect the distribution of the mysterious dark matter surrounding the galaxies where they live? This project seeks to address these questions by studying a sample of the smallest galaxies - known as ""dwarfs"" - that contain central black holes. Dwarfs have peaceful formation and interacting histories that allow their central black holes to grow in a more passive way than in large galaxies. Therefore, they provide important clues about the formation of the first black holes in the early universe. Samples of dwarfs with and without energy-emitting black holes will be compared to assess the effects of black hole activity on the gas of these galaxies. Observations will also be compared with predictions of computer models that take into account how the universe evolves as a whole. The scientists involved in this project will also conduct an outreach program targeted to groups traditionally less involved in the sciences. Virtual reality multi-sensory resources will be created to help the deaf and the blind experience the universe. These products will be adapted to engage the large Hispanic community in Southern California, and exported to support the PI's ongoing efforts to teach astronomy to AIDS orphan children in Malawi, Africa.<br/><br/>A joint observational/theoretical effort will study the growth of black holes in low mass galaxies with signatures of an active galactic nuclei (AGN). The target stellar mass is in the range between ten million and ten billion solar masses. The team will assemble a sample AGN candidate dwarfs and confirm whether they truly contain AGNs with the use of high spatial resolution spectroscopic observations in optical and near infrared wavelengths. New methods to estimate black hole masses in these elusive objects will be developed and applied to the sample. A matched control non-AGN sample will also be observed. The data will allow for the search and detection of outflows in these dwarfs; the comparison of AGN with non-AGN objects will provide the first estimates of the impact of black hole feedback on the gas content of dwarf galaxies. Other key structural properties of the hosts, such as color/metallicity gradients and kinematics, will be measured to explore other possible effects of feedback. Observational results will be compared to zoom-in cosmological numerical simulations of dwarfs run with different feedback models, including with and without AGN. Simulations will be used not only as predictions, but also to estimate uncertainties due to projection effects, beam size and spectral resolution. The goals of the project can be summarized in two points: 1) help constrain the demographics of black holes in dwarfs, 2) understand the impact of black hole feedback on the structural properties of these galaxies. The expected results of this project can potentially transform our understanding of feedback in dwarfs by shedding light on the energy coupling of black hole feedback to the interstellar medium and providing tight constraints on outflows that can be used to inform the next generation theoretical models of feedback. Further legacy that includes a detailed survey of the stellar properties and kinematics of dozens of dwarf galaxies within 200 Mpc is also expected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Junior researchers and students will learn how to run and to interpret state-of-the-art numerical simulations, and how to carry out data mining on existing observation archives.<br/><br/>The circum-galactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding galaxies that acts as a fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center.

This project applies a new combination of data with models to examine the role of the CGM in galaxy evolution over seven orders of magnitude in physical scale, which is required to truly understand its conditions and kinematics.  The data will be mined from existing archives, and the models will come from a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The rigorous comparison will use a toolkit developed by this team to produce mock datasets from simulations, which can then be analyzed in concert with the real data.  This work should solve several puzzles: 1) although abundant in chemical elements, the dense CGM is not as well-mixed as predicted; 2) galaxies have massive reservoirs of metal-rich gas that should have an extremely short cooling time; 3) the cool CGM is too diffuse to be in pressure equilibrium with a hot galactic corona; and 4) there is just as much cool, neutral gas in the CGM of passive galaxies as in that of star-forming galaxies, so that this gas can be neither fuel for, nor a by-product of, star formation.  This understanding can only be gained by a breakthrough in understanding physics at the scales of the smallest individual clouds that observations can detect, which is not possible except by using multi-scale simulations rigorously coupled to data.  The study will reveal the physical state of CGM gas, constrain the timescales over which CGM clouds evolve, and determine the mass flow rates and total masses moving in and out of galaxies.<br/><br/>These results will be the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved.

The aim of Einstein@Home is to discover new neutron stars, using gravitational wave data from the advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories, gamma-ray data from the Fermi Satellite, and radio data from the Arecibo Observatory and other radio telescopes. Neutron stars, the targets of this search, are extreme objects formed in supernova explosions. Although they are only about ten miles in diameter, they are more massive than the Sun. So far, most neutron stars have been discovered via pulsations that occur when their beamed electromagnetic emission regularly sweeps past the earth. However, while it is believed that the Milky Way contains about a hundred million neutron stars, fewer than 3000 have been detected so far. Gravitational waves might well be the only way to unveil this invisible population of extreme objects. A project run by the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee has three goals to use Einstein@Home to (1) Make the first direct detection of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars, and thus to observe these stars via a completely different physical mechanism, which would carry important new information about their internal structure and composition. (2) Make use of new high-frequency radio data from the MeerKAT telescope array in South Africa to discover neutron stars near the Galactic center. These would give the community a way to study the supermassive black hole that resides there, as well as the dense and active region around it. (3) Use gamma-ray data to identify radio-quiet millisecond gamma-ray pulsars, providing new evidence about the evolution and emission of pulsars. Einstein@Home is an outstanding public outreach effort, allowing people world-wide to contribute directly to exciting and cutting-edge scientific research.<br/><br/>Since it began, Einstein@Home volunteers have donated more than 3 billion CPU-core hours of computing time to the project.

The discovery of new neutron stars in short period binaries and near the Galactic center will improve our understanding of stellar evolution and populations, help study the black hole at the Galactic center, and provide stringent tests of general relativity.

We can measure the mass of a star and how big it is.  We can find out how hot it is and what it is made of.  But to find out how old a star is, we rely on computer models.  Stellar models can be very uncertain; making models requires us to estimate parameters that we are unable to actually measure.  Asteroseismology is the study of stars by measuring the way their surfaces pulsate. Stars like the Sun pulsate, and the frequencies of stellar pulsation carry information about the interior of the star. Asteroseismic data will be used to refine the basic parameters of stellar models and thereby obtain more reliable age estimates.

This program will provide student training in techniques of data analysis, statistics, and computational methods that have a wide range of technical and commercial applications. <br/><br/>Estimates of stellar ages suffer from uncertainties, because parameters that cannot be determined from first principles need to be chosen before models can be constructed.

One in the center of our own Milky Way Galaxy (""SgrA*"", pronounced ""Sagittarius-A star"") has a mass four million times that of our own Sun; the other, in the center of a massive galaxy 50 million light years away (known as ""M87""), has a measured mass several billion times that of the Sun. These regions will be imaged at radio wavelengths, showing detail on the scale of the apparent black-hole diameter (""Event Horizon""). The study of massive black holes has many applications in astrophysics and is of great popular interest; such objects are thought to fuel the most powerful activity seen in far-distant galaxies. Supermassive black holes are extreme examples of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, but the actual mechanism by which they form remains uncertain. Because of the popularity of black holes, the numerous public outreach efforts of this project will enthrall thousands of members of the general public.<br/><br/>The Event Horizon Telescope includes using the recently completed, NSF-funded Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), as well as other large, high-precision radio telescopes worldwide. This project will support assembly of a wideband VLBI correlator to process the torrent (5 Petabytes per session) of EHT data, construction of a VLBI system at the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico, and development of a robust data processing pipeline. Through these developments, the EHT will track time-variable structure at the Event Horizon of SgrA*, and search for periodic signatures of orbiting inhomogeneities in the innermost accretion flow. Observations of M87 will target study of the jet-launching region of a radio-loud AGN, to cleanly distinguish between models of jet genesis whose predictions differ markedly close to the black hole. New polarimetric EHT data will reveal Schwarzschild scale magnetic structures, providing unique constraints on accretion models, as well as General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. <br/><br/>The Event Horizon Telescope will test General Relativity (GR) in the strong gravity limit, and as its ultimate and most fundamental prize, the EHT aims at detecting the signature of the photon orbit (and enclosed ""shadow"") predicted by GR. In addition, while only a few sources can potentially be imaged in the innermost regions, the array has the ability to provide unique and vital time domain information with high angular resolution on the structure and magnetic fields for many other active galactic nuclei (AGN), probing a spatial region of the jet outflow which is very poorly studied with current instrumentation. These topics are all at the forefront of work in AGN physics, and the anticipated data have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of black holes and their environments and to greatly enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of jetted sources.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the work include hands-on training of students and early career scientists in radio astronomy instrumentation and mm/submm interferometry, and those mentored within this project will emerge with unique observational and hardware skills that will be invaluable in the era of ALMA. All EHT data will be made available to the astronomy community, which will maximize its broad astronomical impact across many fields and disciplines, both nationally and internationally. The project includes a public outreach effort through a Scientific American blog, a possible partnership with the Smithsonian Channel, and Center for Astrophysics' traveling exhibition."

With this information astronomers can better understand how stars form in the Milky Way, and how important being a member of a pair can be to the birth of planets.

Together with graduate and undergraduate students at both universities, these researchers propose to analyze Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) radial velocity survey data of 163,000 stars spread throughout the galaxy (disk, halo and bulge) to search for companions to stars with a broad range of stellar spectral types, metallicities, and ages. They will exploit data acquired as part of the SDSS-III/APOGEE-1 high-resolution IR spectroscopic survey, which has already observed over 14,000 stars in multiple (dozens of) epochs. The proposers will complement these data with a new survey, SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2, to extend temporal baselines and the number of observed sources. Their goal is to determine the frequency of companions as a function of host star chemistry, dynamics, evolutionary stage, position in the Milky Way, and environment. They also propose follow-up near-IR speckle interferometric observations of a sample of targets using a new speckle camera on the WIYN telescope, which they plan to build with funds from this award. A pilot spectroscopic survey based on APOGEE-1 data has already produced samples of stellar, brown dwarf, and hot Jupiter companions in a few hundred systems.

With this information astronomers can better understand how stars form in the Milky Way, and how important being a member of a pair can be to the birth of planets. The light from over 163,000 stars will be analyzed over a three year period by graduate and undergraduate students from each university. The data will be obtained using the Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico and the Irénée du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.<br/><br/>This is a collaborative proposal between Steven Majewski of the University of Virginia (UVa) and Nathan De Lee of Northern Kentucky University (NKU). Together with graduate and undergraduate students at both universities, these researchers propose to analyze Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) radial velocity survey data of 163,000 stars spread throughout the galaxy (disk, halo and bulge) to search for companions to stars with a broad range of stellar spectral types, metallicities, and ages. They will exploit data acquired as part of the SDSS-III/APOGEE-1 high-resolution IR spectroscopic survey, which has already observed over 14,000 stars in multiple (dozens of) epochs. The proposers will complement these data with a new survey, SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2, to extend temporal baselines and the number of observed sources. Their goal is to determine the frequency of companions as a function of host star chemistry, dynamics, evolutionary stage, position in the Milky Way, and environment. They also propose follow-up near-IR speckle interferometric observations of a sample of targets using a new speckle camera on the WIYN telescope, which they plan to build with funds from this award. A pilot spectroscopic survey based on APOGEE-1 data has already produced samples of stellar, brown dwarf, and hot Jupiter companions in a few hundred systems. Dr. Majewski is the PI of both the APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 projects."

This model faces two current issues: the current expansion rate of the universe inferred from two different measurements is in disagreement, and the expected size of cosmic structures is also in some disagreement from different measurements. This work focuses on testing those issues by using new data to make an independent measurement of the expansion rate and the sizes of cosmic structures.

Dust reddens starlight, for the same reason that sunsets are red. Astronomers use this map to determine distances to various objects, and to correct for the effects of dust on their data.   The investigators will expand their first work, over the northern sky, using a new southern sky survey to map the 3-dimensional (3-D) structure of the entire galaxy.  The investigator has a plan for improving the accuracy of their map, through averaging the data in a new way.<br/>All maps will be publicly released and will provide a legacy dataset of enormous value for 3-D reddening estimates, stellar stream searches, and other Galactic structure work. They will be available to the general public via the World-Wide Telescope interface, which has over 10 million unique users.<br/><br/>In the process of creating the first-generation 3-D dust map the investigator has identified technical improvements, such as spatial regularization, that would enhance the quantitative reliability of the map.  Rather than computing each pixel of the map independently, the next map will combine information from neighboring pixels to stabilize the fit and allow smaller pixels (both angle and distance) with lower noise.  The new map will also incorporate detailed information on the observational selection function and Galactic priors to make possible an estimate of the number of stars of every type in every volume element.  Inclusion of proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia will stabilize the 3-D fit and increase the fidelity of the map.<br/><br/>Timely data releases spur the advancement of knowledge, and the investigator has a strong record of data releases date back to the first dust maps.  The first-generation 3-D map has already resulted in the release of a molecular cloud distance catalog. The integrated (along each line of sight) map has been tested against emission-based maps and found to agree well.  The improved ""second-generation"" maps of dust and stars proposed herein will be a powerful probe of Galactic structure, and may lead to discoveries of new tidal streams, disk warps, and other features that help us understand Galactic dynamics.  Additionally these maps will provide a foundation for the longer-term goal of a direct calculation of the 6-D radiation field (amount of radiation at every place, in every direction, at every energy)."

These spectra, however, are affected by many sources of noise that block these signal changes from being detected. Astronomers aim to develop ways of separating the signals of the exoplanets from the sources of noise. The hardest stellar noise to identify and remove is caused by spots that change with time on the star's surface. These investigators will look for differences between the signals of passing planets and signals of the surface spots on the star, and use these differences to create computer programs that can detect the differences. The investigators will create false data that can be used to test their programs. If successful, they will then apply these software tools to search data from space-based and ground-based telescopes, where they expect to find hundreds of Earth-like planets. This research serves the national interest by developing and applying new tools to detect planets that could harbor life. The techniques that are developed as part of this research will be included in classes and research at the university level.<br/><br/><br/>Astronomers are now searching for analogs of the Earth. Significant progress has been made in the development of more stable and higher resolution spectrometers with the potential to deliver precision sufficient to detect Earth analogs. However, stellar spectra are laced with quasi-periodic signals that arise from stellar photospheres: granulation, oscillations, spots and plage on rotating stars, and meridional flows. The most challenging of these stellar noise signals for exoplanet detection are spots and plage. The investigators propose to search systematically for differences between Doppler shifts from planets and the photospheric signals from spots and plage. They will use blind source separation techniques with principal component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning algorithms, and multivariate Gaussian process modeling. A large library of simulated data will be created and used to verify the efficacy of the statistical tools for distinguishing Doppler shifts from photospheric noise sources. After validation, the most promising algorithms will be applied to real data from space-based and multiple ground-based telescopes. If signals of the level detected by the spaceborne Kepler telescope can be extracted in the presence of background noise sources, hundreds of Earth-like planets will be detected.

This study will apply advanced methods from the field of machine learning.  Comparing real galaxies from space-based and ground-based data to computer models will make major progress in this all-important field.

This involves several different targeted activities.<br/><br/>Understanding the physical processes responsible for the growth of galaxies is one of the key challenges in extragalactic astronomy.  The assembly history of a galaxy is imprinted in its detailed morphology, but current quantitative classification schemes are only useful for broad binning.  Thus, the comparison of observations with theoretical predictions has only used small samples of visually classified galaxies.  Coping with the large samples needed to disentangle the complex physics involved requires a robust quantitative classification scheme.  This study will implement a promising machine learning algorithm that has proven successful at identifying bars, single-armed or multi-armed galaxies, rings and Hubble type.  The project will: determine a robust quantitative classification and apply it to multiple ground and space based data sets; study the dependence of bars, rings and spiral arms on properties such as mass, star formation, environment and redshift; determine triggering and destruction mechanisms of bars and spiral arms; compare observed trends to those of simulated galaxies; and apply this robust classification scheme to 3D data cubes to compare stellar, gas and kinematic morphologies.  The work for countering the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM fields includes more frequent public observing nights, buying a portable planetarium to encourage daytime visits by university and school students, creating planetarium-based lecture-tutorials and interactive demonstrations for teachers and pupils, and arranging discussions with former physics majors about alternate career pathways."

This project will experimentally study a broad range of collisions between pebble-sized clumps of dust, ice and rock to determine the conditions that lead to growth of larger objects. The results of these experiments will help resolve fundamental questions about a critical stage in planet formation, including the role that water ice and other biologically important molecules play in the sticking process.

These pebbles may grow through pairwise collisional accretion or participate in local gravitational instabilities to form larger km-scale planetesimals. It is possible that some combination of these processes took place, depending on the local conditions in the protoplanetary nebula. A major source of uncertainty in the accretional growth model is the behavior of small objects and aggregates of dust colliding at the low speeds expected (~0.1 - 10 m/s). The proposed experiments would add much-needed data to these models to help determine the conditions under which accretional growth can produce planetesimals and the outcomes of collisions between pebbles in various nebular environments.

It helps sponsor the research and training of the next generation of scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral level.  To ensure that exciting developments in early Universe research reach the broader community, this project focuses on attracting new students to STEM disciplines with public talks and school visits, college-level curriculum development, and high-quality STEM student mentoring.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state of the art for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) analysis tools, with a focus on understanding and developing the role of the new ""messenger method"" approach to map-making and filtering.  It will develop messenger map-making into a production-ready tool and apply it to data.  Ground-based CMB observatories produce maps with complex, anisotropic noise correlations.  Messenger methods can account for wider varieties of such correlations and serve as the basis for new power spectrum estimation tools.  Additionally, messenger methods may allow for multiple tracers of the large-scale matter field to be combined with CMB lensing into a single tomographic matter atlas.  The well-characterized synthesis of a mass map from multiple tracers is important for the epoch of wide field cosmology surveys.  This project will promote the existing ""Saturday Morning Physics"" outreach lecture series at Florida State University and other K-12 activities.  Furthermore, training of students, including undergraduates, helps to prepare the next generation of STEM workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and how these SMBHs are linked to their host galaxies.  Another major question in astrophysics involves the concept of ""dark matter,"" an unidentified type of matter believed to have the properties of gravitation but not to emit any light (hence, ""dark"").  Thereby addressing two major astrophysical problems, this project aims to link SMBHs to the dark matter structure of their host galaxies.<br/><br/>All-sky surveys with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) satellite have now produced groundbreaking data sets, which are used together to obtain constraints on the evolution of structure in the Universe.  WISE uncovered millions of the previously ""hidden"" obscured quasars, rapidly growing supermassive black holes that are shrouded in gas and dust and so are not detectable using traditional ground-based optical and near-IR techniques.  Recently, Planck produced the most precise all-sky map to date of dark matter structures via the lensing of the CMB.  This project will combine these data sets along with ground-based imaging and spectroscopy to obtain a uniquely powerful measurement of the link between rapidly growing black holes and their host dark matter structures by cross-correlating the density field of WISE-selected quasars with the CMB lensing convergence maps obtained from Planck.<br/><br/>In addition, this project will use astronomy to build problem-solving intuition in students through order-of-magnitude (OOM) estimation, or ""Fermi Problems.""  Building on successful OOM activities in introductory astronomy courses at Dartmouth College, the investigators will develop OOM exercises for use at the middle, high school, and undergraduate levels, in which real-world estimation problems are combined with more abstract questions based on astronomical concepts.  The investigators will organize workshops in which teacher participants learn to incorporate OOM activities in their classrooms and help develop new OOM exercises.  Both Dartmouth and the University of Wyoming are located in rural areas, and the investigators will focus on under-resourced schools.  By developing OOM exercises and instructing teachers in implementing them in their classrooms, this project will serve to foster students' problem-solving intuition.  These skills are particularly useful when applying scientific or mathematical thinking to real-world problems, and success in problem solving will help create enthusiasm and future opportunities for students in STEM.  The exercises and teacher reference materials produced by this program will be disseminated to the wider educational community via the web, conferences, and publications, providing a resource for all interested instructors at multiple levels to incorporate OOM activities into their classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will (1) produce the first all-sky measurement of quasar clustering bias using the WISE and Planck data, and (2) directly compare the halo masses of obscured and unobscured quasars, using wide-area deep optical imaging from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and SDSS, and measure the evolution of those biases with redshift, using a technique independent of spatial clustering.  This project will enable a significant step forward in our understanding of the cosmic evolution of black holes and their host halos, and will yield valuable tools for future studies with WISE, Planck, and upcoming ground-based surveys."

It is a flattened disk of stars.  The Milky Way is on a collision course with a similar disk galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy.  Such gravitational interactions between galaxies change the structure of the galaxies.  Tidal forces during the collision produce long streamers of stars that extend hundreds of thousands of light years into space.  These are called tidal tails.  Concentrations of stars in these tails resemble the small dwarf galaxies observed near the Milky Way.  Some tidal dwarf galaxies may separate from their parent galaxies to become independent dwarf galaxies.  Alternatively, tidal dwarfs may disperse with time with their stars being spread throughout intergalactic space.  A third possibility is that these tidal dwarfs may fall back into their parent galaxy.  The number of tidal dwarfs that detach from their original galaxies is not yet known.  The investigator seeks to understand the remnants of these galaxies created during interactions and test whether observations of these dwarf galaxies be used to understand the history of galaxy formation.  The investigator will employ undergraduate students as research assistants.  These students will be trained in data analysis, problem solving, and scientific techniques.  They will be encouraged to present their results at local and regional conferences.   This experience will better prepare the students for careers as scientists, teachers, or data analysts.<br/><br/>The investigator will compare the tidal dwarf galaxies near nearby interacting galaxies and a control sample of isolated disk galaxies.   Ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared images will be searched for possible tidal dwarfs near these galaxies.  The properties of these objects will be compared to those of other dwarf galaxies.  The results will be compared to computer simulations of tidal dwarf formation and evolution.  The final list of tidal dwarf galaxies will be made available to the public.  The results of this project will test theories of galaxy formation.  Galaxy interactions were more common when the Universe was younger.  Tidal dwarf galaxies cannot be easily studied in more distant galaxies.  However, they can be easily studied in nearby interacting galaxies.  The investigator will use archival data from the infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV) and optical telescopes, including the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey.  The interacting galaxy sample includes 46 nearby pairs of galaxies with tidal tails.  The control sample is a set of 39 normal spiral galaxies.  The images around the targeted galaxies will be searched for possible tidal dwarf galaxies.  The UV/optical/IR data will be compared to models of aging stellar populations to determine the average age of the stars in these regions and the total mass of the stars.  The galaxies in the sample have a median distance of only 44 megaparsecs; thus, the survey will be sensitive to regions with star formation rates of 0.001 solar masses per year and stellar masses of 100,000 solar masses.  The numbers of possible tidal dwarfs around the interacting galaxies will be compared with those near the normal spirals to determine whether there is an excess near interacting galaxies."

This covers a wide range of wavelengths. In the radio range, variations had been found for our Sun in the 1940s. In the 1960s, slow time variations of astronomical sources were discovered. Later, radio sources emitting regular pulses were found. In the last few years, non-repeating, bursting sources have been found. One group of the most energetic radio sources is Fast Radio Bursts, or FRBs. FRBs are a rare phenomenon. The study of FRBs is a new one, and their distance and exact location is an open question. If the FRBs are located in other galaxies, the energy of such outbursts would reach the limits of possible emission mechanisms. The appeal of transient phenomena should provide wide public interest. There will be student in topics such as time variable astrophysics, high performance computing and efficient algorithms. <br/><br/>This project will construct a system to search for transient phenomena during scheduled imaging observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA). Images are produced from the average of data over many hours. However, the evidence for rapid variations is lost in the averaging process. This project will construct a system designed to search the data for variability on time scales from 50 milliseconds to minutes, in parallel with scheduled astronomical programs. These searches will be carried out in real time. With the real-time system, only those samples showing significant bursts of radio energy would be stored. This system will be in use at all times when standard scientific programs are carried out, that is, a commensal system. In this, the data stream from the VLA will be searched for significant, short term bursts of radio energy with a powerful, especially designed system. This will not affect the normal scientific observations made with the VLA. The VLA can easily provide FRB positions that have errors smaller than 1 arc second, allowing optical identifications. This system will take advantage of the large amount of observing time available at the VLA, including the 6000 hours to be allocated to the already-planned VLA Sky Survey. This project is a precursor for larger facilities planned for the future, such as the Square Kilometer Array. There will be many opportunities for student training in the algorithms used to search for transient events in large data sets, and there will be outreach at the website of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory."

Our own Milky Way galaxy is regarded as 'normal' in the Universe today, stretching 100,000 light years across and forming stars at a rate of 1-2 new suns per year.  But, as we look farther out into the Universe, it seems that galaxies in the distant past (10 billion years ago) were dramatically different.  Extreme ""starbursting"" galaxies that produced 100 to 2,000 stars per year were much more typical, and most stars formed at that time came from such starbursts.  The awarded team is trying to determine why these galaxies were so important in the Universe's history and why they are so extreme, for example whether or not they are caused by the catastrophic collision of two smaller galaxies, or whether the gas (the fuel needed to power star formation) was more dense and efficient when the Universe was much younger.  These extreme starbursts are also heavily obscured by dust, making them hard to see in optical light visible to our eyes.  Cutting edge radio-wavelength data from the e-MERLIN telescope will be used to peer through the dust and determine the powering mechanism for the Universe's most extreme starbursting galaxies.  This project will support the retention of under-represented students in astrophysics research through participation in the TAURUS program at UT Austin, where undergraduate students spend nine weeks of the summer on a research project.  The awardee will be proactive in engaging and supporting under-represented students in communities like TAURUS.<br/><br/>With a unique data set of high-resolution (0.""1) deep (4 uJy) radio 1.4 GHz continuum data from e-MERLIN covering 1.77 deg^2 in the SuperCLASS field, the awardees will assess the evolutionary origins of highly-obscured radio galaxies in a statistically large sample (few x 100) out to z~3.  The objectives are to answer the following questions: (1) Are the high-SFRs in dusty starbursts primarily driven by galaxy interactions or not?  (2) Does feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in obscured starbursts play a role in suppressing star-formation?  Or is there no discernible difference in star formation seen in starbursts with or without radio-luminous AGN (and what is the dependence on the AGN luminosity)?  (3) What do galaxies' star-formation surface densities tell us about the intensity of star formation and relative obscuration geometries (when compared to optical imaging)?  (4) Can one learn about the physical origins of the mysterious far-infrared/radio correlation by analyzing galaxies' radio synchrotron slope and radio morphologies?  Answering these questions through direct morphological analysis of the e-MERLIN SuperCLASS data products will have significant impact on galaxy evolution studies."

Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they were first detected in astronomical observations of a special kind of galaxy called an ""active galaxy""---distinguished by the fact that a very big black hole at its center is growing at a rapid rate and radiating enough light to heat the entire galaxy. From detailed measurements of that light in thousands of active galaxies, the investigators will learn when and where these black holes grew over the past 13 billion years of cosmic time. They will also connect that growth to measurements of the black hole masses at different epochs in order to form a comprehensive understanding of how and when black holes grew and how much energy was radiated into the galaxy as a result. This in turn supplies a vital ingredient to theorists' models of how galaxies like our own Milky Way formed and evolved. This project will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, learning and excellence through a collaboration with the Meyerhoff Scholars program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. <br/><br/>This proposal will identify up to 16,000 active galaxies in three surveys (called GOODS, COSMOS, and Stripe 82X), which have complementary combinations of depth (sensitivity) and area on the sky. The active galaxies will be identified by the amount of X-ray light they emit. Their distances will be measured using optical and infrared spectroscopic observations at large telescopes to determine the redshift (i.e., the wavelength shift of atomic emission or absorption lines) of a large fraction of the active galaxies. For the rest, the investigators will estimate redshifts by analyzing the total infrared, optical, and ultraviolet light that they emit. Catalogs listing the X-ray, infrared, and optical brightness of each active galaxy will be made publicly available, along with their redshifts, so that anyone can mine the data to answer other astronomical questions. In this project, the investigators will analyze the overall spectral energy distribution of each active galaxy to deduce its dust and gas content. For selected subsets of data, the investigators will measure key characteristics like black hole mass, luminosity, amount of dust and gas (important for understanding whether any light is occluded), black hole growth rate, and the number of other galaxies near each active galaxy. The investigators will combine these measurements to model the growth of black holes over time, constrained by the data acquired. The investigators will also search for evidence of the interplay between black hole growth at the center of the active galaxy and star formation throughout the active galaxy; this will be most apparent in massive galaxies, like our own Milky Way. All these investigations will be published and made openly available to everyone."

The virtual numerical laboratory that will be created represents technical solutions widely applicable to many areas of scientific and educational endeavor.<br/><br/>Cosmological computer simulations with large dynamic range that model statistically representative parts of the observable universe are an essential component of the quest to understand the structure of the universe, and in particular how galaxies form, how they are distributed in space, and how environment influences their evolution.  The data sets produced by such simulations have started to exceed in size and richness the results of the largest observational surveys, straining the computational and storage resources that support the required complex algorithms.  This is especially true because much of the analysis will be performed by scientists who were not involved in the original work and may be unfamiliar with the properties of the simulation outputs.  This project will allow access to the original simulations, and simultaneously extend and complete the creation of synthetic observations that can be directly compared to telescope data.  The system will allow experts and non-experts to investigate the virtual universes created by simulations and match them to observation, by forming a virtual observatory with access to everything from raw outputs, through idealized intermediate products, to realistic model observations.  Users can investigate such aspects of gravitational collapse as scaling relations and distinct clustering patterns, and study systematic biases and information loss.  The objective is to enable everyone to perform the sort of scientific experiments on simulation data that can currently only be done by specialists.<br/><br/>The broadly usable technical solutions that will be created by this study will tie raw Petabyte size simulation output files to structured relational databases, with direct applications as diverse as turbulence and genomics.  Forward modelling to the observational domain will benefit any area where theory and simulation must be interpreted by non-specialists.  The project will establish the Johns Hopkins group as a core US partner in the European Virgo Consortium, and further establish a public simulation database effort in the US."

Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they were first detected in astronomical observations of a special kind of galaxy called an ""active galaxy""---distinguished by the fact that a very big black hole at its center is growing at a rapid rate and radiating enough light to heat the entire galaxy. From detailed measurements of that light in thousands of active galaxies, the investigators will learn when and where these black holes grew over the past 13 billion years of cosmic time. They will also connect that growth to measurements of the black hole masses at different epochs in order to form a comprehensive understanding of how and when black holes grew and how much energy was radiated into the galaxy as a result. This in turn supplies a vital ingredient to theorists' models of how galaxies like our own Milky Way formed and evolved. This project will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, learning and excellence through a collaboration with the Meyerhoff Scholars program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. <br/><br/>This proposal will identify up to 16,000 active galaxies in three surveys (called GOODS, COSMOS, and Stripe 82X), which have complementary combinations of depth (sensitivity) and area on the sky. The active galaxies will be identified by the amount of X-ray light they emit. Their distances will be measured using optical and infrared spectroscopic observations at large telescopes to determine the redshift (i.e., the wavelength shift of atomic emission or absorption lines) of a large fraction of the active galaxies. For the rest, the investigators will estimate redshifts by analyzing the total infrared, optical, and ultraviolet light that they emit. Catalogs listing the X-ray, infrared, and optical brightness of each active galaxy will be made publicly available, along with their redshifts, so that anyone can mine the data to answer other astronomical questions. In this project, the investigators will analyze the overall spectral energy distribution of each active galaxy to deduce its dust and gas content. For selected subsets of data, the investigators will measure key characteristics like black hole mass, luminosity, amount of dust and gas (important for understanding whether any light is occluded), black hole growth rate, and the number of other galaxies near each active galaxy. The investigators will combine these measurements to model the growth of black holes over time, constrained by the data acquired. The investigators will also search for evidence of the interplay between black hole growth at the center of the active galaxy and star formation throughout the active galaxy; this will be most apparent in massive galaxies, like our own Milky Way. All these investigations will be published and made openly available to everyone."

The result will be the widest area and deepest catalog yet available.  It will be ideal for comparing to other large area surveys, especially of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).  Those studies will shed light on cosmology and dark energy.  They may even show whether a more exotic theory of gravity is needed.  Education is included through special topic courses.  There are connections to national laboratories.  The methods will be introduced to students from other disciplines.<br/><br/>This project will create a combined value-added galaxy catalog to be called PS1*, for statistical studies of large-scale structure (LSS).  Building on experience developing a star-galaxy separation algorithm for the first PanSTARRS catalog (PS1) using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and training sets from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, the work will proceed by matching Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data, PS1, and where available, SDSS and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) objects.  The SVM algorithm will extend over the output catalog.  The resulting galaxy maps will be several times larger than SDSS, with less stellar contamination than PS1 alone, and will be deeper than WISE or 2MASS.  Previously demonstrated machine learning tools will then be used to estimate photometric redshifts for the combined sample.  The new PS1* will be the widest area, deepest photometric redshift catalog, and will be optimal for cross correlation studies with other wide data sets, such as the CMB, X-ray surveys, the cosmic infrared background, and maps of gravitational lensing.<br/><br/>Specific questions that will be studied include whether CMB anomalies are caused by LSS, whether superstructures that will be found in PS1* have any effect on the CMB, how the map of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to be created from PS1* relates to the CMB map from the Planck satellite, and how well LSS statistics and cosmological parameters can be extracted.  The project will explore novel machine learning techniques for both star-galaxy separation and photometric redshifts and apply state of the art statistical techniques, shedding light on cosmological parameters and dark energy.  It will investigate any connection between LSS and CMB anomalies, and whether this is consistent with ISW or requires a more exotic theory.  The catalog will be publicly available for a variety of cross-correlation studies, and the algorithms and open source software developed will be disseminated widely.  This study promotes the integration of research into teaching through courses, internships, and including cross-disciplinary students."

Such acuity cannot be obtained by either telescope alone.  This challenging technique can resolve stars outside our solar system, despite their very great distances.  Such a feat is impossible with any single telescope, for which even the closest stars are still seen as unresolved points of light.  Ordinary interferometry combines the amplitudes of optical telescope signals to form an image.  This project utilizes another kind of interferometry that makes use of the quantum nature of light (photons).  This quantum approach was first demonstrated in the 1950?s.  Kieda and collaborators update this approach by using large, well-separated optical light collectors and fast, modern electronics.  They will form images of 35 bright stars over the course of a one-year observing campaign. They will use the VERITAS Observatory and their own dedicated detectors, electronics and data connectivity.  This project will serve as a technology pathfinder that may lead to a new regime in ultra-high resolution optical astronomy.<br/><br/>This project will image stars in the UV/Optical bandpass using the method of Hanbury Brown Twiss (HBT) interferometry.  This method utilizes the correlation between intensity fluctuations, also called photon bunching, that occurs when different detectors observe the same source.  In this method, the intensity correlation time series is the interferometric quantity upon which images are derived.  The main advantage of this method is that it is robust to atmospheric turbulence; however, its low inherent sensitivity demands large-area light collectors.  It also requires fast time resolution and long integration times.   Astronomical observations using HBT were done in the 1960?s and 1970?s during which time the angular diameters of more than 30 stars were measured with a resolution of 1 mas.   This method was recently demonstrated on several bright stars with modern detectors and electronics operating in the photon-counting regime.   Kieda and collaborators will use the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory telescopes to demonstrate imaging with intensity interferometry.  They have validated key technologies for measuring spatial and temporal bunching of blackbody radiation.   They have demonstrated the ability to reconstruct images using synthetic data.  Their method requires sub-nanosecond synchronization of the data acquisition from multiple detectors spaced at ~100+ meter baselines. This project has the potential to demonstrate a scalable technology and open a wide, unexplored frontier for astronomical, optical imaging with ultra-high resolution."

A new, more precise telescopic instrument, called iSHELL, replaced the first instrument that the investigators designed and used to develop these observing methods.  In this project the investigators will develop computer programs and techniques to study the new telescopic data from iSHELL more thoroughly and accurately.

An NIR RV precision of 3 m/s will make it possible to detect 1-10 Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of M dwarf stars and to evaluate the wavelength dependence of stellar jitter from the visible to the near-infrared for main sequence and young stars.  This project builds on the successful NIR precise RV instrumentation prototyped from 2010- 2015 using the CSHELL instrument at the NASA Infra-Red Telescope Facility.  The collaboration surveyed a sample of young moving group M dwarfs and a sample of nearby M dwarfs that have not been previously monitored, identifying several candidate exoplanets.  The iSHELL replaced CSHELL with first light at IRTF in August 2016.  Owing to the improvements in spectral grasp, resolution, optics, and detector characteristics, the investigators will likely achieve a long-term precision of < 3 m/s with iSHELL.

These objects are groups of thousands to millions of stars like our sun. They are so distant that light from their stars has taken billions of years to reach us. Most galaxies this distant are visible in the deepest images from Hubble, but not all. Some galaxies contain a lot of dust, making them more difficult to see because the dust obscures starlight. Starlight heats the dust, which then re-radiates that energy at millimeter wavelengths. These dusty galaxies form stars very rapidly, and are important to our understanding of how stars form. Little is known about how common dusty galaxies were in the first few billion years after the Big Bang.

The goal of this proposal is to use all of the collective FIR through millimeter data in a newly developed backward evolution model to: (1) statistically constrain the total integrated IR galaxy luminosity function out to high-redshifts, (2) measure the AGN contribution to the total cosmic infrared background, (3) provide non-clustered predictions for submm source multiplicity, and (4) use simulations to motivate future large (sub)mm surveys for optimization at high-redshifts. This project will draw in undergraduate research scholars from under-represented backgrounds to UT Austin for the summer to conduct research on this topic through the TAURUS program.

The AGN themselves, lying at the very center of the galaxies, are explained as having a torus of gas and dust that blocks light from the inside, and can obscure the AGN central engine (the black hole). However, astronomers don't fully understand the exact properties of the torus, and directly viewing the torus with telescopes is extremely difficult. In this proposal, the PI plans to address the key questions of: (a) What material makes up the torus, and how is it connected to the rest of the gas and dust between the stars of the host galaxy? (b) How do the torus properties, such as geometry and thickness, depend on the brightness of the AGN? (c) Do the properties of the dust in the torus change with the AGN brightness? and (d) What is the role of star formation near the AGN in the centers of galaxies in feeding and/or blocking AGN?  Answers to these questions will provide insight into how the AGN is fueled by gas in the galaxy and how that might have an impact on the formation of the galaxy itself. <br/><br/>Through the PI's network of collaborators, the proposed work will aid in furthering links in astronomy in the developing nation of Mexico, and it promotes involvement of US Spanish-speaking team members, primarily Hispanics, through connections with Spain and Mexico. The PI also plans to work with local high-school teachers to enhance their understanding and teaching of astronomical topics.  In this way, he hopes to reach local school children in the San Antonio area, an area of high diversity, providing high quality scientific content, and encouraging the students (including underrepresented minorities) to pursue scientific fields. The intent is to use the interesting astronomical content as a ""gateway"" to STEM subjects.  <br/><br/><br/>Observations at mid-infrared (MIR: 7-26 microns) wavelengths are essential, as the torus intercepts a large amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted from near the black hole and re-radiates it in this waveband. MIR facilities such as the 8m Subaru telescope and the Gran Telescope Canarias (GTC) offer the possibility to probe the centers of AGN at MIR wavelengths with high spatial resolution. <br/><br/>Models assuming clumpy dust distribution in AGN are making significant progress explaining MIR emission. High-resolution observation will help constrain model parameters and provide insight into torus physical properties. This proposal would fund analysis of data from ~100 hours of guaranteed time (GT) on the GTC and an additional 180 hours of ESO-GTC time (jointly ESO and GTC allocated time, competitively awarded as part of Spain's ascension to ESO membership).  This would be combined with archival data from Gemini to tackle a key problem in AGN research.<br/> <br/>A detailed understanding of the torus, the AGN/black hole fueling process and its relationship to (or even creation of) the torus, the interaction with the host galaxy, and dust chemistry in other galaxies will be constructed. Simulations based on current data to prepare new observations for next generation facilities (such as SOFIA, JWST, TMT, etc.) are planned."

It will study (1) whether UDGs are distinct from other types of galaxies such as the Milky Way and dwarf galaxies; (2) how they are protected from the gravitational disruptions; and (3) whether they have even fainter outskirts.

The data are taken with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. These unique data will show the very faint outskirts of UDGs, as well as their large-scale environments. The program will perform the most reliable census and resolved analysis of the UDG population within, outside, and among the clusters. The main goals are (1) to confirm whether UDGs are distinct from dwarf and normal galaxies in their properties parameter spaces; (2) to constrain how they formed and how they their properties depend on their environments; and (3) to image their fainter outskirts and to discover even fainter, more extended UDGs. The project focuses primarily on UDGs, but aims to yield a broader, coherent picture that connects UDGs, dwarfs, and normal galaxies.

Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they were first detected in astronomical observations of a special kind of galaxy called an ""active galaxy""---distinguished by the fact that a very big black hole at its center is growing at a rapid rate and radiating enough light to heat the entire galaxy.  From detailed measurements of that light in thousands of active galaxies, the investigators will learn when and where these black holes grew over the past 13 billion years of cosmic time.  They will also connect that growth to measurements of the black hole masses at different epochs in order to form a comprehensive understanding of how and when black holes grew and how much energy was radiated into the galaxy as a result.  This in turn supplies a vital ingredient to theorists' models of how galaxies like our own Milky Way formed and evolved.  This project will advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, learning and excellence through a collaboration with the Meyerhoff Scholars program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. <br/><br/>This proposal will identify up to 16,000 active galaxies in three surveys (called GOODS, COSMOS, and Stripe 82X), which have complementary combinations of depth (sensitivity) and area on the sky.  The active galaxies will be identified by the amount of X-ray light they emit.  Their distances will be measured using optical and infrared spectroscopic observations at large telescopes to determine the redshift (i.e., the wavelength shift of atomic emission or absorption lines) of a large fraction of the active galaxies.  For the rest, the investigators will estimate redshifts by analyzing the total infrared, optical, and ultraviolet light that they emit.  Catalogs listing the X-ray, infrared, and optical brightness of each active galaxy will be made publicly available, along with their redshifts, so that anyone can mine the data to answer other astronomical questions.  In this project, the investigators will analyze the overall spectral energy distribution of each active galaxy to deduce its dust and gas content.  For selected subsets of data, the investigators will measure key characteristics like black hole mass, luminosity, amount of dust and gas (important for understanding whether any light is occluded), black hole growth rate, and the number of other galaxies near each active galaxy.  The investigators will combine these measurements to model the growth of black holes over time, constrained by the data acquired.  The investigators will also search for evidence of the interplay between black hole growth at the center of the active galaxy and star formation throughout the active galaxy; this will be most apparent in massive galaxies, like our own Milky Way.  All these investigations will be published and made openly available to everyone."

Its surface, which is larger than a football field, must be adjusted very precisely to bring the incoming radio waves into focus, so the surface was designed with more than 2000 individual panels mounted on precise motors.  The motors can move the panels to compensate for any deviations from the perfect shape.  While this works quite well at night, it can be very difficult to make this adjustment during daylight hours, when sunlight falling on different parts of the dish causes temperature changes and unpredictable distortions that cannot currently be measured.  These distortions limit use of the GBT at its highest operating frequencies, where tolerances on surface accuracy are the tightest.  The current project will implement a laser ranging measurement system on the GBT that will measure any surface distortions very accurately, allowing the GBT to be focused precisely both day and night.  This will increase the available usable time of the telescope at its highest operating frequencies by as much as 1,000 hours every year, with a corresponding increase in the scientific output of the GBT and its utility to the US scientific community for a broad range of investigations. The Green Bank Observatory also supports a wide range of public outreach activities through its visitor center.  <br/><br/>Enhancements to the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) metrology system are planned that will enable expanded operation in the 3mm wavelength band during daylight hours.

Recent technological advances in commercial metrology make it possible to purchase a Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) which, when mounted near the prime focus of the GBT, can scan the entire dish in one to two minutes, producing ~10 million data points with individual range accuracies of the order of a few mm. A least-squares fit to these data provides an estimate of the surface with accuracies ~30 microns rms, significantly better than the current method of ""out-of-focus holography"" and well in excess of the accuracy needed. The measured surface would be compared to the ideal surface to produce commands to the surface panel actuators to compensate for the thermal distortions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To study this contradiction, the investigators will use radio and optical telescopes to observe Neptune at the same time. They aim to understand the cloud formation and motions of gases, in order to understand the composition of Neptune's atmosphere at many different depths, the circulation of the atmosphere across the whole planet, storms, and unusual but local changes across all of Neptune. Students and amateur astronomers will also work on this project. This research serves the national interest by detailing the structure and composition of Neptune, one of four gas giant planets in the Solar System, and similar to many planets discovered around other stars. The investigators also regularly give talks to the public about their research, and will present the story of Neptune and how it relates to planet formation in general.  <br/><br/><br/>A global circulation model of the planet Neptune has been derived, with gas rising at mid-latitudes and descending over the equator and the south pole. This circulation model extends from the stratosphere (<0.1 mbar pressure levels) down to tens of bars into the deep troposphere. Many puzzles remain, however, such as the presence of clouds in regions of subsiding air (e.g., South pole, equator), and a relatively low radio opacity at mid-southern latitudes contrary to expectations of rising air. The principal investigators will use the combination of Very Large Array (1-13 cm), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (1-3 mm), Hubble Space Telescope (visible) and W. M.

Maps of the planet will be produced at different frequencies resolved in both latitude and longitude using the upgraded VLA. Simultaneously-obtained images in the visible (HST) and NIR (adaptive optics on Keck) will characterize clouds and storms.

An important, basic step is to measure how strongly dark-matter particles interact with each other, independent of gravity. When physicists want to investigate the basic properties of sub-atomic particles, they smash them together in expensive man-made colliders. Fortunately, Nature has provided dark-matter colliders, for free, in the form of merging clusters of galaxies.

Cluster membership data are used to age-date the collision. Given this information, simulations can be used to constrain how strongly the dark-matter particles need to interact with each other (the ""self-interaction cross-section"") to reproduce the snapshot of the collision. This technique becomes stronger if an ensemble of merging clusters is studied, instead of only one. The proposal will apply the technique to an ensemble of merging clusters. Moreover, the proposal also takes the novel step of requiring that the mergers exhibit radio relics. This requirement is important because it provides extra, independent information about the merger ages and also ensures the plane-of-sky viewing angles that will maximize the effects being sought."

However, stronger signals from interstellar clouds and magnetic fields in our Milky Way Galaxy prevent scientists from measuring that faint signal.  The space between the stars contains many such clouds of gas and dust.  Dramatic astronomical images reveal them - for example, the Great Nebula in the constellation Orion or the famous Eagle Nebula.  Dust grains in the interstellar clouds also polarize reflected starlight weakly.  Astronomers can measure this weak polarization in order to find the interstellar clouds.  In this project, the Investigators will construct a novel instrument to measure the optical polarization produced by interstellar dust clouds.  Using these measurements with spacecraft data, they will map the locations of Galactic clouds and magnetic fields. Scientists can then separate their signals from the cosmic microwave background radiation. This project serves the national interest by increasing our knowledge of the early Universe. The Investigators will involve an international team of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in all aspects of this project, giving it strong Broader Impacts.<br/><br/>The Investigators will design and build a novel wide-area linear optical polarimeter (WALOP) and will use the instrument to measure polarization caused by interstellar dust and to map the distribution of dust in the Milky Way Galaxy.  With a 30 x 30 arcminute field of view, the polarimeter will form four simultaneous images of each star, enabling determinations of the magnitude, fractional polarization, and polarization angle for each object.  It will be deployed on a 1-meter telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO).  Combined with distance measurements from the GAIA spacecraft, the polarization data will enable 3D tomography of the interstellar medium, providing information that may enable scientists to extract the very weak polarization signal expected from the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  The Intellectual Merit of the work derives primarily from the fact that improved mapping of the dust distribution in the Galaxy may enable astronomers to detect a predicted weak polarization signal (the so-called ""B-mode"" signal) in CMB radiation, significantly improving cosmologists' understanding of the very early Universe.   The observations also will improve astronomers'understanding of dust formation, evolution, composition, and alignment by magnetic fields in the Galaxy. The investigators plan strong programs aimed at undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs at Caltech, at IUCAA in India, at the SAAO, and at the University of Crete in Greece, combining instrument development with cutting-edge astrophysics and cosmology programs and including reciprocal visits among the partner institutions."

This project will focus on studying the only type of supernovae known to be associated with GRBs, which are called type BL Ic. The PI and her team will combine observations of these objects at the Palomar Transient Factory with follow-up radio emission measurements done at the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to search for GRB signatures.  Using new capabilities of the VLA brought about by the recent upgrade.  They also plan to conduct gravitational wave measurements with Advanced LIGO.

These stars shine because of nuclear reactions in their cores.  This process also has made most of the oxygen and carbon atoms that exist today.  When these massive stars die, lighter elements are turned into heavier ones, such as iron.  We are literally made up of this 'star stuff'.  These stars also give off so much energy that they cause new stars to form.    Although we understand most kinds of stars pretty well, there are many things about massive stars that remain a mystery.  The goal of this project is to see how well our theories work by comparing predictions against observations.  This project will give us a clearer picture of what happens as a massive star ages.  The investigators will compare the type of stars found in different nearby galaxies, using data taken on large telescopes in Arizona and in Chile.   This project will also fund two early-career research students, and provide research projects for two undergraduates.<br/><br/>The investigators will study massive stars in several ways. They plan to observe Local Group galaxies, which are close enough to be studied in great detail. They will observe all massive stars in these galaxies. Specifically they will determine 1) how changing orbits of binary stars modify the element formation in massive stars and 2) how the most massive stars end their lives. <br/><br/>The investigator and his collaborators have begun a survey for Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Magellanic Clouds. With half of the area covered, the project has already confirmed the existence of 15 new WR stars, 10 of which appear to be a new type, never before seen. These discoveries suggest that the population of WR stars in the Magellanic Clouds may have been underestimated by as much as 40%, and yet for decades the Magellanic Clouds have served as the linchpins for evaluating massive star models at low metallicities. When complete, the Magellanic Cloud WR Survey will permit the determination of what fraction of WR stars have changed through binary interactions (Roche-lobe overflow) and fraction show changes in element abundance through single-star material losses due to stellar winds. Thirty WR binaries have been identified in M31 and M33, and repeated radial velocity measurements are being made with the 6.5-m MMT telescope, along with photometric monitoring at Lowell Observatory?s new 4.3-m telescope. This project will provide similar data on the frequency of binary interactions at higher metallicity, and provide direct measurements of the masses of WR stars for comparison with model predictions. The nature of the mysterious, oxygen-rich, WR stars (WO stars) will be explored by determining accurate surface abundances of carbon and oxygen. Comparing these observations to models will determine if the WO stars are truly the ""last hurrah"" of the most massive stars.  Each of these experiments provides a key piece of information to improve models of massive star nuclear energy production. <br/><br/>The investigator will bring undergraduates into his research program, providing a boost to students from small, liberal arts colleges.  This experience enables their students to successfully compete for entrance to best graduate schools in the country. These students are drawn from the REU program administered through Northern Arizona University, as well as Lowell Observatory's MIT Field Camp, which now includes students from the all-women?s Wellesley College."

Different types of waves will be introduced as forces at this base atmospheric level to see how they drive the circulation in the atmosphere.

Fulfilling all three elements for more than a handful of objects is possible only now through the confluence of two new large surveys: the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) IV's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) project for spatially resolved properties of 10,000 galaxies and the Tata Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Sky Survey (TGSS) to provide low frequency radio data covering the entire MaNGA survey region that will reveal past radio AGN activity. By combining data from these surveys and adding state-of-the-art simulations of the radio AGN, we will be able to place statistical constraints on the time histories of galaxies and their AGN. Specifically, the PIs will investigate the following overarching questions: (1) Do the star formation histories of galaxies, and their AGN activity histories, suggest they are connected and change together over time? (2) Do the spatially resolved galaxy properties show signs of AGN feedback leading to the stopping of star formation in the galaxies?"

Scientists now see Neptune as having an atmosphere with gases that sink at Neptune's equator and south pole, and rise at its mid-latitudes. But scientists have also seen clouds where air was expected to be sinking, and thinner atmosphere where air was expected to be rising. To study this contradiction, the investigators will use radio and optical telescopes to observe Neptune at the same time. They aim to understand the cloud formation and motions of gases, in order to understand the composition of Neptune's atmosphere at many different depths, the circulation of the atmosphere across the whole planet, storms, and unusual but local changes across all of Neptune. Students and amateur astronomers will also work on this project. This research serves the national interest by detailing the structure and composition of Neptune, one of four gas giant planets in the Solar System, and similar to many planets discovered around other stars. The investigators also regularly give talks to the public about their research, and will present the story of Neptune and how it relates to planet formation in general.  <br/><br/><br/>A global circulation model of the planet Neptune has been derived, with gas rising at mid-latitudes and descending over the equator and the south pole. This circulation model extends from the stratosphere (<0.1 mbar pressure levels) down to tens of bars into the deep troposphere. Many puzzles remain, however, such as the presence of clouds in regions of subsiding air (e.g., South pole, equator), and a relatively low radio opacity at mid-southern latitudes contrary to expectations of rising air. The principal investigators will use the combination of Very Large Array (1-13 cm), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (1-3 mm), Hubble Space Telescope (visible) and W. M. Keck Observatory (NIR) telescopes to observe Neptune often simultaneously to couple cloud formation to gas dynamics and condensation. These data are critical for understanding the composition of the deep atmosphere, the global circulation pattern, localized storm systems and turbulent motions in Neptune's atmosphere. The combined datasets cover Neptune's entire altitude range from the stratosphere down to ~100 bar. Maps of the planet will be produced at different frequencies resolved in both latitude and longitude using the upgraded VLA. Simultaneously-obtained images in the visible (HST) and NIR (adaptive optics on Keck) will characterize clouds and storms. ALMA data at continuum wavelengths and in the spectral windows of several disequilibrium species (e.g., CO, HCN, PH3) will be obtained. Students and the amateur astronomy community will contribute to this research. The investigators also regularly give talks to the public about their research, and will present the story of Neptune and how it relates to planet formation in general."

The amount of light that is cut coupled with the amount of time during these passages tells us about the size, shape, whether the object has an atmosphere, and how thick the atmosphere might be. These events are called occultations. This project will observe occultations of stars by the Trans-Neptunian Objects Pluto, Triton, Makemake, Quaoar, and Salacia. Since 1988, Pluto's atmosphere has been tracked by occultations. Its atmosphere has gotten thicker during this time. It is now expected to get thinner as Pluto moves farther away from the Sun in its orbit, and its temperature gets cooler. Two occultations by Pluto will be observed over the next three years to record changes in the thickness of Pluto's atmosphere. These changes will be modeled with data that we already have to describe how Pluto's atmosphere changes.

Pluto's atmosphere has been monitored by occultations since its discovery in 1988. It has been doubling in size roughly every ten years, despite the fact that Pluto itself has move farther from the Sun in its orbit. Images of Pluto's surface from the New Horizons spacecraft show large ice reservoirs that are the source of Pluto's atmosphere. These reservoirs have been getting slightly warmer as Pluto has moved away from the Sun, suggesting that Pluto's subsurface stores heat. Models predict, however, that Pluto's frost temperatures will soon start to fall.

The burst lasts a fraction of a second. Yet modern radio telescopes like the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia can detect these remarkable events - if they are equipped with sensitive equipment and sophisticated computer programs to analyze the data. A collaboration of scientists and students (both graduate and undergraduate) from the University of West Virginia and Virginia Tech plan to develop these programs for the GBT. Astronomers do not yet know what produces FRBs. They could be the result of colliding stars, or perhaps black holes swallowing neighboring stars. Either way, telescopes like the GBT should lead astronomers much closer to an answer.<br/><br/>The detection of FRBs, believed to be extra-galactic in origin, and other potentially exotic radio transits, has in recent years been enabled by a revolution in radio instrumentation and computing power. The latter has lead to the development of sophisticated signal processing algorithms. The principal investigator, working with her graduate and undergraduate students and a collaborator at Virginia Tech., aims to develop such algorithms with a view to deploying them on the GBT and detecting radio transients in real time. The techniques will be prototyped on radio receivers already in place and in operation at the GBT; the software will run in parallel with existing data processing systems. The algorithms will enable sensitive, wide-field surveys of pulsars and other radio transients, in additions to the FRBs mentioned above. The algorithms and source code will be made freely available to the astronomical community once commissioned on the GBT. The PI also aims to develop a ""Statistical Signal Processing for Sensor Arrays"" undergraduate course to help make the technology more accessible to a wider audience and to educate the next generation of scientists and engineers."

This is now seen as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.  As the universe expanded, it cooled. At later stages, the first stars formed. These caused the neutral material to be ionized again, in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At later times, the limit is set by the ionization caused by the first stars.  After the first stars, the first galaxies formed. This is a theoretical scenario, so measurements are needed to provide important details needed.  The goal of this project is the first measurement of neutral hydrogen from the EoR. Such a measurement is extremely difficult because of instrumental effects. In addition, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. The hands-on training provides a unique introduction to ultra-precise measurements, so this will be an unequaled experience involving instrumentation and data analysis. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is the measurement of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. The history of the universe is traced by redshifts, so higher redshifts correspond to earlier times. The CMB arose at a redshift of about 1000. At redshifts of about 30, the most abundant constituent is neutral atomic hydrogen. The highest measured redshift for a galaxy is about 8. Presumably, at redshifts higher than 8, this material was reionized by stars, during the Epoch of Recombination (EoR). Thus the EoR should be bounded by redshifts 8 and 30. At earlier times the limit to the EoR is set by the recombination of ions caused by the CMB. The EoR allows a look back to a time before the first stars and galaxies formed. Depending on the local physical conditions, the spectral line can be either in absorption against the CMB or in emission. Though a measurement of this line, the state of the universe during the EoR can be determined in more detail. This complements the extensive, ongoing studies of the CMB. The proposers will lower the instrumental effects caused by the large linewidth and the high intensity of foreground radiation. They will accomplish this by constructing an improved receiver with a more uniform response over the range of redshifts studied. In addition they will investigate a dipole design that has a more uniform response. These advances are at the forefront of electronics design, and so require a large number of laboratory tests, each of which is very time-consuming. In addition, the proposers are improving their data reductions to further reduce the effect of systematic errors. The detection of the EoR spectrum will serve to expand our knowledge of the evolution of the universe in a very significant, perhaps transformational, fashion. This will provide an important link between the early stages of the universe, before stars formed, and the present stage. The training of students in the techniques of ultra-precise measurements is unique. The interaction with commercial firms may have wide-ranging implications for the design of much improved test equipment."

In the present day the matter is very strongly clustered into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and even larger structures. This evolution is governed by gravity and by additional processes such as formation of stars in galaxies. There is enormous amount of information about the universe origins, content, and future evolution hidden in the galaxy distribution.  This information is difficult to access in the present-day form because it has been scrambled by gravity and other processes. The goal of this project is to use simulations to reconstruct the initial conditions of our universe. When these are evolved in time with known laws of physics, they give rise to our visible universe. Ultimately this will allow a movie to made of our universe starting from the initial smooth distribution and ending in images of actual galaxies such as the Hubble Deep Field. A major benefit of this method is that information about our universe can be simply extracted from the initial conditions.  More broadly, an aim of this project is to impact other communities where similar problems arise such as machine learning via the methods and tools developed   <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and apply a new set of theoretical and computational instruments, including new statistical methods, algorithms, and computational implementations, to optimally reconstruct the initial condition of our universe from the spatial distribution of galaxies. Galaxies are a primary probe of the large scale structure of the universe that are or will be observed by surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), EUCLID and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). This project will extend a hierarchical probabilistic generative model developed by the PI's team to the modelling of galaxies. The framework attempts to solve an exact probabilistic model for the initial conditions that is conditioned on the data with a process that combines elements of numerical optimization in high dimensions and analytic marginalization to find the best solution and their covariance matrix. The proposed research will apply this method to galaxy redshift catalogs and their surrounding dark matter information inferred from weak lensing. The method will be developed using realistic simulations of both dark matter and of galaxies populated in the dark matter and hydro simulations, before being applied to real data.  This research will explore best methods to achieve fast convergence in the search for local and global minimum and aims to have an impact more broadly to research areas (e.g. neural networks) outside astronomy in the tools developed for non-convex optimization in very high dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thyagarajan and collaborators will demonstrate it on real data.  They will use the Long Wavelength Array in La Sevilleta, New Mexico.  They will encode this algorithm in specialized hardware to enable a survey of astronomical radio transients. In addition to benefitting astronomy, this algorithm may find application wherever interferometry is used.  Applications include radar, acoustic interferometry used in oceanography, national security applications and medicine.<br/><br/>Coming advances in radio astronomy will be enabled by extremely large interferometers driven by high-performance, low-cost digital signal processing.

If we know how bright a star should look, we can compare its apparent brightness to find its distance.  Unfortunately, these stars are rare and thus poorly understood at the moment.  The investigator plans to collect basic data about massive, luminous stars in other galaxies.  The observations will help us better understand the lives of these stars.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will take part in the research.  She will also work with the Zooniverse Project to convert the light variations of astronomical objects---usually conveyed visually---to sound.  This effort will be of interest to citizen scientists, particularly those who are visually impaired.<br/><br/>The investigator describes a multi-wavelength observing plan that covers the post-main sequence phases of stellar evolution before the stars explode as supernovae.  The ongoing HST COS far-UV SNAP program provides high S/N spectra, with better resolution, than were previously possible.  The project will sample objects of different metallicity, including extremely-metal-poor galaxies, that will serve as analogs for star formation regions in the early Universe.  The investigator will also create a comprehensive library of ultraviolet spectra using observations of 87 nearby star-forming galaxies, using these data to test the next generation of stellar population synthesis and photoionization codes."

Under the influence of gravity alone, all this gas should have collapsed into stars.  However, most of the matter in the Universe is not in stars; it is diffuse gas.  Furthermore, galaxies rarely show gas falling in; it is almost always flowing out.  Study of diffuse gas around galaxies is needed to understand how some small fraction of this tenuous vapor finally gave rise to the universe we know today.  In this project, Rubin and collaborators take advantage of new observations of hundreds of galaxies that reveal nearby gas.  Their specialized methods are sensitive to cool gas, which is relatively massive and dense.  They can image its position and determine its velocity relative to each galaxy.

The black hole may have a mass of millions to billions times that of the sun.  As this picture implies, the quasar phenomenon is one and the same as that of the objects referred to as ""active galactic nuclei."" All are characterized by enormous luminosity such that the quasar frequently outshines the light from all of the billions of stars in its host galaxy.  The existence of black holes has captivated people of all levels of scientific sophistication.  The study of active galactic nuclei as well as the nucleus of our own galaxy has produced strong evidence that, indeed, supermassive black holes do exist and that they are the engines at the heart of the quasar phenomenon.  This project aims to continue the estimate of the mass of the supermassive black holes in a sample of objects and extend it to objects of higher luminosity than those previously studied via a combination of an intense observational program as well as development of new analysis techniques.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will establish the state of the art in reverberation mapping of active galaxies and quasars.  Reverberation mapping is a technique where one looks at the reaction of the emission line spectrum of the active object to see how it responds to a change in the intensity of the continuum source that ionizes and excites the surrounding line-emitting gas.  It is a technique that has been employed over the last few decades to measure the size and structure of the so-called broad line region in active galactic nuclei, and, in the past five years, the technique has been applied to high-cadence observations to provide the best constraints on the mass of the accreting black hole at the heart of the active object.  This project will further advance the technique via a three-phase effort: (1) analysis of data from a high-cadence optical/ultraviolet monitoring campaign for NGC 5548 that will represent the single most intensive reverberation mapping program ever attempted; (2) execution of a one year duration reverberation mapping campaign at Lick Observatory to probe broad-line region structure at luminosities an order of magnitude higher than the luminosities probed by other recent dedicated monitoring programs; and (3) new development of state-of-the-art software for modeling reverberation mapping data. The combination of these projects will make it possible to dissect the structural and dynamical properties of the broad-line region in greater detail than ever before, enabling critical new tests of the local calibration for the quasar black hole mass scale."

This is now seen as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.  As the universe expanded, it cooled. At later stages, the first stars formed. These caused the neutral material to be ionized again, in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At later times, the limit is set by the ionization caused by the first stars.  After the first stars, the first galaxies formed. This is a theoretical scenario, so measurements are needed to provide important details needed.  The goal of this project is the first measurement of neutral hydrogen from the EoR. Such a measurement is extremely difficult because of instrumental effects. In addition, this project includes the mentoring of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students. The hands-on training provides a unique introduction to ultra-precise measurements, so this will be an unequaled experience involving instrumentation and data analysis. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is the measurement of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. The history of the universe is traced by redshifts, so higher redshifts correspond to earlier times. The CMB arose at a redshift of about 1000. At redshifts of about 30, the most abundant constituent is neutral atomic hydrogen. The highest measured redshift for a galaxy is about 8. Presumably, at redshifts higher than 8, this material was reionized by stars, during the Epoch of Recombination (EoR). Thus the EoR should be bounded by redshifts 8 and 30. At earlier times the limit to the EoR is set by the recombination of ions caused by the CMB. The EoR allows a look back to a time before the first stars and galaxies formed. Depending on the local physical conditions, the spectral line can be either in absorption against the CMB or in emission. Though a measurement of this line, the state of the universe during the EoR can be determined in more detail. This complements the extensive, ongoing studies of the CMB. The proposers will lower the instrumental effects cause by the large linewidth and the high intensity of foreground radiation. They will accomplish this by constructing an improved receiver with a more uniform response over the range of redshifts studied. In addition they will investigate a dipole design that has a more uniform response. These advances are at the forefront of electronics design, and so require a large number of laboratory tests, each of which is very time-consuming. In addition, the proposers are improving their data reductions to further reduce the effect of systematic errors. The detection of the EoR spectrum will serve to expand our knowledge of the evolution of the universe in a very significant, perhaps transformational, fashion. This will provide an important link between the early stages of the universe, before stars formed, and the present stage. The training of students in the techniques of ultra-precise measurements is unique. The interaction with commercial firms may have wide-ranging implications for the design of much improved test equipment."

In particular, the PI will (1) create a ranger talk on nearby galaxies and their nuclei to be used by staff at Bryce, (2) create an astronomy outreach training program for rangers at other parks nationwide so they can replicate Bryce's success, and (3) develop a summer internship program for undergraduate astronomy students. <br/><br/>This work will provide critical contributions to our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes, as well as the incredibly dense stellar clusters that lie at the centers of galaxies. It will leverage data from numerous federally funded astronomy facilities, and link with computational simulations of the evolution of the universe. Furthermore, the PI's outreach program will extend beyond Utah and Bryce Canyon to inspire national park visitors across the country to learn about the night sky."

The Sun is also the primary driver for the space weather that impacts human life on Earth.  Since 1976, the National Solar Observatory (NSO) has operated the Sacramento Peak Observatory located in Sunspot, New Mexico for the NSF as a premier solar research facility available to scientists in the U.S. and abroad.  The primary research facility still in operation at the observatory is the Richard B. Dunn Solar Telescope (DST).  The DST can study the Sun at high resolution in wavelengths ranging from the optical to the infrared.  The NSF and the NSO are currently building the most powerful solar telescope in the world, the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) atop Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii.  While DKIST will render the DST redundant as a national user facility, the DST retains substantial value both as a scientific tool and as a training ground for the next generation of solar researchers.  This award supports science and operations of the DST as it transitions from the NSO to a potential university-based consortium led by New Mexico State University (NMSU).  During this transition, the proposers will begin an innovative science program of long-term, synoptic observations of solar magnetic fields while preparing the facility for consortium operations.   <br/><br/>This award supports science and operations of the DST for a period of 24 months bridging the gap between the departure of the NSO at the end of 2017 and the development of the NMSU-led Sunspot Solar Observatory Consortium (SSOC) as the primary operator beyond 2018.  The development of the SSOC will depend on maintaining the telescope and its instrument suite, transferring critical knowledge, and reducing areas of identified risks.  As the SSOC develops, its members will be provided with dedicated DST time in accordance with the member?s level of participation.  During the bridge period covered by this proposal, the PIs will conduct a program of synoptic science concentrating on four key areas of interest: (1) solar filament magnetic field structure, (2) solar flare energy budgets, (3) quiet Sun magnetic canopy, and (4) solar prominence instabilities.  In order to deliver the proposed synoptic science, specific knowledge of the facility will be transferred during the transition period overlapping the final year of NSO at Sunspot and the first year of SSOC operations.  The proposers highlight three important objectives to be accomplished during the transition period: (1) Complete a critical synoptic science plan for the DST; (2) Hire consortium personnel for telescope and site knowledge transfer; and (3) Update and upgrade the telescope.  In accomplishing these objectives through this award, the PIs aim to achieve the long-term goal of reinventing and reinvigorating the DST and the Sunspot facility."

These models are used across a wide range of astrophysical disciplines, and they are particularly important for characterizing the tremendous number of exoplanets that astronomers are discovering.  Accurate models of stars are needed to evaluate the habitability of Earth mass planets, and the results from this program will be particularly timely as the next generation of exoplanet searches begins explicitly targeting low-mass stars.

These measurements are achieved through the combination of ultra-precise photometry from NASA's Kepler observatory and extensive high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy from near-infrared and visible wavelength spectrographs (APOGEE, HYDRA, HRS) that have been collected by the team.  Data are analyzed with cutting-edge algorithms for light-curve modelling (PHOEBE), multi-dimensional radial velocity measurements (TODCOR/TRICOR), and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for assessing robust and repeatable parameters and parameter uncertainties.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies and how these black holes interact with their host galaxies.  Observational evidence suggests that black holes and galaxies evolve together.  This evidence includes the tightness of the correlation between the black hole mass and galaxy bulge properties and the similar history of black hole growth and star formation.  This evidence is supported by theoretical arguments.  Black holes in their active phase emit more than enough energy to unbind the host galaxies' bulge, and in their non-active phase should be present in the centers of most present-day galaxies.  As a consequence, many models for galaxy formation include a unspecified process by which a fraction of the energy released in the region surrounding the black hole contributes to the galaxy formation environment.  This interaction is generically known as ""feedback,"" and the mechanism by which the black hole acts on the host galaxy remains a mystery.  This project uses a novel spectral synthesis and statistical approach to build the tools needed to constrain the key parameter characterizing one type of feedback.<br/><br/>In addition, the project activities will directly contribute to the training of young scientists, including undergraduate students, in techniques of spectral and statistical analysis.  The PI will develop and teach a course, directed toward advanced undergraduate and graduate students, on machine learning and statistical methods, some of which will be used in this project.  The PI will bring the results of this research to the citizens of Oklahoma through participation in the OU speakers program.<br/><br/>This research effort will constrain the key parameter characterizing quasar mode feedback: the ratio of the kinetic luminosity to bolometric luminosity, in the SDSS broad absorption line quasars as a whole.

These include the location and nature of feedback interactions, a search for and evaluation of absorption-line spectral diagnostics, and constraints of key outflow physical parameters, including column density, ionization parameter, and covering fraction.<br/><br/>This research project will yield insights into the physics of quasar outflows, and measurements of key parameters that will be valuable to a wide variety of researchers.  These include scientists who are interested in on-going interactions potentially occurring in infrared-loud quasars, data analysts who use spectral diagnostics to infer physical conditions from spectra of individual objects, and theorists who need observational constraints to develop their hydromagnetic wind models, as well as providing an assessment of the viability of quasar-mode feedback for galaxy evolution models."

Thus, understanding the properties of a galaxy's cold gas component will tell us both how the star formation process changes over time and how this affects galaxies. Using a recently completed survey of carbon monoxide gas in a sample of nearby galaxies, the proposers will (1) measure how the molecular gas is used up, in order to test how star formation in the galaxies is affected; (2) map the locations of this gas in the galaxies to determine if/how these locations affect star formation; and (3) measure how the gas is flowing into and out of the galaxies to determine how this affects structural changes in the galaxies over time.  In particular, some questions that can be answered from this research include:  What factors affect the conversion of molecular gas into stars? How is molecular gas structured? How do galaxies grow and age?  This proposal will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and our understanding of these objects.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal plans to combine spatially resolved spectroscopy of carbon monoxide molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations for a sample of 125 nearby galaxies. Measuring spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion time scales as a function of various galaxy properties, using diagnostics of spectral lines to probe diffuse molecular gas, and constraining the rates of gas in- and outflow for these galaxies has the potential to add greatly to our understanding of star formation in normal galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies across a range of redshifts allow us to witness the growth and aging of the galaxy population. It has long been recognized that these processes are driven by the rise and fall of star formation, which is ultimately linked to the supply of cold gas. Further progress in understanding the regulation of star formation in galaxies, however, requires additional observational constraints beyond the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By exploiting a unique combination of the largest, most homogeneous interferometric CO survey of galaxies to date (the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution, or EDGE) and one of the principal ongoing optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys (CALIFA), the project team will confront models of star formation and galaxy evolution with uniform, high quality measurements of gas masses and star formation rates, supplemented by a vast array of additional data, including star formation history, stellar mass, nuclear activity, and the metallicity and kinematics of the gas and stars. These studies will be conducted on a spatially resolved basis across a well-defined sample that is representative of the nearby Universe, and will thus inform future studies of star formation and mass assembly at all redshifts undertaken by JWST and ALMA."

LLAMAS will be available to the US astronomical community through an open-access agreement, and will advance studies of explosive astrophysical transients, and the formation and clustering of galaxies. In addition to building LLAMAS, the MIT-based instrument team is partnering with the FabLab maker space of the Somerville, MA Public High School.

Some asteroids have been observed with telescopes to show dust-loss activity normally seen only with comets.  These are called ""active asteroids"", as they have orbits and surface characteristics of asteroids. This grant will study whether an asteroid spinning around its axis disrupts dust or particles on its surface, which are then shed off the surface of the asteroid in a landslide, creating the comet-like activity that is observed. If this process is happening, it is linked to the types of materials in the dust layer on the surface of the asteroid. The investigators will study how and why this is happening, using experiments and comparing the results with telescopic observations.  This project supports the mission of the NSF by promoting our understanding of the composition and structure of primitive materials used to create the early planets in our Solar System.  The lead investigator will recruit and guide undergraduate students for experiment design, manufacturing, operation, and data analysis in the Center for Microgravity Research laboratory, exposing them to hands-on space-related activities.<br/><br/>The active asteroids are classified as asteroids because their dynamical and spectral characteristics clearly tie them to asteroid taxonomy classes, yet they display activity in the form of particle loss at rates ranging from 10^-2 to 10^-4 kg/s. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that mass shedding on small asteroids can occur due to landslides, a process intimately linked to the material and mechanical properties of regolith (the asteroid's surface dust layer).

With the onset of advanced gravitational wave detectors, only recently have astronomers begun to place direct constraints on these processes. Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), which are detected at cosmological distances, also offer a unique and independent window into the dynamic and colorful lives of compact object mergers. A research group at Northwestern University, under the direction of the principal investigator (PI), will capitalize on complementary streams of data from gravitational wave observatories, ground-based telescopes and space-based gamma-ray and X-ray missions to: (i) develop informed follow-up strategies for electromagnetic (EM) observations following gravitational wave events, (ii) confront theoretical models of heavy element production in mergers with optical and near-infrared observations, (iii) place constraints on the fraction of mergers that produce SGRBs with radio through X-ray observations, and (iv) decipher the histories of the pre-merger binary systems with a complete census of their host galaxies.  To make this research publicly accessible in a novel way, the PI will partner with Evanston (Illinois) Township High School (ETHS) which has an on-campus planetarium. The PI will use the planetarium as a venue for engaging students with research material and exposing students to Astronomy researchers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The research group will utilize the inferred properties of previous SGRBs to build light curve prediction tools that will optimize an observatory's chance of an EM counterpart detection following a gravitational wave event. These adaptable tools will serve as an important community resource, not only for determining current observing strategies but also for planning future EM surveys. The research group will also place direct, observational constraints on the role of mergers in populating the Universe with heavy elements, by determining independently-measured ejecta masses and event rates.  The researchers will build a complete census of SGRB host galaxies and the spatial offsets of bursts from the galaxy centers.  From these observations, the researchers will determine the distributions of merger kick velocities and delay times. These distributions are vital inputs for binary evolution models, yet they are highly uncertain. The project is well-designed to exploit both methods of merger discovery: gravitational wave emission from Advanced LIGO/Virgo and gamma-ray burst detection from space-based missions.  For all objectives in this proposal, the research group will make crucial connections between the local population of compact object mergers discovered by Advanced LIGO/Virgo and their cosmological analogues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First, the orbital characteristics of about a half-dozen of the most distant KBOs are very similar.  Second, the orbits of these KBOs are spaced in location so that they appear to be influenced by the presence of a much larger body.  This research will combine both theoretical, orbital dynamics studies of these highly-irregular orbital characteristics with orbit fitting and uncertainty estimation of the telescopic data on these KBOs.  The results will lead to a much better assessment of the evidence for Planet 9, and narrow the present location of Planet 9 in the sky.

The orbit-fitting will improve knowledge of the orbital parameters of the most distant known KBOs, and will also allow for higher fidelity estimates of proximity (or lack thereof) to orbital resonances with Neptune and/or Planet 9. The observational bias analysis is important to assess the statistical significance of the apparent orbital clustering of the distant KBOs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One interesting class of stars, known as Be stars, rotate so rapidly that they somehow shed material that then forms in a disk around their equators.  In order to better understand how these disks are formed and why they occasionally seem to disappear, researchers at the University of Oklahoma, Lowell Observatory, and the University of Toledo have formed a team to carry out an intensive study of these systems.

The ionization structure in optically thin environments is governed by photoionization and recombination. The physical processes underlying spectral line formation are electron impact excitation (EIE) or electron-ion recombination (RC), and radiative decay rates. A perplexing discrepancy in abundances, of up to an order of magnitude of more, is found between those derived from emission lines excited due to EIE and those from electron-ion recombination lines of the same atomic species. This not only calls into question the basic physics of photoionization and recombination, but also the interpretation of the physical structure and distribution of elements within gaseous nebulae. This project will examine the former in order to address the latter. Specifically, calculations will be  based on: i) the unified theory of electron-ion recombination that subsumes radiative and dielectronic recombination processes, and provides a self-consistent set of atomic data for photoionization, recombination and excitation processes, (ii) recent extensions in the state-of-the-art R-matrix method including relativistic effects not heretofore considered, and (iii) pilot calculations for photoionization and recombination demonstrating the role of low-energy resonances that may be crucial to resolving the abundance(s) anomaly problem. The project will involve large-scale and high-accuracy calculations of the critical atomic parameters for a number of elements. High precision is imperative since astrophysical models need to rule out atomic physics as any significant source of uncertainty. The focus will be on some of the most prominent elements in low ionization stages: carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon and sulfur. The project will result in extensive and self-consistent sets of high-accuracy radiative and collisional atomic parameters.<br/><br/>Through analysis of their optical and infrared spectra, astronomers attempt to understand the abundances of the elements in diffuse insterstellar clouds or ""nebulae"" in which hydrogen is ionized.  They do this by measuring the strengths of the characteristic emission from ions of different elements and use these to determine the physical properties within the nebula including the abundances of the constituent elements.  These emission lines can be excited via several processes and there is a long standing discrepancy between the abundances measured using spectral lines excited by collisions versus those due to electron capture.  This project aims to remove one level of uncertainty by calculating the theoretical values for the atomic parameters that relate the excitation to the strengths of the emission.  The results of this research will be applicable across a number of sub-fields within astrophysics ranging from studies of our own galaxy to abundances in the most distant quasars."

Many outstanding problems in star formation, including the origin of star masses and the rate of star formation, rely on first, accurately determining how much molecular gas there is and, second, how energetic that gas is. However, there is no single perfect tracer for all gas densities and temperatures. The most abundant molecule within molecular clouds, molecular hydrogen (H2), is virtually invisible. Consequently, obtaining fundamental information requires understanding the relation between H2 and the emission of other less abundant species, which are all complex functions of the local environment. This research will provide a basis for understanding chemical distributions in different star-forming environments and will focus on the relationship between H2 and easily observable molecules, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN).<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to investigate the evolution of chemical abundances and line emission in star-forming molecular clouds as a function of star formation activity. The investigator will perform numerical simulations of turbulent, star-forming clouds that include magneto-hydrodynamics, radiative transfer, gravity and feedback from stars. This project will use full chemical networks coupled with multi-physics molecular cloud simulations to study the relationship between observations and underlying physical quantities. The investigator will quantitatively explore three fundamental questions: How does the relation between atomic carbon, CO, and HCN emission and H2 density evolve as a function of star formation activity? How well do tracers, such as CO and HCN, probe the gas energetics and correlate with total star formation? What is the impact of kinematic feedback due to proto-stellar outflows on astrochemistry? <br/><br/>This work has implications for estimating the total molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency, and the correspondence between molecular cloud properties (temperature, mass, velocity dispersion) and the star formation rate. They plan to archive and share the abundance and emission maps with the astronomy community through the website ""Dataverse"". This will allow comparison with observations, including Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data, for a wide range of species, cloud conditions, and physical scales. New numerical methods developed under the auspices of this funding will also be publicly released."

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>The staggering growth of wireless communications systems has led to an increasing demand for spectrum to support commercial services, particularly in the frequencies below 3 GHz, where battery-powered mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets operate most efficiently.  It is desirable for such devices to be useful for a variety of applications, and in a variety of locations that have differing available spectrum. Currently this is achieved, in a smart phone for example, by a collection of hardware solutions, with one for each standard. This is complex and expensive, and such receivers will not be sufficiently adaptable for future spectrum usage. It is desirable to have a single hardware solution that is capable of receiving a broad spectrum and then selecting a particular transmission from it a based on the local spectral conditions and the application.  Adaptable solutions such as this do not currently exist due in large part to the interference that occurs when a desired signal is weak and is crowded by a channel containing a high power signal.  There are high dynamic range receivers that tolerate such disparate signal levels, but they are not adaptable over large bandwidths.  In this project, a novel high-dynamic range receiver topology that promises to enable the reception of a wide instantaneous bandwidth will be explored.  The topology is enabled by new signal processing concepts and integrated circuit technologies. The research undertaken will range from the basic theory to experimental demonstration. <br/><br/>Reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI), e.g., cellular, radio, TV, satellite and radar signals, and interference from microwave ovens, is crucial for the future of radio astronomical discoveries. When studying celestial radio signals, it is not uncommon for the scientists to puzzle over mysterious interference. To avoid RFI, the radio astronomers select sparsely populated areas to set up their telescopes. In some cases, the quiet zones around the radio telescopes have to be established to limit the use of airwares. Therefore, the technology of RFI mitigation is a critical component needed by radio astronomy science in increasingly challenging RFI environments. This project brings together researchers in radio astronomy, statistical array signal processing, radio frequency instrumentation, digital signal processing, wireless communications, and software defined radios to address these challenges and boost the science of radio astronomy by introducing a novel framework that provides the necessary analytical tools for modeling, analyzing, and operating radio telescope arrays in complex RFI environments.<br/><br/>Mitigating RFI in radio astronomy is an interdisciplinary research area which combines the efforts of scientists from various fields including electrical engineering, physics, astronomy, computer science, and astrophysics. Opportunities created by developing RFI mitigation techniques by the joint team of University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA) of the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) researchers will have a direct impact in the number of students participating in STEM careers. The success of this project will be beneficial to both the commercial and the scientific communities. Recently, CARA teamed up with SpaceX, a leading commercial manufacturer of orbital launch vehicles, to create the Space Craft Tracking and Astronomical Research into Gigahertz Astrophysical Transient Emission (STARGATE), a space technology innovation center that combines higher education, research, economic development, and commercialization. The future connections developed between STARGATE's technology/business incubator and the Dallas Telecom Corridor will open up new opportunities for technology transfer and better planning of spectrum use."

Thus, understanding the properties of a galaxy's cold gas component will tell us both how the star formation process changes over time and how this affects galaxies. Using a recently completed survey of carbon monoxide gas in a sample of nearby galaxies, the proposers will (1) measure how the molecular gas is used up, in order to test how star formation in the galaxies is affected; (2) map the locations of this gas in the galaxies to determine if/how these locations affect star formation; and (3) measure how the gas is flowing into and out of the galaxies to determine how this affects structural changes in the galaxies over time.  In particular, some questions that can be answered from this research include:  What factors affect the conversion of molecular gas into stars? How is molecular gas structured? How do galaxies grow and age?  This proposal will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and our understanding of these objects.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal plans to combine spatially resolved spectroscopy of carbon monoxide molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations for a sample of 125 nearby galaxies. Measuring spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion time scales as a function of various galaxy properties, using diagnostics of spectral lines to probe diffuse molecular gas, and constraining the rates of gas in- and outflow for these galaxies has the potential to add greatly to our understanding of star formation in normal galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies across a range of redshifts allow us to witness the growth and aging of the galaxy population. It has long been recognized that these processes are driven by the rise and fall of star formation, which is ultimately linked to the supply of cold gas. Further progress in understanding the regulation of star formation in galaxies, however, requires additional observational constraints beyond the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By exploiting a unique combination of the largest, most homogeneous interferometric CO survey of galaxies to date (the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution, or EDGE) and one of the principal ongoing optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys (CALIFA), the project team will confront models of star formation and galaxy evolution with uniform, high quality measurements of gas masses and star formation rates, supplemented by a vast array of additional data, including star formation history, stellar mass, nuclear activity, and the metallicity and kinematics of the gas and stars. These studies will be conducted on a spatially resolved basis across a well-defined sample that is representative of the nearby Universe, and will thus inform future studies of star formation and mass assembly at all redshifts undertaken by JWST and ALMA."

This project identifies the aspects of theoretical models in need of revision and proposes a path to update the models.  This will enable accurate (within 1%) measurements of stellar masses and radii. Precise determination of fundamental stellar properties is critical to many branches of astrophysics, from studying the life cycles of stars to determining distances throughout the universe. The advances in modelling approaches and classification are applicable to many problems in astronomy, physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. Conducting this program at a primarily undergraduate institution will provide opportunities undergraduate students learn modern research tools and techniques.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop the following improvements to their eclipsing binary modelling codes: (a) optimize stellar surface discretization to mitigate systematics in distorted systems and to be able to model more complicated structures such as accretion disks; (b) systematically treat Doppler boosting for all modelled binaries; (c) devise a numerical framework for the Generalized Roche Potential that will allow for tilted spin axes of components to the orbital axis; (d) rigorously treat multiple body systems, predicting eclipse timing variations, tertiary eclipses, dynamical interactions of extended bodies, and other related phenomena; (e) revise the limb darkening treatment to resolve the ingress/egress fitting problems and, consequently, eliminate systematics from the determination of stellar radii; (f) implement a new morphological classification scheme based on modern embedding algorithms; (g) provide a new formalism for statistical error estimates using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian inference to resolve a long-standing issue of underestimated parameter errors; (h) account for finite integration time corrections; and (i) write a back-end in python that will allow code parallelization in high performance computing and make it available to the broader astronomical community."

If we detect this radio emission from a planet, we learn that it has a magnetosphere that can shield the planet from outside radiation and protect any biology that could be present. The investigator will use the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array radio telescope to search for these signals from 2500 planetary systems continuously over 5 years.

Planetary magnetospheres serve as shields for potential biospheres from harmful high-energy particles from the host star and beyond. The detection of this radio emission at an exoplanet would be very significant, as it allows the direct measurement of the magnetic field strength of the planet, indicating whether the atmosphere of the planet can survive the intense magnetic activity of its host star.

Comet activity seen at large distances from the Sun is often caused by CO. The amount of CO can differ by up to 5 times between comets. These large differences in CO can be clues to how the comet formed or how it has changed with time. These investigators will first use a large amount of comet spectra to study the activity of CO in two bright comets - Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake - and update an existing model for CO activity in comets. They will then use this model to learn how CO is made at greater distances from the Sun, and test the model with old and new telescopic observations of comets at different distances, and other objects that are in the outer Solar System. This research serves the national interest by promoting our understanding of what gases are in comets, what the comets' structures are like, and how they formed and changed through their lifetimes. Graduate and undergraduate students at the university where the lead investigator works will be observing, reducing and analyzing the comet spectra.<br/><br/>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a major contributor to comet comae, and often drives the activity of comets beyond 3 AU. Substantial evidence indicates that relative CO abundances can vary by factors of about 5 between comets. This variation could be an important clue to either differences in cometary formation or processing history. Gaseous emission spectra are key to unlocking mysteries of these comets, since super-volatile sublimation drives the observed cometary activity and spectra can be used to put physical and chemical constraints on nucleus models. The investigators will use a large dataset of mm-wavelength spectra of comets already in hand, and obtain new spectra with telescope time that is already secured. The project has three parts: 1) Determine excitation and collisional parameters for comae using maps of CO and other molecular emission in two bright comets (Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake), and a 1D-spherical hybrid kinetic/dusty gas hydrodynamic model. Test the model at larger heliocentric distances with new CO maps of comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 at about 6 AU. 2) Derive new CO production rates using the improved coma model with new data, and recalculate them for comets in the literature. 3) Study the newly-recalculated CO production rates for a group of distantly-active comets to help construct a new model of distantly-active comet nuclei. As part of this last task, the investigators will also compare the CO production rates in two long-period comets and two Centaurs to explore the importance of nucleus size and thermal evolution of CO in outer Solar System objects. Graduate and undergraduate students will be incorporated in the research to be conducted in observing, reducing and analyzing millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy of comets."

These smaller asteroids that were formed during the break-ups are the rocks that fall to Earth: smaller pieces of the asteroids are meteorites, and larger pieces become those asteroids that could threaten Earth with a big impact.  Those asteroids that all come from one original asteroid are called a ""family.""  Astronomers use telescopes and instruments to look at the types of rocks on the asteroids in the families we find today to see if they have similar compositions.  Comparing the orbits and the compositions in an asteroid family gives us information on how long ago the break-up of the asteroid parent happened.  The Principal Investigator will observe about 35 asteroids near the large asteroid (6) Hebe to learn their compositions and, from that, their possible family beginning.  This research serves the national interest by promoting the progress of planetary astronomy, as well as providing information to secure national defense and welfare when Earth is threatened by the possible impact of a large asteroid.  The project will include students, aiming especially to identify female and disabled students as possible, to teach them how a scientific study is conducted.<br/><br/>Asteroid families are a collection of objects formed during the collisional breakup of a parent asteroid or as the ejecta from a large impact onto a parent body.  These events are major sources of the meteoroids that fall to Earth as meteorites, and of the Earth-approaching objects which constitute a potential impact hazard.  Asteroid families eventually diffuse orbitally to become the background asteroid population; as such, the time scale of diffusion constrains the ages of families and the collisional rate in the asteroid belt.  The H-chondrite meteorites exhibit a range of metamorphism suggesting deep excavation from their parent body, and spectral properties similar to asteroid (6) Hebe.  This research seeks a spectroscopic investigation of 35 asteroids in the dynamical region near Hebe to test for the presence of a small dynamical family of H-chondrite composition.  Detection or non-detection of such a family would place constraints on the formation of impact-generated families by providing data to the modeling community to test orbital diffusion models in regions proximate to resonances, as well as provide an explanation for the diverse thermal histories of the H-chondrites.  The proposed research effort would also provide a strong test of spectroscopic and dynamical predictions regarding asteroid family identification.  The PI will also focus on recruiting and teaching students, emphasizing female and disabled individuals as possible, the specific scientific investigation and writing techniques that would prepare them to become strong, diverse scientists and educators in the globally competitive STEM workforce."

Wilson overlooking Los Angeles sits a Y-shaped array of six 1-m aperture telescopes. Unlike telescopes located on other mountaintops, these six are not used independently of each other, but are instead used in unison to effectively form a single larger telescope, an interferometric array, in which the optical and near-infrared light from each of the telescopes is combined with the light from its neighbors. Operation of the six 1-m telescopes as an interferometric array results in the ability to detect finer details (spatial resolution) in astronomical sources than would be possible if the 1-m telescopes were utilized individually. With physical separations between the six 1-m telescopes ranging from 33 to 331 meters, spatial resolutions better than 1 milliarcsecond are achieved. This far exceeds the resolution of the largest ground-based and orbiting telescopes, and is even an order of magnitude better than will be possible with the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) currently under development. Since construction of the Mt. Wilson array was completed in 2005 by Georgia State University's Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA), the Mt. Wilson interferometric array has yielded the first direct detection of gravity darkening on a single star, the first angular diameter for a halo population star, the first image of a single, main-sequence star, the first direct image of an interacting binary, and first images of the expanding fireball around a nova just 15 hours after its discovery. The funded work will significantly improve the interferometric array's ability to detect faint targets (sensitivity) and scientific throughput by completing an adaptive optics upgrade for each of the six 1-m telescopes. The sensitivity will be improved by 0.5 to 3 magnitudes, depending on the seeing conditions, and the scientific throughput will be enhanced by a factor of 3-5.  Access to the Mt. Wilson interferometer is afforded to consortium members but also to the general astronomical community through an open allocation process managed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). Through the array, CHARA is training the next generation of scientific and technical experts in the field of interferometry, and scientific results emerging from the facility are incorporated in undergraduate courses as well as public outreach activities. Funding for completing the Mt. Wilson optical/near-IR interferometer upgrade is being provided through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program of the NSF.<br/><br/>The funded work will complete the first major facility upgrade of the CHARA array since initial construction. Georgia State's Dr. T. ten Brummelaar and collaborators have carefully considered the most cost-effective approaches to enhance the sensitivity of the instrument. The principal goal of the funded work is to add deformable mirrors (DM) to each of the six 1-m telescopes, completing the development and implementation of full, fast AO capabilities at each telescope. Together, these modifications should yield sensitivity increases 0.5 to 3 magnitudes at H band, and increase the number of nights of high-quality data by about a factor of 3 in the summer and 5 in the winter, with the integration time required to reach a specific SNR reduced by a factor of up to 3. New important areas of study include the study of highly reddened targets such debris disks around young stars, T-Tauri disks, and accretion flows onto YSOs."

Despite almost a decade of observations from the Galileo spacecraft, it is still not clear whether Europa is merely a passive ice shell with a thin surface layer of active chemistry, or a geologically active body with a chemically rich ocean. One key to resolving the issue is determining the relationship between the icy surface and the interior ocean chemistry. Recent models suggest hydrated sulfuric acid created by ion bombardment should be abundant in the trailing hemisphere, with hydrated salts deposited by ocean evaporation more dominant elsewhere. Galileo data are of insufficient spectroscopic resolution to constrain the models in detail; but modern infrared spectrographs with adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes are capable of mapping the surface chemistry. The Principal Investigator and collaborators will observe Europa using the adaptive optics system on the Keck telescope to obtain unprecedentedly high spectral resolution and moderate spatial resolution from the near infrared through the thermal infrared, and will chemically map the surface of Europa, identifying salts and radiation products and determining their spatial distributions. They will construct a comprehensive model of the sources and sinks of chemical species on Europa's surface, disentangle indigenous and exogenous materials, and begin to explore the chemical composition of the unseen ocean beneath the icy crust. The project will constitute the Ph.D. dissertation work of a graduate student, and an undergraduate student will be involved in the project through the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program. The Principal Investigator will communicate research results to the public through a variety of outreach activities."

Comet 46P/Wirtanen will be especially bright.  The investigators will collect images and spectra of these three small comets whose orbits are controlled by Jupiter's presence.  The observations during their passages near the sun this year will provide future studies with significant data to quantify compositions and physical characteristics of gases and dust around the comet, investigate the presence of icy grains, and determine common aspects or key differences among the comets.  These observations are time critical as these good observing conditions will not present themselves again for over a decade for comet 21P, and more than two decades for comets 46P and 64P.  The investigators will share their interpretations of the measured cometary activity, as well as the expected stunning and informative images of these comets, with the broader community through various public talks.<br/><br/>Unlike the hyperactive comet 46P, most Jupiter-family comets display a level of activity that can be accounted for by sublimation from a small fraction of their surface area. Comet 103P/Hartley 2 (the target of the NASA space probe Deep Impact), on the other hand, is a representative member of a hyperactive population that, paradoxically, exhibit active fractions > 100%.  During its flyby of Hartley 2, Deep Impact observed a large carbon dioxide jet, suffused with small grains of water ice, originating from one lobe of the comet. The carbon dioxide escaping from the nucleus likely dragged subsurface water-ice grains into the coma. Once in the coma, the distributed ice grains dramatically increased the surface area for water vapor sublimation, explaining Hartley 2's hyperactivity. This model suggests that hyperactive comets are governed by subsurface volatiles with low sublimation temperatures that entrain ice grains to produce anomalously high-water production rates.  Since the Deep Impact measurements, however, no other hyperactive comet has been sufficiently observed to confirm the applicability of the Hartley 2 model; this will change with observations of 46P.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vast filaments of matter coalesce into galaxies under gravity.  However, the exact nature of this coalescence is  poorly understood.  Recent discoveries of galaxies in the process of forming, called proto-galactic disks, may provide key missing information.  This project will undertake a systematic survey of dozens of them using state-of-the-art observations.  Such observations will obtain both images and spectroscopy (precise, quantitative colors) simultaneously.  These data will probe the physical conditions of galaxies-in-formation for the first time.  The investigators will disseminate their results to a broad audience through public lectures and a coordinated social media campaign.<br/><br/>There are two competing models for coalescing gas into galactic disks:  In the hot accretion model, intergalactic gas falls into halos and is shocked to many millions of degrees.  Alternatively, in the cold accretion model, this gas falls into halos at a relatively ""cold"" temperature of ~10,000s of degrees.  This proposal seeks to discriminate between these two models by undertaking a survey of proto-galactic disks.  Martin and collaborators have previously studied such a proto-galactic disk, ~100 kpc in size, and linked to the cosmic web by a gas filament, and found evidence of cold accretion.   The system is illuminated by a nearby quasar, and therefore amenable to 2D spectroscopy in Lyman-alpha and other spectral lines.  These exciting observations are now being pursued by other teams.  Only with recent instrumentation have such studies become feasible.  In this proposal, the investigators seek to expand their sample by conducting a systematic survey of proto-galactic disks using integral field spectroscopy with the Palomar Cosmic Web Imager (PCWI) and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI).  These instruments are ideally suited to this type of investigation, and the PI of this proposal is the PI of the KCWI instrument.  A preliminary pilot survey shows a promising number of targets for study in their full sample."

The maximum luminosity can equal that of a billion suns and matter is thrown into space at a few percent of the speed of light. As the explosion causes the star to expand and thin out, the signals from successive layers reveal the nature of the interior of the star. New insight into the formation of compact objects (neutron stars and black holes) can be acquired. The ejected matter is enriched in new elements, thus SNe are the main drivers of the nuclear evolution of the Universe. SNe may eject matter from galaxies in SN-heated galactic winds. They are an important factor in the physical evolution of galaxies. Finally, because they are so bright, SNe also serve as exquisite indicators of extragalactic distances. They measure the cosmic distance scale and determine the history of the cosmic expansion.  The research on supernovae will also be integrated into the extremely successful TAMU Physics Festival, which attracts over 4,000 people nationwide each year.

The field of SN spectropolarimetry is now poised to pass from the phase of constructing broad outlines of phenomenology to doing detailed physics-driven probes of the explosions and their aftermath. Many recent observations point strongly towards a double-degenerate progenitor scenario for at least a significant fraction of Type Ia SNe. But the apparent sphericity of the ejecta throughout different chemical layers poses a serious challenge to the double-degenerate models.   Very early observations of SN Ia should yield new constraints on the progenitor systems and explosion mechanism. Imaging polarimetry with high spatial resolution will also provide new insights into the nature of circumstellar and interstellar dust, and the comparison of interstellar dust particles in extragalactic space and the Milky Way.  Polarimetry of SNe therefore offers the best chance of directly resolving the issue of dust extinction in supernova cosmology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Galaxies, like our Milky Way, are rich in interstellar gas and dust clouds.  Gravity causes some interstellar clouds to collapse and form stars.  The largest, brightest, hottest, and most massive stars that form are called ""OB stars.""  OB stars are seen at their birthplaces because in their short lifetimes they do not have time to move very far from the collapsing interstellar clouds from which they formed.  The light from these OB stars is energetic enough to create ""HII Regions.""  HII regions are hot bubbles of fully ionized gas that surround their parent OB stars.  OB star formation and the HII regions that go with it are mostly confined to the spiral arms of galaxies.  HII regions are tracers of Galactic spiral structure.<br/><br/>Collaborations with Haystack Observatory and Green Bank Observatory (GBO) will bring the excitement of radio astronomy to Boston University undergraduates and provide mentors at the Physics Inspiring the Next Generation (PING) Summer Camp for 9th grade girls and boys held at Green Bank.  PING is a collaboration between GBO and the National Society of Black Physicists.<br/><br/>The OB star chemical abundances indicate the present state of the interstellar gas and reveal the elemental enrichment caused by the nuclear processing of many stellar generations.  They thus provide unique and important tracers of billions of years of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE).  The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey (SHRDS) will use the Australian Telescope Compact Array to find hundreds of heretofore unknown HII regions.  The SHRDS extends the successful Green Bank Telescope and Arecibo HRDS projects to the Southern sky; nearly half of the Milky Way disk cannot be observed from the Northern Hemisphere.  The SHRDS will improve the Galactic HII region census in the largest unexplored part of the Milky Way disk where the location of the spiral arms and the galactic bar is especially uncertain.  It will give the first complete map of where massive stars are forming in the entire Milky Way disk.  This map will allow a detailed analysis of the overall structure of OB-star formation sites in the Milky Way and how the physical properties of HII regions change across the disk.<br/><br/>New Galactic HII regions are discovered by detecting radio recombination line (RRL) radiation from candidate HII region targets. These targets are identified by comparing infrared and radio continuum images from existing surveys of the sky.  Comparing far-IR and radio continuum survey data leads to a list of some 2,000 candidate HII regions in the Galaxy.  RRL spectroscopic confirmation is needed to prove that a candidate is an H II region and to give its velocity.  The recombination lines give kinematic distances and electron temperatures for the nebulae.  Together, these allow derivation of the properties of the ionizing stars and the heavy element abundances, the metallicities, of the HII region gas.  A Galactic scale map of HII region metallicities can inform both GCE and the merger history of the Milky Way.  This project will achieve an areal density of sources, distributed throughout the Galactic disk, that can show local zones of metal enrichment (or depletion).  This would provide evidence for mergers, thus adding a new tool for the study of Galactic archaeology."

Williams will investigate this relationship between star formation and structure through three analyses.  She will use deep spectroscopy in conjunction with high-resolution imaging to study the kinematic properties and ionization conditions (diagnostics of the energy input into the interstellar gas) in star-forming galaxies.  This study will indicate if compact morphology in galaxies enhances feedback.  She will also use imaging and spectroscopy from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to test theories about the mode of stellar mass buildup in the first galaxies to quench star formation.  Finally, she will combine the JWST data with a molecular gas survey that will address the relationship between star formation efficiency and structure in galaxies.  For the educational component of her work, Williams will revive an astronomy course at the Tohono O'odham Community College.  She will also establish a mentoring network, which will encourage students to continue their education beyond community college."

Although usually detected only through their gravity, there is another method to reveal otherwise unobservable BHs: stellar tidal disruptions, which are the destruction of a star that happens to pass extremely close to such a BH.  The exciting and innovative techniques already developed to tackle this situation will be extended and improved and will have significant impact across many fields that require numerical calculations.<br/><br/>Over roughly the last decade, dozens of these Tidal Disruption Events have now been discovered from the luminous flare each one produces.  This characteristic flare gradually decays over a span of weeks to months.  Unfortunately, the old theory has trouble explaining the new data, and its assumptions must be questioned.  Recent work has opened new ways of thinking about these events, but progress has been hampered by the extreme computational demands of conventional numerical simulation methods.  The present team has built a new simulation infrastructure that overcomes these obstacles, and permits high-quality calculations incorporating full general relativity and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics.  This tool enables three new avenues of research: (1) understanding the nature of both the accretion flow onto the black hole and the ejection of unbound debris after the star is torn apart; (2) exploring how black hole spin may shape the accretion flow and possibly support relativistic jets; and (3) providing quantitative predictions of the light curves and spectra produced.<br/><br/>Societal benefits come from training a young scientist in the broadly applicable techniques of large-scale numerical simulation, expanding modern instructional methods in undergraduate physics education, and developing the innovative computing methodology for future public release."

One interesting class of stars, known as Be stars, rotate so rapidly that they somehow shed material that then forms in a disk around their equators.  In order to better understand how these disks are formed and why they occasionally seem to disappear, researchers at the University of Oklahoma, Lowell Observatory, and the University of Toledo have formed a team to carry out an intensive study of these systems.

This program will support graduate students at the University of Oklahoma and at the University of Toledo, as well as undergraduate students at all three institutions.  They will develop research-based planetarium shows that satisfy state education standards.

These stars weigh more than the Sun and yet are only 10 miles across, making them the densest objects next to black holes. Some of these neutron stars are seen as radio pulsars, which emit beams of radio emission detectable by telescopes on Earth as they spin. The rotation periods of pulsars are incredibly stable,  allowing them  to be used as ultra-precise cosmic clocks for fundamental physics experiments.  Roughly 300 of the 2500 known pulsars are in binary systems with other stars, and only 10 of these are in binary systems with other neutron stars. The large masses and short orbital periods of these double neutron star binaries make them remarkable laboratories for fundamental physics, and in particular for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity. One of these double neutron star binaries is truly exceptional, as it is the only one in which both of the neutron stars are detectable as radio pulsars. This makes the tests of general relativity more precise than for any other system and provides the best test ever of general relativity in the so-called strong-field regime. We also observe interactions between the two pulsars which can be used to help understand pulsar emission physics. This proposal will fund analysis of high-precision data taken with the Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, WV, that will provide even better tests of general relativity and provide crucial information about the emission mechanisms and geometries of the two pulsars in the system. The information gleaned from the observations of this system is truly unique and the goals could not be achieved through any other means.<br/><br/>While the investigators are focused on one system, the implications of the work are vast. The techniques they develop will be crucial for future double pulsar systems sure to be discovered  through upcoming wide-field pulsar surveys.   They will also develop an animation which will  be of interest  to  the general public, students, and scientists.  This animation will show how the pulse profile of B varies with time due to geodetic precession and the changing influence of pulsar A. These animations will be hosted on a website which will include other educational materials on the Double Pulsar, pulsar properties, general relativity, and gravitational waves<br/><br/>General relativity (GR) is the most elegant and complete description of gravity ever produced. The investigators will make more sensitive  GR tests, including the elimination  of alternative theories of gravity and, possibly, the measurement of second-order Post-Keplerian corrections to lead to the first measurement of a NS moment of inertia.  This would provide a unique constraint on the NS equation of state. This work will also lead to measurement of fundamental properties of the system that will inform understanding of binary evolution, pulsar emission physics, and detection rates for ground-based interferometers that cannot be measured in any other way. It will also provide crucial input for gravitational wave detectors, facilitating one of the most important scientific milestones of the decade."

Understanding BH XRBs is key to learning about other types of black holes as well.

Salvesen will then compare the simulations with the observed properties of BH-XRBs to determine if the emission and absorption spectra of these objects can be used to understand the influence of strong magnetic fields on black hole accretion disks. Salvesen will also create the Astronomy Sound of the Month (ASOM) website and develop ""sonification"" workshops to convey basic astronomy concepts to visually impaired or English-language learning K-12 students."

Thus, understanding the properties of a galaxy's cold gas component will tell us both how the star formation process changes over time and how this affects galaxies. Using a recently completed survey of carbon monoxide gas in a sample of nearby galaxies, the proposers will (1) measure how the molecular gas is used up, in order to test how star formation in the galaxies is affected; (2) map the locations of this gas in the galaxies to determine if/how these locations affect star formation; and (3) measure how the gas is flowing into and out of the galaxies to determine how this affects structural changes in the galaxies over time.  In particular, some questions that can be answered from this research include:  What factors affect the conversion of molecular gas into stars? How is molecular gas structured? How do galaxies grow and age?  This proposal will provide insight into the process of galaxy formation and our understanding of these objects.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>This proposal plans to combine spatially resolved spectroscopy of carbon monoxide molecular gas, ionized gas and stellar populations for a sample of 125 nearby galaxies. Measuring spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion time scales as a function of various galaxy properties, using diagnostics of spectral lines to probe diffuse molecular gas, and constraining the rates of gas in- and outflow for these galaxies has the potential to add greatly to our understanding of star formation in normal galaxies.<br/><br/>Observations of galaxies across a range of redshifts allow us to witness the growth and aging of the galaxy population. It has long been recognized that these processes are driven by the rise and fall of star formation, which is ultimately linked to the supply of cold gas. Further progress in understanding the regulation of star formation in galaxies, however, requires additional observational constraints beyond the molecular gas mass and star formation rate. By exploiting a unique combination of the largest, most homogeneous interferometric CO survey of galaxies to date (the Extragalactic Database for Galaxy Evolution, or EDGE) and one of the principal ongoing optical integral field unit (IFU) surveys (CALIFA), the project team will confront models of star formation and galaxy evolution with uniform, high quality measurements of gas masses and star formation rates, supplemented by a vast array of additional data, including star formation history, stellar mass, nuclear activity, and the metallicity and kinematics of the gas and stars. These studies will be conducted on a spatially resolved basis across a well-defined sample that is representative of the nearby Universe, and will thus inform future studies of star formation and mass assembly at all redshifts undertaken by JWST and ALMA."

However, in the last few billion years (roughly the most recent 25% of cosmic history), many galaxies stopped forming stars and seem to have entered a permanent state of quiescence. Our own Milky Way galaxy may be undergoing a similar fate. Astronomers are not only trying to understand what initially stops star formation in these galaxies, but what keeps it from re-starting when fresh supplies of gas become available. This project seeks to understand a newly-discovered phenomenon that may play a role. So-called ""red geyser"" galaxies host super-massive black holes at their centers that periodically emanate a wind of hot gas that spreads through the entire galaxy. This hot gas may be able to heat up cooler reservoirs and prevent them from collapsing into new stars. This project will confirm the relationship between red geysers and central black holes and study red geyser winds in detail to understand how they impact their host galaxies. This program will also contribute to training in research methods for students. It will support the use of specialized Jupyter-type Marvin notebooks for astronomical research through training classes for high school students and early undergraduates. This training will provide experience and job-skills for next generation researchers.<br/><br/>These investigators have recently discovered a new class of quiescent, relatively common early- type galaxy that hosts large-scale, AGN-driven winds. These ""red geysers''---found in 5-10% of the quiescent population---may be the missing energy source needed to maintain low levels of star formation in galaxies where star formation in general ceased long ago. Initial integral field observations from the relatively low resolution (R~2000; 2.5 arcsec FWHM) MaNGA Survey revealed characteristic ionized gas velocity fields. This project addresses two key issues through follow-up observations with the Keck Observatory. Investigators seek to determine (1) whether the tell-tale enhanced emission is due to shocks or gas over-densities, and (2) how the wind energy couples to the cooler ambient gas in order to suppress star formation. Both questions will be addressed by analyzing recently obtained Keck spectroscopic data that spatially and spectrally resolves the multicomponent gas structure with finer detail, allowing the investigators to search for shocks and turbulence at the interface between the wind and cooler material. These Keck observations, obtained for six red geysers over two nights, will also constrain a quantitative wind model to confirm the role of red geysers in suppressing late-time star formation. Finally, they will test the hypothesis that these winds are driven by low-luminosity AGN feedback by stacking the available but shallow radio flux observations to determine whether radio AGN activity is more often associated with optical identification of the red geyser phenomenon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such an enormous energy release has profound effects on the galaxies where supernovae occur.  For example, the shock waves can trigger bursts of star formation when they encounter dense interstellar clouds.  Supernovae are also responsible for the production and distribution of most of the heavy elements in the Universe.  Virtually all elements from carbon to iron on the periodic table were forged in the cores of massive stars and distributed around the cosmos through supernova explosions.  The central themes of this research are to better understand (1) how supernovae explode, (2) how their huge energy release affects their host galaxies, and (3) how supernovae contribute to the chemical changes in the Universe.  The investigator and their students will focus on selected bright supernova remnants in the Milky Way.  Also, they will study the average effect of supernova remnants in the nearby galaxies.  The investigator is at Middlebury College, an ethnically diverse college in rural Vermont.  The investigator will work with undergraduate students and help them publish their research results.  The investigator will also reach out to the public via the striking images from the Emission Line Atlas to be published in popular literature and on the web.<br/><br/>This project will concentrate especially on young supernova remnants (SNRs), where observations made over three decades reveal significant expansion.  In young core-collapse SNRs, where uncontaminated ejecta fragments are freely expanding, image and spectroscopy data will be used to obtain proper motions and Doppler velocities for dozens of surviving ejecta knots to obtain 3-dimensional models and explore possible asymmetries.  Chemical abundances inferred from spectra can tie present knots to their origin in specific core layers of the progenitor stars.  In young Type Ia SNRs, specifically Tycho (SN1572) and RCW86 (SN185), proper motions of Balmer-dominated filaments that delineate their outer shells will be measured to gauge their expansion.  High signal-to-noise spectra of numerous filaments in both objects will enable determination of the shock velocities, which together with proper motions can yield the first precise distances to these key objects.  The investigator will also statistically investigate the properties of large SNR populations in an entire galaxy, where SNRs can be seen unimpeded by the foreground dust that hides from view most SNRs in the Milky Way.  The investigator and collaborators will identify the SNR populations in the two nearby galaxies which had the most supernovae in the past century."

One of the ways that astronomers do this is by using a certain type of supernova (SN), or exploding star, in a galaxy as a measuring stick.  A Type Ia SN results from the detonation of an old, small white dwarf (WD) star, and because WD stars are fairly similar in size, the observable features of Type Ia SNe are similar, meaning that the relative difference in brightness between two Type Ia SNe in different galaxies is primarily due to a difference in distance.  For this method to work properly to advance cosmology, it is essential that astronomers have a better understanding of the details of Type Ia SNe and the differences among them.  A research group at Florida State University (FSU) will further this understanding by studying in detail the various Type Ia explosion scenarios, the structure of WD stars, the thermodynamics of the explosions, and the role of magnetic fields in supernovae.  They will do this through sophisticated computer models that produce simulated SNe to compare to observations.  The research team will include both graduate and undergraduate students, and the principal investigator and his team will develop and present shows at the FSU planetarium about SNe, cosmology, and related astronomy topics.<br/><br/>Thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, SNe Ia, are key in cosmology due to their brightness and the apparent homogeneity of their light curves.  However, the diversity of explosion scenarios and possible WD progenitor evolution with redshift pose a problem for high precision cosmology.  Explosion scenarios may include a WD explosion close to the Chandrasekhar mass (M_Ch), a sub-M_Ch WD, and the dynamical merger of two WDs.  For all scenarios, the team will use existing and new explosion models to calculate non-local thermodynamic equilibrium light curves, color-brightness relations, and near and mid-infrared spectra.  They will use the radiation-hydro code HYDRA and include hydrodynamics and positron transport.   Tools will be developed and employed for data analysis using existing observations as a benchmark."

Computer simulations have contributed greatly to our understanding of this accretion, and general relativistic (GR) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) codes have been developed and applied widely.  However, most methods do not include radiation, and the few that do can handle only limited regimes of optical depth.  This project will develop a GR radiation MHD (GRRMHD) code that can handle all optical depths, and use it to study a suite of problems related to luminous accretion disks.  The research group already has a radiation module developed for GR hydrodynamics, which they will add into their existing GRMHD code.  While that code development is underway, the team will study hydrodynamic disks with radiation and viscosity using their pre-existing methods.  Once the new technique is ready, it will be used for work on radiative magnetized disks, focusing on the structure of thin and thick radiation-dominated disks, the role of instabilities in these disks, and the generation of winds and jets by radiative acceleration.  The team has some in-house computer capacity for code testing and less demanding computations, but production runs will use NSF's XSEDE supercomputer resources.<br/><br/>This study will improve our understanding of these high-luminosity accretion flows, and even though the work is very technical, the major advances it represents should spark public interest.  The results will help to interpret the observational data that has been collected over the years, and will be very valuable for modeling quasar mode feedback in studies of galaxy formation and evolution.  The principal researcher has a strong track record in mentoring young scientists, especially women, and will actively seek opportunities to involve more of them in this research."

Maps of nearby galaxies show that they are clustered and that these clusters are separated by large voids, where little matter is present. Each cluster has one galaxy that is the brightest. Curiously, these Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) are often found at the center of their host cluster, and often contain the oldest and reddest stars around. One outstanding question in the field of extragalactic astronomy is the following: How and when do galaxies build-up their mass? This project will measure the ages and chemical compositions of BCGs from their cores to their outskirts. It will also calculate how long it would take a BCG to grow by merging with nearby systems. The results will help astronomers discriminate between various galaxy evolution scenarios.<br/> <br/>Imaging spectroscopy (IFU) of 25 local cluster galaxies and their nearby companions will be collected and analyzed. In addition to doubling the sample of IFU studied BCGs and companions, wide field observations obtained from this work represent the first spectroscopic study of a sample of intra-cluster light (ICL).  Focusing on the local universe means that its components can be studied in exquisite detail. To help elucidate the nature of the BCG and its formation, the objectives for the period of proposed work are to determine mechanisms and timescales that govern stellar mass build-up in the sample. The main deliverables include: 1) Maps of the kinematic properties and stellar populations of the BCGs, the close companions and the ICL. The location of the oldest and youngest stars within the galaxies can lend credence to whether or not the galaxies formed inside out. Whether the BCG is coeval with the intra-cluster light can be determined if the two have similar stellar populations, and if the surface brightness profile breaks; 2) Estimates of the timescale and relative contribution to the recent stellar mass buildup of BCGs and the ICL from major and minor mergers; 3) Constraints on the amount of any new or ?in situ? stellar mass buildup. This can be determined by examining the stellar populations, from searching for wet minor merging, or looking for cooling from a hot halo.  Determining the properties of these local systems will provide powerful constraints for cosmological models and will form an important comparison sample for higher-redshift BCGs already being compiled. Undergraduates will be heavily involved in every aspect of this project. Through performing their research with cutting edge data, visiting a national observatory site, and presenting their work to colleagues they will experience training in the technical and social skills required to enter STEM fields as graduate students or in industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Based on these observations, the best evidence suggests that both the SMBHs and the galaxy grow in mass over time.   How does this happen?   The researcher has a plan of observations that will show the connection between these central beasts (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However the observations are difficult.  Most SMBHs in the Universe are hidden from view: too distant to measure the gravitational pull on the stars by the SMBH, or too dim from the lack of gas falling onto the SMBH. <br/><br/>The researcher plans to use optical telescopes, which look at the sky automatically and repeatedly every night, to find rare transient events: when stars pass too close to SMBHs.  A 'starved' (dormant) black hole will reveal itself when an unlucky star passes close enough to be torn apart by tremendous tides expected near the SMBH.   Based on the brightness of the flare, when the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) happens, they will be able to weigh the central SMBH, estimate the black hole spin, as well as constrain the mass, radius, and internal structure of the disrupted star.<br/><br/>The project has several major intellectual merits:  1) The researcher clearly lays out the status of measuring intermediate-mass and supermassive black hole properties with tidal disruption events and convincingly details how to find thousands of TDE candidates.  3) They plan to increase the sensitivity of Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) Medium Deep Survey with stacking analysis and using the dataset to classify transients of all flavors is the step towards efficiently filtering observations with the new Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.  3) The researcher will help other scientists' research by sharing their machine-learning algorithms.<br/><br/>The researcher will enhance the Maryland GRAD-MAP program, which encourages women and under-represented groups in STEM fields.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and how these SMBHs are linked to their host galaxies.  Quasar winds are fundamentally linked to mass accretion onto rapidly growing SMBHs, and they also likely serve as agents of SMBH feedback into typical massive galaxies.  This project will advance understanding of several key aspects of quasar winds using an unprecedentedly large---and still growing---spectroscopic survey of multi-year ultraviolet broad absorption line (BAL) variability in about 2100 BAL quasars.  This survey is primarily based on spectra from the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and is about two orders of magnitude larger than past comparable surveys; supporting targeted spectroscopy is also obtained via Penn State's access to the queue-scheduled Hobby-Eberly Telescope.<br/><br/>The PI's annual summer workshops will serve as a high-leverage way of helping about 50 Pennsylvania high school teachers educate their thousands of students better about space, time, gravity, black holes, and the scientific method.  Teachers from underserved rural and urban school districts, including underrepresented minorities and women, will be specifically recruited with scholarship funds.  The workshops' programs will include an overview of the project's scientific discoveries and an associated activity, and the postdoctoral research associate will help with workshop planning and presentation.  The postdoctoral researcher will also work as a central member of PI's group, thereby developing his or her research, teaching, and outreach skills.  He or she will lead much of the analysis as well as many of the high-impact journal articles and presentations.  The postdoctoral researcher will also be a primary mentor of the undergraduate researcher, who will develop hands-on research skills via well-defined projects.<br/><br/>More technically, this project will use its database to provide the following specific advances: (1) unmatched large-scale measurements/limits of BAL acceleration and deceleration that constrain BAL-wind feedback into galaxies; (2) measurements of BAL vs. emission-line properties that test the drivers of BAL variability and quasar-wind models; (3) determination of the in-depth relations between BAL disappearance and emergence with associated improvements in direct BAL-lifetime estimates; (4) an understanding of the nature of unusually stable BALs and their possible relation to ongoing large-scale galactic feedback; and (5) determination of whether remarkable redshifted BAL troughs arise from rotationally dominated outflows or high-velocity infalling material.  These results will play an important role in transforming the field of multi-year BAL variability studies into one that supplies rigorous, large-sample constraints that can effectively guide models of quasar winds and their feedback.  They are expected to be the best such results available for at least a decade."

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is one example. Disk galaxies are composed of a thin and symmetric rotating disk of stars and gas. This project will determine when disk galaxies first formed in significant numbers. Researchers will measure the fraction of disk galaxies over the last 10 billion years. These fractions will be compared with two theoretical models for disk formation in order to understand how disks form. In addition, simulated observations will be made of theoretical models of galaxies. A large set of these simulated observations will be used to train a classification algorithm to automatically distinguish between disks and colliding galaxies, which are easily mistaken for disks. The resulting algorithm will then be applied to existing observations of hundreds of galaxies in order to identify the fraction of disks. This project will also establish an ""Astro Scholars"" annual week-long intensive mini-course targeted at students in local Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Scholars will receive financial support. Monthly follow- up after the summer program will extend the impact of the program for 6 months.<br/><br/>Current measurements of the fraction of disk galaxies are inaccurate. They do not take into account that some colliding galaxies can appear to be disk galaxies. To measure the fraction of disks over time, researchers will create disk criteria. These criteria will determine if a given observation indicates a disk or colliding galaxies. The criteria will be created with models of galaxies using publicly available suites, VELA and FIRE, of computer simulations. Researchers will simulate observations with mock catalogues that will be compared directly to observations, taking into account the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Researchers will create disk criteria by comparing the intrinsic states of the simulations (disk or collision) with the simulated observations. These criteria will indicate the probability an observation is a disk or colliding galaxies. These criteria will be applied to KMOS3D integral field unit observations of nearly 600 galaxies. They will measure the fraction of star-forming galaxies which are disks over time. The disk criteria will serve as a powerful tool for recent (and ongoing) large surveys of galaxy kinematics. They will be key for next-generation surveys that will push observations of galaxy kinematics to the very early universe, when the first galaxies formed, and galaxy collisions were even more frequent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>The staggering growth of wireless communications systems has led to an increasing demand for spectrum to support commercial services, particularly in the frequencies below 3 GHz, where battery-powered mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets operate most efficiently.  It is desirable for such devices to be useful for a variety of applications, and in a variety of locations that have differing available spectrum. Currently this is achieved, in a smart phone for example, by a collection of hardware solutions, with one for each standard. This is complex and expensive, and such receivers will not be sufficiently adaptable for future spectrum usage. It is desirable to have a single hardware solution that is capable of receiving a broad spectrum and then selecting a particular transmission from it a based on the local spectral conditions and the application.  Adaptable solutions such as this do not currently exist due in large part to the interference that occurs when a desired signal is weak and is crowded by a channel containing a high power signal.  There are high dynamic range receivers that tolerate such disparate signal levels, but they are not adaptable over large bandwidths.  In this project, a novel high-dynamic range receiver topology that promises to enable the reception of a wide instantaneous bandwidth will be explored.  The topology is enabled by new signal processing concepts and integrated circuit technologies. The research undertaken will range from the basic theory to experimental demonstration. <br/><br/>Reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI), e.g., cellular, radio, TV, satellite and radar signals, and interference from microwave ovens, is crucial for the future of radio astronomical discoveries. When studying celestial radio signals, it is not uncommon for the scientists to puzzle over mysterious interference. To avoid RFI, the radio astronomers select sparsely populated areas to set up their telescopes. In some cases, the quiet zones around the radio telescopes have to be established to limit the use of airwares. Therefore, the technology of RFI mitigation is a critical component needed by radio astronomy science in increasingly challenging RFI environments. This project brings together researchers in radio astronomy, statistical array signal processing, radio frequency instrumentation, digital signal processing, wireless communications, and software defined radios to address these challenges and boost the science of radio astronomy by introducing a novel framework that provides the necessary analytical tools for modeling, analyzing, and operating radio telescope arrays in complex RFI environments.<br/><br/>Mitigating RFI in radio astronomy is an interdisciplinary research area which combines the efforts of scientists from various fields including electrical engineering, physics, astronomy, computer science, and astrophysics. Opportunities created by developing RFI mitigation techniques by the joint team of University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and the Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA) of the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) researchers will have a direct impact in the number of students participating in STEM careers. The success of this project will be beneficial to both the commercial and the scientific communities. Recently, CARA teamed up with SpaceX, a leading commercial manufacturer of orbital launch vehicles, to create the Space Craft Tracking and Astronomical Research into Gigahertz Astrophysical Transient Emission (STARGATE), a space technology innovation center that combines higher education, research, economic development, and commercialization. The future connections developed between STARGATE's technology/business incubator and the Dallas Telecom Corridor will open up new opportunities for technology transfer and better planning of spectrum use."

This award supports the ongoing operations of Gemini for the international partnership. <br/><br/>The international Gemini partnership includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States as full participants; Australia and Korea are currently limited-term collaborators. To enable the international Gemini user community to conduct the highest priority science prescribed in the strategic plans of all the Gemini partner countries, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) proposes to position the Gemini Observatory as the world's most versatile optical-infrared 8-meter telescopes. In AURA's vision, research at Gemini will complement the scientific discoveries of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). AURA's proposal emphasizes the core values of (1) users' science driving Gemini operations and instrumentation and (2) understanding the needs of Gemini's diverse user communities. <br/><br/>Gemini is well-equipped to study diverse topics, including the solar system, planetary nebulae, star formation, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, the formation and evolution of galaxies, quasars and supermassive black holes, and the structure of the universe on the largest scales. Recent developments in instrumentation have brought Gemini to the forefront of research on extrasolar planets. AURA will continue to develop instrumentation that achieves excellent spatial and spectral resolving power and world-leading capabilities for adaptive optics on uniquely large scales, opening new scientific vistas in concert with the next-generation telescopes mentioned above. A vigorous visitor instrument program will complement the facility-class instruments, allowing community members to conduct their own experiments while at the same time opening new opportunities for all users. <br/><br/>AURA proposes a flexible operations model to attract and efficiently execute the best ideas in research. Gemini offers observational programs targeted towards a wide range of science needs, including an innovative Fast Turnaround program that enables researchers to turn a new idea into an executed program within weeks, and a Large and Long program designed for comprehensive studies requiring large amounts of observing time. AURA also maintains a range of observing modes to make the most efficient use of the Observatory. In addition to queue observations carried out by Observatory staff and classical observations carried out by scientists who travel to the telescope on their allotted nights, AURA has implemented a Poor Weather program that keeps track of observations that can be made in overcast conditions and a Priority Visitor mode that allows observers to come to the telescope for longer than their formal allocation and choose when to observe their targets. To further increase efficiency, AURA will develop the capability for staff to perform nighttime observations from remote base stations; indeed, remote operations from Hilo have already been commissioned at Gemini-North. <br/><br/>AURA strongly supports professional development for Gemini staff, particularly in the areas of project management and systems engineering, and includes tailored retention plans and succession planning to avoid disruptive changes in key personnel. AURA actively seeks to increase participation of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the workforce. Gemini's Diversity Advocates implement workforce development programs tailored to site-specific diversity issues in Chile and Hawai'i. AURA will continue refining and enhancing its successful workforce diversity practices for the term of this award. <br/><br/>AURA supports education and promotes to society the broader benefits that accrue from accomplishing Gemini's mission, proposing a series of activities that are designed to develop local STEM talent as well as to communicate Gemini's discoveries. AURA will continue its Journey through the Universe/Viaje al Universo, Live from Gemini, and AstroDay programs that reach over 8,000 K-12 students annually in Hawai'i and Chile, its internship program that places undergraduate and graduate students at the Observatory each year, and dissemination of information about the Observatory and its scientific output through press releases and social media. An assessment of Gemini's outreach programs will identify best practices and establish a process for ongoing evaluation throughout the term of the award. <br/><br/>Stakeholder communication is crucial to the success of Gemini. AURA's staffing model includes a core group of active scientists who conduct a portion of their own research at Gemini, keeping the managing organization tightly connected to the needs and perspectives of external users. AURA's interaction with the research community includes the organization of triennial Gemini science meetings and participation in the annual meetings of the astronomical societies in all the partner countries. The Observatory has regular contact with the National Gemini Offices in each partner country through its operations working group, and representatives of the international partners participate in the AURA and Gemini governing and operational management structures. <br/><br/>As part of AURA's management and oversight of Gemini, AURA will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of Gemini as well as AURA's own governance and business practices. Key Performance Indicators and both qualitative and quantitative assessments will inform Gemini activities and AURA policies to achieve optimal management and operation of Gemini."

Since it is funded with Federal funds, ATST construction is a Federal undertaking that must comply with a number of environmental and historic preservation statutes. The impacts of the ATST construction on the environmental, historical, and cultural assets atop Haleakala were the subject of a nearly five-year study that culminated in a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that was completed in August 2009.  <br/><br/>Since the summit of Haleakala is a ?traditional cultural place? that has cultural and spiritual significance to native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, the FEIS stipulates that the construction of the ATST will have impacts on the spiritual and cultural assets there.  A number of mitigation activities designed to minimize or mitigate such impacts are described in the compliance documents and are memorialized in the Record of Decision signed by former NSF Director, Arden L. Bement, Jr. in December 2009.  One of these designed to mitigate the direct, major, adverse, and long-term impacts to the summit as a TCP is through education and workforce development.  This award provides funding for a ten-year program at the University of Hawaii Maui College that will address the intersection between traditional Native Hawaiian culture and science.<br/><br/>This program will employ STEM educational strategies informed by traditional Native Hawaiian approaches to learning. AIK will create a ?pipeline? of Native Hawaiian STEM students from Maui County secondary schools by identifying and preparing students early in their education, with the support of secondary school math and science teachers and staff. The plan includes development of STEM curricula in the Hawaiian language, STEM faculty development at both secondary and postsecondary levels, and also seeks to engage parents, families, prospective employers, and community members, as well as various Native Hawaiian student networks, through a variety of community partner programs.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts and Importance<br/><br/>By integrating science with Native Hawaiian culture, this plan offers an innovative design for helping native peoples access 21st century economic opportunities. This plan also seeks to demonstrate to the Native Hawaiian and broader community that there exists space within the STEM community for native knowledge, experiences, and ways of learning to make significant contribution. Programs that are developed in this plan will benefit both Native Hawaiian and other Maui County and UHMC students. Finally, the complex social and environmental issues that confront the Hawaiian Islands require that the next generation of leaders be conversant in both science and culture. This plan addresses this need, by bringing together existing STEM scientific, Native Hawaiian cultural, and secondary and post-secondary educational resources to create a cohort of future leaders from an underserved population."

Recent discoveries of the enormous variety of planetary systems around stars beyond the Sun have only increased our curiosity about our own planetary system and why it appears the way it does.  One of the key tools to study the entire history of our Solar System is its Asteroid Belt, since that traces the migration of the giant planets, as well as epochs of major change and collisions, and it contains samples from nearly the entire suite of Solar System material from its very beginning.  This project will attempt to better identify families of asteroids that record the history of catastrophic asteroid collisions. <br/><br/>The project team will capitalize on the experience of one of the Co-PIs with developing visualizations by developing a visualization product specifically with planetariums in mind.  The visualization product they intend to produce will be called ""When Asteroids Collide"" and will engagingly visualize the structure and compositional make-up of the Asteroid Belt and its evolution in time.  It will highlight the creation and evolution of families across the asteroid belt and throughout time and help explain complicated asteroid dynamics.  The visualization will be circulated through the network of planetariums that have already reached out to Co-PI, as well as through the online and film festival avenues that he has used successfully to share his work with very broad audiences.<br/><br/>The census of known asteroid families is clearly incomplete as a function of time, across all types of asteroids, and across all regions of the Asteroid Belt.  This project would calibrate the project team's current techniques to understand their detection biases, and to develop new techniques to better extract and characterize these families in current and future datasets. It will be accomplished by building a calibration testbed using synthetic families implanted in current asteroid datasets to calibrate asteroid family detection tools, building new family detection tools utilizing the orbital elements and the known size-dependent Yarkovsky spreading of as a function of size, calibrating old and new tools and using them to create a de-biased census of the asteroid belt families as a function of their age, size and physical properties."

Because of the multi-disciplinary aspect of the Committee's goals, it is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The full Committee, comprised of 15 members, meets regularly, twice a year, and between meetings it works on crafting comments and other written documents in response to various regulatory proceedings. Some recent publications are: Handbook of Frequency Allocations and Spectrum Protection for Scientific Uses (National Academies Press, 2015).

Graur's research seeks to transform large spectroscopic survey observations into searches for transient events (transients), such as supernova explosions and the disruption of stars by black holes, that are thought to be important in the lifecycles of stars and galaxies. Graur will study two types of transients: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), which are supernovae occurring in two stars orbiting one another; and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE), which are bright flares produced when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy disrupts the material from a nearby star. Few SNe Ia and TDEs have been observed to date, however, and Graur's work has the potential to drastically increase the detections of SNe Ia and TDEs, allowing astronomers to study these transients in a statistical manner. Graur will also build a mentoring program in which postdoctoral scholars and graduate students will supervise high school students in advanced scientific research projects. <br/><br/>Graur will enhance his supernova detection code to enable detection of all types of transients in large scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys, starting with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will integrate the enhanced code into the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey. The focus of his research will be to enlarge the number of SNe Ia and TDE detections to make statistical analyses of these events possible. Assembling a statistical sample of SNe Ia would allow measurement of SNe Ia rates as a function of galaxy stellar mass, thereby improving constraints on the nature of SNe Ia progenitors. Similarly, enlarging the number of TDE detections through dedicated surveys would allow a better understanding of the behavior of TDEs, and stellar parameters inferred from the TDE emission would provide a novel method to measure SMBH masses and mass distributions. For the educational component of his work, Graur will develop a research mentoring program called SRMP@Harvard, in which about 15 postdoctoral scholars and advanced graduate students will supervise about 50 high school students from the Cambridge and Boston areas in active scientific research."

Although the black hole's gravitational influence is limited to a very small region at the center of the galaxy, surprisingly the black hole mass has been found to strongly correlate with the properties of the larger host galaxy. This suggests that black holes are essential components of galaxies, with the growth of one somehow affecting the growth of the other. Our understanding of the underlying physics, however, is limited by the current sample of galaxies. In particular, black hole mass determinations have been made in galaxies that are not representative of the global population. Our program seeks to address this troublesome bias by measuring black hole masses in 31 local galaxies using state-of-the-art observational and dynamical modeling methods. The proposed research will yield the largest uniform black hole survey carried out to date. By specifically targeting galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the existing sample, the PI will obtain a more complete census of local black holes in a wider range of galaxies. Forgoing the approach that has been used for years of measuring a few black holes at a time, and instead examining large, homogenous datasets of carefully selected samples is the ideal way to achieve a breakthrough in our understanding of how black holes and galaxies grow and evolve together.<br/><br/>The project also incorporates an educational component, reaching a potentially large number of people who may never opt to attend a science event on their own.

About 100 black hole mass measurements in nearby galaxies have been made to date, leading to the establishment of tight correlations between the mass of a central black hole and its host galaxy's large-scale properties. Our understanding of the underlying physics driving the empirical relations, however, is limited by the current sample of galaxies. In particular, black hole mass determinations have been made in galaxies that are not representative of the global population. Instead, galaxies with small sizes at a given luminosity have been preferentially targeted, as they are generally the easiest to observe and model. The project seeks to address this troublesome bias by weighing black holes in 31 local galaxies using adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy from the Gemini North telescope, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, wide-field integral field spectroscopy from McDonald Observatory, and state-of-the-art dynamical models. The proposed research will yield the largest uniform black hole survey carried out to date, and will significantly enhance the diversity of black hole hosts by targeting galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well represented in the existing sample. This benchmark study will produce a more complete census of black holes in a wide range of galaxies that have experienced diverse evolutionary pasts, and will provide a deeper understanding of black hole-galaxy co-evolution. Detailed investigations of large, carefully selected samples using a homogenous approach is the ideal way to make major progress in the field prior to the next generation of extremely large telescopes.<br/><br/>The program also incorporates an educational component, reaching a potentially large number of people who may never opt to attend a science event on their own.

Situated on the summits of Maunakea, Hawai'i and Cerro Pachon, Chile, the Gemini telescopes occupy the darkest, driest, and best-developed sites for astronomy in both hemispheres. The telescopes combine a large light-collecting area with exquisite image quality to maintain best-in-class capability that is particularly suited for rapid response to astronomical transients and high-resolution imaging. With the mission ""to advance our knowledge of the Universe by providing the international Gemini Community with forefront access to the entire sky"", Gemini provides the largest-aperture optical/infrared (OIR) telescopes in the world for general U.S. community access. This award supports the ongoing operations of Gemini for the international partnership.<br/><br/>The international Gemini partnership includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, and the United States as full participants; Australia and Korea are currently limited-term collaborators. To enable the international Gemini user community to conduct the highest priority science prescribed in the strategic plans of all the Gemini partner countries, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) proposes to position the Gemini Observatory as the world's most versatile optical-infrared 8-meter telescopes. In AURA's vision, research at Gemini will complement the scientific discoveries of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). AURA's proposal emphasizes the core values of (1) users' science driving Gemini operations and instrumentation and (2) understanding the needs of Gemini's diverse user communities. <br/><br/>Gemini is well-equipped to study diverse topics, including the solar system, planetary nebulae, star formation, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, the formation and evolution of galaxies, quasars and supermassive black holes, and the structure of the universe on the largest scales. Recent developments in instrumentation have brought Gemini to the forefront of research on extrasolar planets. AURA will continue to develop instrumentation that achieves excellent spatial and spectral resolving power and world-leading capabilities for adaptive optics on uniquely large scales, opening new scientific vistas in concert with the next-generation telescopes mentioned above. A vigorous visitor instrument program will complement the facility-class instruments, allowing community members to conduct their own experiments while at the same time opening new opportunities for all users.<br/><br/>AURA proposes a flexible operations model to attract and efficiently execute the best ideas in research. Gemini offers observational programs targeted towards a wide range of science needs, including an innovative Fast Turnaround program that enables researchers to turn a new idea into an executed program within weeks, and a Large and Long program designed for comprehensive studies requiring large amounts of observing time. AURA also maintains a range of observing modes to make the most efficient use of the Observatory. In addition to queue observations carried out by Observatory staff and classical observations carried out by scientists who travel to the telescope on their allotted nights, AURA has implemented a Poor Weather program that keeps track of observations that can be made in overcast conditions and a Priority Visitor mode that allows observers to come to the telescope for longer than their formal allocation and choose when to observe their targets. To further increase efficiency, AURA will develop the capability for staff to perform nighttime observations from remote base stations; indeed, remote operations from Hilo have already been commissioned at Gemini-North.<br/><br/>AURA strongly supports professional development for Gemini staff, particularly in the areas of project management and systems engineering, and includes tailored retention plans and succession planning to avoid disruptive changes in key personnel. AURA actively seeks to increase participation of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the workforce. Gemini's Diversity Advocates implement workforce development programs tailored to site-specific diversity issues in Chile and Hawai'i. AURA will continue refining and enhancing its successful workforce diversity practices for the term of this award. <br/><br/>AURA supports education and promotes to society the broader benefits that accrue from accomplishing Gemini's mission, proposing a series of activities that are designed to develop local STEM talent as well as to communicate Gemini's discoveries.  AURA will continue its Journey through the Universe/Viaje al Universo, Live from Gemini, and AstroDay programs that reach over 8,000 K-12 students annually in Hawai'i and Chile, its internship program that places undergraduate and graduate students at the Observatory each year, and dissemination of information about the Observatory and its scientific output through press releases and social media. An assessment of Gemini's outreach programs will identify best practices and establish a process for ongoing evaluation throughout the term of the award.<br/><br/>Stakeholder communication is crucial to the success of Gemini. AURA's staffing model includes a core group of active scientists who conduct a portion of their own research at Gemini, keeping the managing organization tightly connected to the needs and perspectives of external users. AURA's interaction with the research community includes the organization of triennial Gemini science meetings and participation in the annual meetings of the astronomical societies in all the partner countries. The Observatory has regular contact with the National Gemini Offices in each partner country through its operations working group, and representatives of the international partners participate in the AURA and Gemini governing and operational management structures. <br/><br/>As part of AURA's management and oversight of Gemini, AURA will regularly review the technical, financial, and administrative functioning of Gemini as well as AURA's own governance and business practices.  Key Performance Indicators and both qualitative and quantitative assessments will inform Gemini activities and AURA policies to achieve optimal management and operation of Gemini."

Grains determine the disk vertical structure, disk evolution rate, and dominant planet formation mechanism. The PI and her team will incorporate dust settling and grain growth into a time-evolving protostellar disk model and use the model to test three hypotheses relating to the influence of dust on planet formation. First, grain growth and settling, by lowering the scale height of the protostellar disk, may restrict planets forming by core accretion to sub-Jupiter masses. Second, grain growth and settling may trigger gravitational instability in a disk that was previously stable by increasing the disk's transparency to its own radiation. Third, olivine grain opacity increases with iron abundance and decreases with magnesium abundance in the mid-infrared, where the disk radiates heat generated by viscous turbulence. The dominant planet formation mechanism may depend on the [Mg/Fe] ratio of the star-disk material.<br/><br/>The PI will translate her research on planet formation into educational enrichment for first-year college students by starting the New Orbits program, a cohort of 20 students each year who will form a learning community centered on planetary science. The New Orbits program is designed to help incoming students feel confident in their ability to pursue a career in science. New Orbits students will attend a weekly seminar with the PI and take astronomy and geology classes together each semester to fulfill their general science requirement while learning the basics of planetary science. The capstone of the New Orbits program will be a yearly field trip to McDonald Observatory to learn about historic and ongoing planetary research at the 82 inch telescope."

Total solar eclipse crossings of the United States are extremely rare events; the last time a total solar eclipse crossed the Continental U.S. from coast to coast was June 18, 1918.  Eclipses offer a unique scientific opportunity to study the corona of the Sun.  The corona is the outer atmosphere of the Sun, which although very hot (3-4 million degrees F), is very faint when compared to the light from the solar disk.  During a total solar eclipse the moon blocks the light from the solar disk allowing scientists to study this tenuous corona where many of the phenomena collectively known as space weather are generated.  This project will observe the 2017 eclipse from three different vantage points separated by hundreds of miles in order to minimize the risks due to weather and to maximize the potential science.  The project involves the training of students and the PI has a proven track record of reaching out to the public regarding eclipse science.  <br/><br/>This project will take advantage of this total solar eclipse to perform spectral line observations of the solar corona from its base out to a distance of 8 solar radii.  This lower region of the solar corona is inaccessible to current ground and space-based facilities. The project will explore the physical properties of the coronal plasma in the source regions of the solar wind and potentially study any coronal mass ejections that might occur during the observations.  To perform the observations the PI will use three identically instrumented telescope sites separated by hundreds of miles to observe the eclipse.  The telescopes will be equipped with triple-channel imaging spectrometers with channels centered on coronal emission lines of Fe X 637.4 nm, FE XI 789.2 nm and Fe XIV 530.3 nm with a bandpass of 70 nm for each channel.  This will provide information on the continuum light and line emission from elements like Iron (Fe), Argon (Ar) and Nickel (Ni).  These will be the first ever observations of the spectral lines of Ar X, Ar XI, Ar XIII, Fe XV, Ni XIII and Ni XV.  The project also offers a unique opportunity of education and outreach that will have lasting effects on STEM education well beyond the 2017 event.  Students from PI's institution will be engaged in solar physics and astronomy research and education.  The project will, thus, serve to inspire and train the next generation of astronomers.  In addition the PI has been an outspoken advocate for solar physics and eclipse science."

Technical challenges with interferometry are large, as the light must be brought together in instrumentation that is extremely stable mechanically, on the scale of optical wavelengths.  A scientific target of continuing promise for optical interferometry is the study of stars, and stellar surfaces in particular, the subject of this project.<br/><br/>This project will conduct a set of upgrades to the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) that will ultimately enable an increase in the number of resolution elements on the surface of a star by a factor of 10-20 or more over existing instruments, and will furthermore allow the production of stellar images with time resolution of a few days.

Using modern instruments on each telescope, astronomers are able to study everything from asteroids, comets and nearby planets, to huge super-bright stars and distant galaxies.  Plans are now under way at Gemini to prepare each telescope for a new decade of discovery. Astrophysics in the 2020s will be revolutionized by ""Multi-Messenger Astronomy"", an exciting new field that uses gravitational waves and high-energy particles, as well as ordinary everyday light, to study some of the most exotic objects and explosive events in the Universe. Facilities like NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the NSF/University of Wisconsin IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory, and NSF's latest telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will detect these ""messengers"", changing the way we study the Universe. In support of these remarkable new observatories, Gemini will develop new computer software and new optics hardware so that astronomers can study each new discovery quickly and in high detail. In addition to making remarkable discoveries and doing amazing science, Gemini is also a leader in education, public information and outreach activities. Gemini staff bring science to the communities in both Hawai'i and Chile through unique programs such as Journey through the Universe, AstroDay, and Viaje al Universo. With this new award they will extend their reach by developing a Planetarium show that will help the public better understand Multi-Messenger Astronomy.

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>Active wireless systems (which transmit and receive RF signals) such as cellular wireless communications have generated numerous advancements in our society and tremendous impacts on the national economy. Passive wireless systems (which only receive usually very faint signals) such as radio astronomy and earth exploration remote sensing have provided economically and scientifically important observations of Earth's environment, our solar system and the cosmos (e.g., weather forecasting, observation of solar flares which could affect infrastructure and lives on Earth). Both types of systems play crucial roles for the growth of humanity, thus their advancements need to be accommodated. However, their spectrum requirements are growing and conflicting to a large degree, and radio frequency interference (RFI) from active systems to passive systems is an increasing concern. This calls for a new paradigm of spectrum access and sharing that can cope with the future's needs. This project proposes such a paradigm between cellular wireless communications (CWC) and radio astronomy systems (RAS). <br/><br/>The project develops a novel time and frequency division spectrum access between CWC and RAS, which not only resolves the spectrum requirement conflict but also enhances spectrum access opportunities for both systems. Instead of relying on the geographical isolation of RAS telescopes to avoid RFI, the project introduces a geographical coexistence paradigm between CWC and RAS through the use of a large number of distributed auxiliary radio telescopes (DARTs). The very large scale DARTs will suppress the RFI issue and potentially enable a quantum leap in RAS's capabilities. In addition, the project develops novel adaptive circuitry and signal processing algorithms to handle the RFI issue efficiently. In brief, this project develops an interdisciplinary and mutually-beneficial technical solution and framework for spectrum access of CWC and RAS through coordination between them. CWC could gain more spectrum access opportunities which will enable more wireless services/applications and new business opportunities, thus expanding and enriching the national economy. RAS will secure more spectrum access opportunities and enhanced astronomical observation capabilities, thus accelerating its contributions to the fundamental science, knowledge of the universe, and protection of lives on Earth through space environmental information."

Star cluster formation is one of the most fundamental processes in galaxies, and occurs over an incredibly diverse range of environments and physical conditions, far broader than those found in the Milky Way alone.  Clusters are born in the dense parts of giant clouds of molecular gas, and many are subsequently dispersed by several different physical processes.  The goal of this program is to shed light on two as-yet poorly understood epochs in the life cycle of a star cluster -- just before they are born and very soon after they form.  Observations with the National Science Foundation's new Atacama Large Millimeter Array enable direct study of clouds in distant galaxies covering a much wider range of physical conditions than our nearest neighbors.  The properties of these clouds, particularly their mass functions, when compared with those of young star clusters in the same galaxy, provide important clues to understand the efficiency with which stars and clusters form under different physical conditions.  Even as clusters are forming within molecular clouds, the energy and momentum injected by newly born massive stars pushes out left-over interstellar material, which eventually shuts off star formation and leaves many young clusters gravitationally unbound.  Physical constraints on this process are poor, but measurements of the ionized gas both inside and outside of very young clusters using observations with the newly commissioned Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) will distinguish between different predictions."

This project will develop computer software employing a new numerical method to perform the calculations modeling the formation of these clusters of stars.  This new computer software will enable better computer modeling of the astrophysics governing a variety of physical applications.  It will also be the first such software to be made publicly available.  The investigators will then use this software to create computer simulations that model the formation of globular star clusters, and they specifically seek to understand the apparent creation of multiple generations of stars in these globular clusters.  This project's goals will advance the national interests of developing US leadership in physics and enhancing the US cyber infrastructure.  In addition, the investigators will address the national underrepresentation of minorities in the sciences by funding a graduate student to participate in Columbia University's Bridge to the PhD in the Natural Sciences program.  The investigators will train the student in the research program and will mentor the student through the early stages of his or her science career.<br/><br/>More technically, the first part of this project lays out a systematic plan to develop a new open source moving-mesh code.  Recent development of the moving-mesh method as a viable alternative to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement is a promising development.  Moving-mesh hydrodynamics brings many desirable features including low-diffusion in bulk flows, Galilean invariance, and good shock handling.  The software development uses modern design and coding techniques to produce an efficient, parallel code that will be capable of using a wide range of physics and that is easy to use and modify.  It will use the widely used Python language combined with Cython (a static Python compiler) in computationally intensive parts.  Coding will be modular and designed to allow easy and flexible extension to all parts of the code.  The second part of this project is to simulate the formation of globular clusters.  The code will be applied to a three-part plan for understanding globular cluster formation:  (1) modeling the fragmentation and collapse of idealized low-metallicity gas clouds to understand the relative importance of global collapse and fragmentation; (2) using cosmological simulations to identify the physical properties of gas undergoing rapid colliding flows, a prerequisite to bring together a large amount of gas in a small region for GC formation; and (3) exploring the ability of gas outflows from the proposed sources of enriched material to be re-incorporated into a second generation of stars."

These light echoes provide a unique opportunity in astronomy: direct observation of the cause (the explosion) as well as the effect (the expanded remnant) of the same astronomical event.  Because the light echoes come from many directions around the supernovae, a 3D model of the event can be constructed.<br/><br/>The investigators plan public outreach talks, video summaries of their research and citizen science opportunities for the public.  The light echoes are novel events and are naturally great introductions to the history of astronomy, light travel time, SN explosion physics, and the advantage of spectroscopy compared to historical brightness measurements.  They are developing interactive learning materials available for introductory undergraduates. They have an exciting Citizen Science plan, which enables the public to learn the scientific process by identifying new light echoes in their observations.<br/><br/>The 3D model is valuable because modern theoretical work suggests that asymmetry may be a critical ingredient in the SN explosion mechanism. The investigators will expand their program to regularly observe 6 historical SN events.  They will observe with the NSF?s Blanco telescope, a large telescope, with a 4-meter aperture size. The 3-degree square field of view, combined with the fast 20 second readout of DECam, this the ideal telescope for this search. Since their targets are generally older than already detected supernovae, they expect the targets to be slightly fainter.  They will produce many 5 minute duration images a night.  They will use computers programmed for machine learning to identify echoes.  They will compare their machine learning results with Citizen Science analysis of the same images.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All galaxies appear to be surrounded by large halos of dark matter.  And dark matter dominates the gravitational field of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter is dark because it does not emit or absorb light making it hard to study.  In fact, astronomers do not yet know the true nature of dark matter.  But understanding this will advance our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.<br/><br/>By studying the dark matter halos of galaxies, and how their gravity bends light from more distant sources (gravity lenses), astronomers can learn about the structure of the dark matter in the halos how they were formed.  Various models to explain these things have been developed, and they can all be tested based on what actually happens in dark matter halos.  This proposed study will use high-resolution images of gravity lenses to learn more about the structure of the dark-matter halos.  The results will also help determine the type of particle dark matter is.<br/><br/>The PI's institution serves students from underrepresented and/or underprivileged backgrounds.  The Broader Impact part of this project will be to award promising undergraduate science and engineering majors (a minimum of six students over three years) a stipend to do research (allowing them to focus on studies and research rather than work part time jobs outside of school). The undergraduates will learn skills, and gain experiences, that are vital to STEM fields, while also producing valuable results for this project.  Each year, students accepted to the program will work at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) during the summer.  They will participate in a three-day workshop to acquire scientific computing skills, attend weekly meetings to discuss recent papers in astrophysics, and at the end of the summer will give a talk on their research at the AMNH ""Physical Sciences REU Symposium"". Finally, after the following fall semester the students will have the opportunity to attend and give a poster presentation of their research at the winter American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting.<br/><br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/>The existence of small dark matter substructure in galaxies is a key prediction of dark matter theories that remains largely untested.  The project's goals are to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm by analyzing a sample of gravitational lenses observed at high resolution. The proposed project will evaluate methods to detect and characterize substructure in gravitational lens galaxies.  In particular it will consist of observing lenses in the submillimeter electromagnetic spectral range.  Galaxies with gravitational lenses are being discovered rapidly in this area.  Using high-resolution observations (e.g. by the ALMA telescope array) of these galaxies, the PI and team will obtain unprecedented information on the dark matter distribution in galaxies. And because gravitational lensing directly exhibits the warping of space time by dark matter, a study of gravitational lens systems is a promising method to constrain generic particle properties of dark matter (independent of specific particle models). The team's primary goal is to show how this information can be used to constrain the detailed properties of dark matter substructure as a way of identifying the nature of dark matter itself."

Dust reduces the light from galaxies, sends out its own light, and plays an important role in the thermo-, chemo-, and fluid-dynamics of the matter between the star systems in a galaxy, and in the formation of planets and stars. An improved understanding of the physical properties of interstellar dust grains will have implications for studies of diverse astrophysical phenomena, from formation of stars and planets to the material near active galactic nuclei.<br/><br/>Our knowledge of interstellar dust derives primarily from remote observations of absorption, scattering, and emission of electromagnetic radiation by dust grains. The scattering and absorption properties of dust grains are needed to interpret observations, and to test dust models. In addition, scattering and absorption of light exerts forces and torques on dust grains, with important dynamical consequences. Dr. Bruce Draine and his research team will carry out a number of investigations concerning the optical properties of interstellar dust, and development of improved tools for calculating the optical properties of small particles with irregular geometries. These tools will be used to find new state-of-the-art models (composition, shape, and size distribution) for interstellar dust that are consistent with observational constraints.<br/><br/>The initial objective is to create a ""library"" of calculated cross sections for scattering and absorption over a broad range of wavelengths, for selected grain sizes, shapes, and compositions. Grain geometries will include spheroids, fluffy grains built up from random coagulation of spheres, and grains that are irregular but compact. State-of-the-art codes will be employed. The discrete dipole approximation (DDA) will be used for irregular grain geometries. Accurate calculations of absorption and differential scattering cross sections at X-ray energies will be carried out using a new code applying anomalous diffraction theory to general geometries. This code will be documented and made publicly-available (open source) on the WWW. Dr. Draine will continue to develop and support the open-source code DDSCAT for calculations using the DDA. The cross-section library will be made available on the WWW. For each grain, the team will calculate the temperature distribution function for various heating radiation fields; the library of temperature distribution functions will also be made available on the WWW. These will be valuable community resources.<br/><br/>The calculated cross-sections and temperature distribution functions will be used to construct the best-to-date interstellar dust models with size distributions adjusted to reproduce observations of wavelength-dependent extinction, wavelength-dependent polarization of starlight, polarized infrared emission, and X-ray scattering. Models will be built with different grain shapes, including compact grains and fluffy grains. Interstellar grains may include magnetic material. The team will continue study of the intensity and polarization of the magnetic dipole radiation emitted by such grains. This magnetic dipole radiation may be important at mm and cm wavelengths, contributing a new polarized component to the ""galactic foreground"", affecting studies of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.<br/><br/>This work has broad interdisciplinary impact. Improved methods for calculating scattering and absorption by nanostructures have wide applicability, beyond astrophysics. The optics of small particles is important in many scientific fields, including atmospheric science, oceanography, planetary science, combustion science, marine biology, and nanoparticle studies. DDSCAT has already been applied by users in all of these areas. The DDSCAT package will continue to be supported by Dr. Draine and made publicly available via the WWW. The research program includes a graduate student component, and undergraduate participation is planned. The proposed research will thereby contribute to training future scientists."

The smallest stars lack this boundary, but they can still have strong magnetic fields.  Weber will develop computer models of magnetic activity in M dwarf stars, the smallest, most common stars in our galaxy.  Results from her work will allow astronomers to understand how magnetism emerges in M dwarfs.  Because many M dwarfs host planets, this work might also allow a better understanding of how stellar magnetic activity affects the conditions for life on such planets.  Alongside this research, Weber will present colorful visualizations of her computer models, showing Adler Planetarium visitors how heat and magnetism are created inside a star and how they reach the stellar surface and beyond.  Weber will also develop a science communication program for University of Chicago students.<br/>     <br/>Weber will study the generation and emergence of magnetism in fully convective M dwarfs and in those with an imposed tachocline.   She will produce the first set of simulations that address dynamo action and the rotation-activity correlation for M dwarfs across the partially-to-fully convective transition. The nature of the magnetism generated will inform separate simulations of flux emergence and allow astronomers to interpret observations of M dwarf magnetic activity.  Her work will assess whether buoyant magnetic structures emerge self-consistently in these stars, as they are in rapidly rotating Sun-like stars.  Comparing such structures with those studied through traditional flux emergence models will allow a better understanding of the flux pattern expected at the stellar surface.

These are the biggest star clusters known, with millions of stars in a small region.  The clusters are fossils of the time early in the history of our universe when stars formed far more often than they do today. The chemical elements that form our planet, and all living beings, were formed during the lives and deaths of such ancient stars.  <br/><br/>The stars in smaller star clusters are observed to all have almost the same abundances of elements.  However, this is not true for globular clusters, which have a spread in abundances.  This could give an important clue to how they formed. In the end this will help us to understand our own origins.<br/><br/>The investigators will test their new model for how the clusters formed: not as one large cluster, but rather as many smaller clusters that then fell together.  Each of the little clusters had its own uniform abundances of elements. When they fell together to make a big cluster, it was a mixture of all the little clusters, so it had a spread of abundances. Observations of globular clusters have recently demonstrated the presence of multiple or spread main sequence populations with varying elemental abundances in virtually every object examined with sufficient care. This is in distinct contrast to less massive open clusters and even observed young massive clusters, which have comparatively uniform elemental abundances. Multiple proposed explanations, which rely on time variability in the star formation rate, contradict current observations.<br/><br/>The investigators are developing software tools to model the spread in abundances. These models will run on NSF supercomputers. They will model the gas from which the stars form, and the stars themselves, in separate programs coupled together at every time step. They are building in an adaptive mesh program to model the gas. This innovative method will have many other applications in science and engineering. <br/><br/>Their work has broader impacts in the following areas. In education, it will directly support research by a graduate student, and three undergraduates participating in Drexel's exemplary cooperative education program.

The energy released is enormous, and the effect on galactic evolution profound, but no such event has ever been identified because the overwhelming majority of the energy is released in gravitational waves, which are as yet undetectable.  This project will characterize the visible light signals that should be given off by nearby gas under the influence of the event, using complex numerical simulations.  Training in these techniques will be of great value for the future activities of the junior researchers on the team.<br/><br/>Although there should be sufficient gas close enough to the merger events to give off visible radiation, the character of any emitted signals is unknown.  Particular questions include in which band most of the light will emerge, what is its spectrum, and how does the radiated power vary in time? This work will start to answer these questions.  The extremely complex interaction between the surrounding gas and a pair of black holes bound to one another involves strongly nonlinear physics, including magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, shocks, and dynamical spacetimes, which can only be tackled numerically.  This requires carefully structured simulations using radiation transfer post-processing to predict key observable features, using the team's new infrastructure that supports consistent MHD calculations on separate grids and across qualitatively different spacetimes.  Calculations with astrophysically plausible parameters should identify unique photon signals for observers to locate black holes on their way to merger.<br/><br/>This computational system should also be useful to many other astrophysical simulations.  The work will train a number of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the techniques of large-scale numerical simulation, skills that are valuable far beyond the confines of astrophysical research.

It was referenced in 2010 State of the Union and later on the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (More than 1/3 of the bill deals with radio spectrum), the PCAST 2012 Report [President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] (which calls for vastly increased use of spectrum sharing) and the 2013 Presidential memo (Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation). The aim of this program is to identify bold new concepts with the potential to contribute to significant improvements in the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization, protection of passive sensing services, and in the ability for traditionally underserved Americans to benefit from current and future wireless-enabled goods and services. The impact is large on the economics of the Nation as seen on the last FCC bidding of 65MHz of the spectrum for over $45 billion early in 2015. It will enable access to science, engineering, industry, civilian and military users of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.<br/><br/>The staggering growth of wireless communications systems has led to an increasing demand for spectrum to support commercial services, particularly in the frequencies below 3 GHz, where battery-powered mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets operate most efficiently. It is desirable for such devices to be useful for a variety of applications, and in a variety of locations that have differing available spectrum. Currently this is achieved, in a smart phone for example, by a collection of hardware solutions, with one for each standard. This is complex and expensive, and such receivers will not be sufficiently adaptable for future spectrum usage. It is desirable to have a single hardware solution that is capable of receiving a broad spectrum and then selecting a particular transmission from it a based on the local spectral conditions and the application. Adaptable solutions such as this do not currently exist due in large part to the interference that occurs when a desired signal is weak and is crowded by a channel containing a high power signal.  There are high dynamic range receivers that tolerate such disparate signal levels, but they are not adaptable over large bandwidths.  In this project, a novel high-dynamic range receiver topology that promises to enable the reception of a wide instantaneous bandwidth will be explored.  The topology is enabled by new signal processing concepts and integrated circuit technologies. The research undertaken will range from the basic theory to experimental demonstration."

This project serves the national interest as it expands our understanding of the science behind the formation of planetary systems around other stars.  A graduate student, a postdoc, and at least three undergraduate students will participate in this study.  The investigators will also participate in a K-12 teacher workshop at The University of Arizona, reaching Hispanic and Native American communities.

They will also measure wind mass loss rates through the main stages of disk evolution and dispersal. They will extend their analysis of the [OI] lines to a sample of more evolved disks, including more disks with dust cavities, and analyze one of the blue [SII] transitions to clarify the thermal contribution to the [OI] emission."

Despite a wealth of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum over the last four decades, much of what happens in their deep interior remains inscrutable.  Owing to X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, laboratory nuclear experiments, and perhaps in the near future gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), knowledge of neutron star physics is growing rapidly.  Indeed, the National Academy report, ""Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century"" identified the nature of matter at exceedingly high density and temperature as one of the eleven critical science questions for the twenty-first century.  Moreover, the recent 2010 Decadal Survey ""New Worlds, New Horizons"" identifies as one of its Frontier questions for Stars and Stellar Evolution, ""What controls the mass, radius, and spin of compact stellar remnants?""  The models developed in this project will enable existing and future observations to further our knowledge of the physics of dense matter and stellar evolution.<br/><br/>This project includes activities to recruit the next generation of scientists and to inform the public and provides support of a graduate student for three years.  The project supports an undergraduate to assist with running the codes used in the project, and to assist with testing, maintaining, and posting educational resources using the open-source MESA stellar evolution code.  The PI with assistance from the undergraduate will develop problem sets, plots, and animations using MESA.  Michigan State is a large public institution with a diverse student population and will serve as a testbed for development of these resources.  In particular, the PI will develop problem ""templates"" so that students can more readily use MESA to explore stellar physics.  These tools will be posted on the MESA web forum http://mesastar.org/.  Posting these tools will make it easier for other instructors to adopt MESA for classroom instruction and is expected to motivate others to post their results as well.  For public outreach, the PI will incorporate discoveries made during the tenure of this award into public talks at Michigan State's Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>More technically, for neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the neutron star accretes hydrogen- or helium-rich material, there is a wealth of time-dependent phenomena spanning a wide range of timescales.  During accretion, runaway thermonuclear burning of the accreted matter is observable as a Type I X-ray burst.  The thousands of observed X-ray bursts, the rarer and more energetic superbursts, and the cooling transients all encode information about the physics of dense matter, in particular the sub-nuclear-density ""crust"" of the neutron star.  For over a decade the model of the neutron star's crust has been that the three layers influence each other: the short bursts produce the fuel for superbursts, superburst ashes form the outer crust, and nuclear reactions in the crust heat the envelope.  In the last several years, however, evidence has steadily mounted that this picture is at best incomplete, and that additional, strong, shallow---and as yet unidentified---heat sources are present.  This project will generate global models of the neutron star crust with the latest nuclear reaction physics, including a newly discovered neutrino cooling mechanism, and use existing and future observations of cooling transients, superbursts, and X-ray bursts to constrain the depth and strength of additional heating in the crust.  In addition, they will make predictions for the uniqueness of the crust composition as a function of density, which is important for determining the neutron star's thermal and magnetic evolution as well as its ability to sustain a mass quadrupole."

Using observations of the collection of star clusters, and their motions around Centaurus A, the investigators will measure the dark matter density profile of the galaxy, and search for remnants of smaller galaxies that have merged with Centaurus A.  The important goal of their observations is identifying large star clusters which are the remnants left over from smaller galaxies after they have been devoured by the larger Centaurus A.

By combining the star cluster kinematics with an already existing red giant branch star map, the visible, accreted substructures will be identified and weighed.  Finally, a complete sample of ultra-compact dwarfs will be analyzed, including a search identifying them as the central compact remnants of stripped dwarf galaxies.

The Milky Way has dozens of smaller dwarf galaxies in orbit around it.  These dwarf galaxies are being ripped apart by our galaxy's gravity into long streams of stars. Some of these streams encircle the entire galaxy.  The investigator recently discovered that the disk of the Milky Way, which includes the spiral structure, has previously unknown 'ripples'.  These ripples are believed to form when smaller dwarf galaxies fall into the Milky Way, just as a pebble dropped into a pond produces ripples on the surface of the water.  By mapping the density of stars throughout the Milky Way, this project model of the interaction between the Milky Way galaxy and the dwarf galaxies orbiting it.  These models will help us understand where dark matter is located.  The models also teach us how the spiral arms of galaxies are made and sustained.  <br/><br/>This project will train undergraduate students in science and computing.  The investigator will engage the public in the scientific process through sustained public outreach initiatives.  Public outreach will include science web pages, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube videos, Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions, opportunities to observe the sky through small telescopes, and hands-on outreach activities that will reach thousands of children, teens, adults, and seniors.  A relationship will be maintained between the investigators and the ~20,000 people, at any given time, who volunteer their personal computers to create the MilkyWay@home supercomputer.<br/><br/>The investigator will map the three dimensional stellar density in the disk and halo of our galaxy, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sequence and turnoff stars in the galaxy's halo.  The investigator will use the technique of statistical photometric parallax to make the density maps. This technique recovers the underlying density distribution without measuring the distance to each individual star, because only the intrinsic brightness distribution is required.<br/><br/>The outer disk and the stellar halo will be mapped with turnoff stars. Main sequence stars, which are intrinsically dimmer, will be used to trace the density of closer stars in the Milky Way disk.

Thousands of these Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) arrive at Earth each day, but their nature remains a mystery. The biggest obstacle has been the low spatial resolution of the radio telescopes that have discovered FRBs to date, which has been insufficient to accurately pinpoint the distant host galaxies from which they originate. The Deep Synoptic Array (DSA) is a new radio telescope, designed to tackle the FRB problem head on by detecting 100 FRBs each year, and localizing each burst to its host galaxy. As well as solving the mystery of the origin of FRBs, these events can be used to provide a powerful probe of the intergalactic medium, the ionized gas occupying the space between galaxies. Immediately after detection of each FRB, an alert will be shared with the entire astronomical community. Students, ranging from K-12 through undergraduate and graduate level, will be involved in designing, building and operating the DSA, as well as participating in delivery of science, seeding the next generation of radio astronomers in the US.<br/><br/>The DSA will be a radio interferometer purpose-built for FRB detection and direct localization. It will be located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), heavily leveraging existing infrastructure to minimize both cost and deployment timescale. The array will consist of 110 x 5m dishes spanning an area of diameter 2.25 km, and will continuously survey for FRBs at frequencies between 1280 - 1530 MHz.  The use of low-cost antennas outfitted with custom-designed receivers and a novel digital back-end will deliver a sample of >300 FRBs localized to < 3-arcsecond regions within a 3-year science program. FRB alerts will be issued via the VOEvent service to the entire astronomical community to ensure rapid follow-up of DSA-localized FRBs. The project will enable transformational advances in our understanding of the origins of FRBs, and of the unseen baryons in the circumgalactic medium and intergalactic medium. The low-cost implementation of the DSA technology will also offer a framework for the US community to develop a future facility for mapping the radio sky with unmatched survey speed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These high-mass stars output enormous amounts of energy and live only for a few million years before ending their life as a supernova. A major challenge in astrophysics is to understand how these stars are formed. The investigators will use the National Science Foundation's large radio telescopes to observe young high-mass stars, which are still growing as surrounding matter falls onto them. During this process some of the matter is expelled in the form of jets and outflows of hot gas. To make progress in our scientific understanding of high-mass star formation, the next step is understanding the flow of material near these stars. A systematic study of outflows and jets is thus urgently needed. With these radio telescopes, the investigators will chart the flow of matter near these stars. Specifically, the investigators will make new observations every few months and map the motion of the clumps of material over time. The project is a collaboration between a primarily Hispanic serving university in New Mexico and a primarily undergraduate institution in rural Illinois. Student involvement in the planned observations provide hands-on STEM education on a variety of educational levels. Students will also take part in institutional interchanges and public outreach activities lead by the principal investigators. This project will thereby promote the participation of women and minorities in science.<br/><br/>Ionized jets and molecular outflows are commonly present in high-mass proto-stars. This project will carry out a multiscale observational study which addresses fundamental unanswered questions on the physics of the mass outflows. The goals of the project are 1) to connect the ionized jets to the large scale molecular flows with high quality measurements of the momentum rates, 2) to directly measure the ionized jet motion via proper motion and spectral line observations, and 3) to use water and methanol maser observations to study the jet launching mechanism, as well as the momentum transfer between ionized and molecular gas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The extremely complex interaction between the surrounding gas and a pair of black holes bound to one another involves strongly nonlinear physics, including magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, shocks, and dynamical spacetimes, which can only be tackled numerically.  This requires carefully structured simulations using radiation transfer post-processing to predict key observable features, using the team's new infrastructure that supports consistent MHD calculations on separate grids and across qualitatively different spacetimes.  Calculations with astrophysically plausible parameters should identify unique photon signals for observers to locate black holes on their way to merger.<br/><br/>This computational system should also be useful to many other astrophysical simulations.

These are the biggest star clusters known, with millions of stars in a small region.  The clusters are fossils of the time early in the history of our universe when stars formed far more often than they do today. The chemical elements that form our planet, and all living beings, were formed during the lives and deaths of such ancient stars.  <br/><br/>The stars in smaller star clusters are observed to all have almost the same abundances of elements.  However, this is not true for globular clusters, which have a spread in abundances.  This could give an important clue to how they formed. In the end this will help us to understand our own origins.<br/><br/>The investigators will test their new model for how the clusters formed: not as one large cluster, but rather as many smaller clusters that then fell together.  Each of the little clusters had its own uniform abundances of elements. When they fell together to make a big cluster, it was a mixture of all the little clusters, so it had a spread of abundances. Observations of globular clusters have recently demonstrated the presence of multiple or spread main sequence populations with varying elemental abundances in virtually every object examined with sufficient care. This is in distinct contrast to less massive open clusters and even observed young massive clusters, which have comparatively uniform elemental abundances. Multiple proposed explanations, which rely on time variability in the star formation rate, contradict current observations.<br/><br/>The investigators are developing software tools to model the spread in abundances. These models will run on NSF supercomputers. They will model the gas from which the stars form, and the stars themselves, in separate programs coupled together at every time step.

The telescope will begin gathering light in 2019, and begin a full survey of the visible sky two years later.  The survey will discover billions of new astronomical objects, including hundreds of new galaxies nearby to our own Milky Way galaxy.  The new galaxies that we will discover are so faint that they could not be found by previous telescopes.  These tiny galaxies are also ideal places to test fundamental questions about the origin of galaxies in our Universe.  This research focuses on the fact that these tiny galaxies are very sensitive to the first stars that formed in our Universe.  This fact has not been sufficiently explored in previous research.  To prepare astronomers to understand what these galaxies tell us about the origins of our Universe, this research focuses on three key areas.  First, they will predict the number of faint galaxies that the National Science Foundation's LSST should discover.  Second, they will predict how far away from the Milky Way the LSST might find the faint galaxies.  Third, they will predict whether any of these galaxies is still forming stars today, or whether they all stopped forming stars billions of years ago. The research advances the scientific leadership of the United States and help to safeguard the United States' investment in LSST.  The project focuses on training students who are first-generation college students, with the goal of diversifying the US technical workforce.  An expanded and diversified scientific workforce helps to ensure that the US remains a leader in innovation and economic growth.<br/><br/>The LSST will revolutionize our knowledge of dwarf galaxies, especially in the ultra-faint regime.  However, simulators have barely begun to extend their successful models to stellar masses below 1 million solar masses.  Now is the critical time to understand whether our current simulations can continue to explain galaxy formation down into the ultra-faint range, or whether a new understanding of star formation in low mass dark matter halos will be required. The goal of this work is to gain substantial knowledge about the processes that control early star formation in dwarf galaxies and subsequent quenching. The number of observed galaxies with stellar masses below 10 thousand solar masses depends strongly on the density of gas from which the first stars could form in the early Universe. The proposed work will generate hundreds of simulated dwarf galaxies, with stellar masses ranging from one billion solar masses (roughly 1/10 the mass of the Milky Way) down to 1000 solar masses in the range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.  This work utilizes the simulations to (1) pinpoint the role of star formation density threshold on the number of galaxies that form, and the resulting stellar mass function; (2) make predictions for the number of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as function of radius from the Milky Way; (3) study the processes that quench dwarf galaxies as function of mass and environment, and make predictions for the quenched fraction in the field that can be observed by future facilities.  This work also establishes a program to support and mentor first-generation college students (many of whom are likely to also be from groups historically underrepresented in STEM) as they transition to being undergraduates. The program will (1) develop a mentoring relationship between students and members of the Rutgers Physics & Astronomy department, (2) utilize cohort building activities to develop the students into a peer support network for each other, (3) introduce the students to basic research tools and get them involved in original research. These three goals have been shown to increase the retention of underrepresented students in science. The overall aim is to improve the demographic diversity of both the Rutgers Physics & Astronomy undergraduate majors, but also of the Physics and Astronomy community. This program will also train graduate students to teach and mentor the first-year students, and educate the graduate student mentors on issues of equity and barriers to education that first-year/underrepresented students face.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The gas motions can tell us about the collisions and how these largest structures in the universe form. Space X-ray telescopes are limited in their abilities to trace these motions, especially outside the denser cluster centers. As it turns out, however, galaxies scattered throughout clusters spew out streams of highly energetic particles that emit radio waves visible from the earth that reveal their interactions with the intracluster media. The intracluster gas motions can also energize radio emitting particles, illuminating the motions. The investigators will find these radio emissions and map their details, using both new and existing ground based radio telescope observations and utilizing the citizen-science-based ""Radio Galaxy Zoo."" In addition, they will compute detailed physical models to determine how these emissions can be used to trace out the motions of the intracluster media as well as their origins and histories.  The results of these studies will substantially improve our understanding of how galaxy clusters form.<br/><br/><br/>Galaxy clusters are the largest known gravitationally bound systems in the universe. They are filled with 'intracluster media,"" diffuse plasmas with temperatures of 10s of millions of degrees, which are visible from space using X-rays.  The investigators will address three key questions about these media:  1) what is the dynamical state of the gas, its flows, turbulence and shocks? 2) how do these dynamical features help us understand the cluster formation process? and 3) how do we reliably connect the underlying motions with what we can observe?   The investigators will specifically concentrate on behaviors observable at radio wavelengths, using emission from electrons moving at relativistic speeds in the presence of a magnetic field.  This allows them to study regimes such as cluster outskirts, for which very little X-ray information is available.  They will carry out numerical simulations at the technical frontier, coupling the magnetohydrodynamics of the hot gas to the relativistic particles generating the radio emission. They will conduct new state-of-the-art radio telescope observations and analyses, along with information from the citizen science project Radio Galaxy Zoo on distortions of radio-emitting plasmas caused by the hot gas flows.   Together, this work will enable the investigators to gain important information about the cluster formation process, a key piece in the universal picture of how structures in the universe develop over billions of years."

It is from these disks that planets, like Earth and the other planets in our Solar System, are formed.  There is now strong evidence that most, if not all, stars in our Galaxy have their own system of planets.  The team at the University of Virginia will use sophisticated computer code that they have been working with for many years to study this process.  They will include the effects of ""magnetic fields"" and ""turbulence"" in their models.  Both are thought to be important processes in space, especially in the large clouds that we know lie between the stars.  These clouds collapse under their own weight to form stars and planets.  A graduate and an undergraduate student will be involved in this project.  The investigators will produce animated movies of disk formation for use in large introductory astronomy classes for non-science majors and will develop activities for a mobile planetarium as part of the ""Dark Skies, Bright Kids"" program, a science educational activity that targets elementary school students in rural Albemarle County, Virginia.<br/><br/>Star-forming cores are observed to be significantly magnetized and magnetic braking has been shown to be capable of suppressing disk formation, leading to the so-called magnetic braking catastrophe. The goal of the proposed program is to determine whether the two leading candidates for averting the catastrophe, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects and turbulence, can allow the planet-forming disks to form in the presence of a realistic magnetic field, and whether such disks satisfy the increasingly tight observational constraints set by recent ALMA observations.  The proposers will use and further develop a well-tested MHD code known as ZeusTW.  In the second part of the project they will use the ENZO adaptive mesh refinement MHD code to synthesize disk formation in isolated cores and in clusters."

Volcanic activity on Io helps to maintain a tenuous atmosphere that consists of neutral and ionized gas. The ionized component of Io's atmosphere interacts strongly with Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. This interaction causes some of the gas from Io's atmosphere to be transferred to Jupiter's magnetosphere.  This research project will study how the volcanic output of Io affects Jupiter's magnetosphere.  Results from the study will shed light on the physical processes that control mass transfer between planets and their satellites; and on planetary magnetospheres in general.  The project will also support a teacher training workshop that broadens participation in science by reaching elementary and middle school science teachers in low-income and underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>This research project will study variations in Io's volcanic output to identify the mechanisms that drive radial transport in Jupiter's magnetosphere.  The research team will use a 35-cm robotically controlled telescope equipped with a coronagraph to record images of sulfur-ion emission in the Io plasma torus (IPT) every fifteen minutes for several months a year for five years.  They will use the same telescope to record coronagraphic images of the Jovian sodium nebula, which is a proxy for Io's volcanic activity.  In addition, they will use the Infrared Red Telescope Facility to periodically conduct infrared observations of the Jovian sodium nebula, which are a more direct proxy of volcanic activity.  The high quality, high temporal resolution, and long duration of the observations would maximize the chance of recording a response of Jupiter's magnetosphere to a large volcanic outburst on Io.  By measuring the temporal relationships between Io's volcanic activity and the IPT, as well as the IPT's overall brightness and east-west extent, the team will be able to distinguish between the two main mechanisms that are thought to drive mass loading and radial transport in Jupiter's magnetosphere.  The project will also provide new content on Io's volcanism and Jupiter's magnetism to a teacher training workshop."

This is a period a few hundred million years after the Big Bang during which all of the atomic Hydrogen gas in the universe was ionized by newly formed massive stars.  These were the first stars to form in the universe.  Understanding this early period is one of the main goals of astrophysics.   This is because properties of the unverse (and the objects causing the ionization) carry implications for models and simulations of how galaxies form and the physics of the matter being ionized (the intergalactic medium or IGM).  <br/><br/>This project will shed new light on reionization and high-redshift galaxies by observing the IGM after the epoch of reionization.  At these times, the IGM contains a large amount of information on when and how reionization occurred. Fortunately, in the past year a set of ""ultra-bright"" quasars have been discovered that are much brighter than previously known quasars at similar distances. The PI and his team will make entirely new or greatly improved measurements of three aspects of the post-reionization IGM: (i) the smoothing of baryons in the IGM due to heating during reionization, (ii) the thermal changes of the IGM due to cool-down following reionization, and (iii) the most sensitive study to date of the enrichment of elements heavier than helium of gas in galaxies from this period.  This latter measurement will aid in the understanding of early-period star formation.<br/><br/>Education efforts supported by this project will reach young children in predominantly Hispanic, low-income communities. The PI and graduate student funded by this grant will help to develop, manage, and perform astronomy-themed workshops designed to promote STEM education in kindergarten, first, and second-grade students. The workshops will address California's Common Core State Standards for science, and target underserved communities in Riverside and surrounding areas. Workshop themes will include Touching the Universe, The Spiral Universe, Constellations Everywhere, and Smells of the Universe.<br/> <br/>This project clearly relates to NSF's mission to promote the progress of science.  In addition, the ""Broader Impact"" portion of the project does this, and advances the national health, prosperity and welfare by helping to develop interest in, and educating, STEM activities among the next generation of diverse individuals.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the epoch of reionization remains one of the forefront goals of astrophysics. Along with being the last global phase change of the Universe, reionization carries key implications for models of galaxy formation and the physics of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Over the past several years, notable advances have been made through observations of high-redshift galaxies, quasars, the cosmic microwave background, and other probes. Currently, however, the combined constraints on when reionization occurred remain relatively weak, with the bulk of observations being consistent with reionization ending either relatively late (z~6-7) or significantly earlier (z~8-9).<br/><br/>Motivated by these new objects, the PI and his team will make entirely new or greatly improved measurements of three aspects of the post-reionization IGM and galaxy-IGM interface: (i) Measuring the Jeans smoothing of the IGM at z~5 will reveal how much energy has been injected at higher redshifts via photo-heating, and hence when reionization occurred (more total heating = earlier reionization). This measurement will constrain the characteristic redshift of reionization to within Deltazreion=+/-0.7, or a factor of two better than current CMB constraints. (ii) Measuring the temperature of the IGM out to the highest redshifts ever (z=5.7) will determine whether the IGM is still warm at that epoch from having recently been reionized. Alternatively, an IGM that has already cooled by z~5.5 will imply that reionization largely occurred at z>7.5. (iii) Finally, the survey for CIV at z~5 will be sensitive to metals down to the cosmic mean density, probing a factor of six more volume than any other direct survey at any redshift. This will reveal, for the first time, the full extent to which reionization-era galaxies enriched their surroundings via galactic winds. Searching for weak O I systems at z~6 also will establish whether the drop in C IV with redshift at z>5 is due to a decline in metallicity or evolution of the UV background."

These ions can exist at the very low temperatures at which most other molecules freeze out.  The research team will use a sophisticated laboratory experiment to accurately determine reaction rates of the ions at very low temperatures.  Results from the study will allow astronomers to better understand the abundance of these ions in space and to use them as probes of the coldest and densest regions within interstellar clouds, which are birthplaces of stars and planets.  The project will contribute to the training and professional development of a postdoctoral scholar.  The project will also support a program that is known to have a positive impact on middle school and high school science education.<br/><br/>The research team will perform laboratory studies of the gas-phase reactions of atomic deuterium with H3+ -- the simplest polyatomic ion found in the interstellar gas -- and its deuterated forms H2D+ and D2H+.  The three reactions are important in the chemistry that drastically increases the deuterium content of interstellar molecules; and the H2D+ and D2H+ ions probe the densest regions of cold dark clouds where most other molecules freeze out.  Understanding the chemistry of these ions is therefore essential to understanding these regions, which are potential sites of star and planet formation.  The proposed studies are challenging because atoms and molecular ions are difficult to produce in the laboratory.  The team will measure rate coefficients of the reactions of D atoms with H3+, H2D+, and D2H+ using a dual-source, merged fast-beams apparatus, which was built with prior NSF support (AST-0905832), that enables them to produce and react beams of atoms and molecular ions.  Collisional cross sections extracted from the measured rate coefficients will be used to generate thermal rate coefficients at temperatures relevant to cold interstellar clouds (10 K - 100 K).  The rate coefficients are expected to be accurate to within 15% -- about an order of magnitude better than those calculated for the three reactions.  The project will support a postdoctoral scholar at Columbia University.  The project will also allow team members to continue participating in the Columbia University Summer Research Program that engages middle school and high school teachers in scientific research, and has been shown to help retain teachers in school and improve student performance in science courses."

These newly discovered planets will be among the best targets for detailed studies that will help us understand our place in our own Milky Way Galaxy. MINERVA's use of four small telescopes is more cost effective than a single telescope with the same effective size.  It is also creates the flexibility to use part of the array to achieve an ambitious education and public outreach program, largely aimed at minority undergraduate students, to which 10% of the observatory's time is dedicated. <br/><br/>It is becoming clear that the number of planets increases rapidly with decreasing planet mass and radius.  Project MINERVA will discover new planets around bright stars by intensely observing a handful of carefully-selected targets with purpose-built instrumentation at a dedicated telescope. It will use four 0.7 meter roboticized commercial telescopes at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona to simultaneously feed a high precision radial velocity spectrograph. The design goal is state-of-the-art (1 m/s) Doppler precision necessary to find low-mass planets, which will be achieved by combining an iodine wavelength reference with a fiber-fed, intrinsically stable spectrograph.  With all of the observing time dedicated to this goal, significant time can be dedicated to each star in order to mitigate the deleterious effects of stellar jitter. Based on simulations of detection limits and planet populations, the team expects to find ~14 new low-mass planets around 80 stars in the eta Earth sample of bright (3.5 < V < 8.5), chromospherically inactive GKM stars. These new planets will be ideal targets for detailed characterization by future ground-based instrumentation and space missions."

It has been shown that these speckles are a major limitation to high-contrast imaging, such as that involved in directly imaging exoplanets. In the proposed formulation, the science camera operates synchronously with the wavefront sensor (WFS), so that the science camera records a speckle pattern that corresponds to the wavefront measured by the WFS. The resulting millisecond exposures provide an information-rich dataset containing a random AO residual, measured by the WFS, that effectively interrogates the optical system and provides new information about the ""non-common path aberrations"", which, when corrected, can significantly improve ultra-high contract astronomical imaging."

The combined bandwidth, linearity and dynamic range requirements of these unoccupied regions exceed that found in state-of-art of radio receivers by several times. Cognitive radio technology has been proposed for such purposes over the last decade; however, its development has run into bottlenecks due to several technological challenges. <br/><br/>This proposal addresses the need for a more efficient coexistence of weak opportunistic secondary user signals with mixed strong/weak primary signals that are currently used for commercial applications, public safety, homeland security, and national defense. This proposal aims at designing and optimizing novel and innovative cognitive multi-channel spectrum sensors, enabling smart and dynamic next-generation wireless communication systems, which will coexist harmonically with other broadband systems over the same frequency bands. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research objectives are: (1) coarse frequency estimation of strong primary signal blockers that interfere with the estimation and detection of weaker primary signals and spectrum holes; (2) strong blocker removal system in the radio frequency (RF) and analog domain to filter out the selected channel for reliable determination of opportunistic communications; (3) novel signal processing techniques based on locally most powerful (LMP) detectors for the estimation and detection of weak primary signals and spectrum holes."

Most stars, especially large ones but also stars like the Sun, form in clusters of thousands of objects.  One of the best-known clusters of young stars is found in the Orion Nebula.  This birthplace for stars can be viewed even with small telescopes.  With large professional telescopes researchers can distinguish the thousands of stars in the cluster, most of which are only a few million years old.  The team from the University of California San Diego will study the Orion cluster in greater detail than ever before.  They will measure the movements of the stars using the Keck Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  By comparing the motions of the stars in Orion with computer models, the awardees will reach a better understanding of how the stars were formed.  While conducting this research, the team will also develop a new, one day, hands-on workshop for the Better Education for Women in Science and Engineering (BE WiSE) program.  BE WiSE works directly with 7-12th grade girls and hopes to encourage more of them to follow careers in the sciences.<br/><br/>The awardees seek to test models of clustered star formation.  They will focus on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), probing stars with masses spanning three orders of magnitude down to the brown dwarf limit.  The team propose to build a three-dimensional kinematic map of the center of the ONC by combining precise proper motion measurements from HST and Keck images with spatially-resolved radial velocity measurements from Keck spectroscopic observations.  The ONC is the nearest site of massive star formation and provides a unique opportunity to study in detail how young pre-main-sequence stars and clusters form and evolve.  Depending on the physical processes included in the model (e.g., turbulence, feedback, magnetic fields, etc.) current theories of star/cluster formation yield very different predictions for the internal dynamics and sub-structure within the cluster.  Thus, kinematic studies of the ONC are a powerful tool for distinguishing between the models and will provide important constraints on star formation in general.  A graduate student at UC San Diego will be heavily involved in this project."

Observational advances have transformed the landscape and have highlighted the limitations of current modeling attempts.  At the same time binary evolution modeling has not advanced significantly in the past decade; in turn, this has limited our ability to understand and interpret a number of current observational results related to binary populations.  Building on their past experience, the investigators in this project will advance the physical sophistication of binary modeling and compact object formation and evolution.  They will develop the next-generation binary-populations simulation tool (PSyDLib) with major, key advantages for self-consistent, physical modeling.  The team will take advantage of the continued increase in computational power and the public availability of MESA, a versatile, robust stellar structure and evolution code.  All the simulation codes will be made publicly available for other research projects.<br/><br/>This project will take advantage of the PI's established connections with local schools (urban and suburban in the Chicago area), prior/current work with high-school teachers, and astronomy's appeal to children to address a critical need in elementary- and middle-school level STEM education.  At all school levels the Next Generation Science Standards that are currently being implemented call for the introduction and use of computational thinking and modeling.  However, in this area most school teachers do not have expertise and voice their need for professional development and appropriate curriculum materials.  In collaboration with small teams of experienced teachers, the PI will develop computational astronomy curriculum materials.  The PI will also capitalize on past work on astronomy visualizations and develop new ones for mass transfer in binaries and X-ray binary formation.  The PI will use them extensively at public outreach presentations at Chicago's Adler Planetarium and the Evanston High School new planetarium.  The PI will also involve two female graduate students who will be trained in advanced computation, hence contributing to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.<br/><br/>More technically, the team will develop new modules and an innovative hybrid software structure to incorporate (i) realistic mass-transfer sequences and physical assessment of stability, (ii) advanced treatment of common-envelope evolution eliminating the need for ad-hoc parameterization, and (iii) self-consistent orbital evolution for the general case of eccentric, asynchronous binaries due to tides and mass transfer.  The project's science goals focus on studies of (i) core-collapse supernovae in terms of the physical properties of both their progenitors and their binary companions and compare to observational results from supernova surveys and (ii) high-mass X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, which provide a plethora of observed systems with very different properties than originally expected.  Given the more substantial XRB samples, the investigators will actually use the comparisons in (ii) to calibrate their models and assess the reliability of predictions for (i).   The anticipated results will not only help to explain current observations but will also provide motivation and predictions for future multi-wavelength observations."

These high-mass stars output enormous amounts of energy and live only for a few million years before ending their life as a supernova. A major challenge in astrophysics is to understand how these stars are formed. The investigators will use the National Science Foundation's large radio telescopes to observe young high-mass stars, which are still growing as surrounding matter falls onto them. During this process some of the matter is expelled in the form of jets and outflows of hot gas. To make progress in our scientific understanding of high-mass star formation, the next step is understanding the flow of material near these stars. A systematic study of outflows and jets is thus urgently needed. With these radio telescopes, the investigators will chart the flow of matter near these stars. Specifically, the investigators will make new observations every few months and map the motion of the clumps of material over time. The project is a collaboration between a primarily Hispanic serving university in New Mexico and a primarily undergraduate institution in rural Illinois. Student involvement in the planned observations provide hands-on STEM education on a variety of educational levels. Students will also take part in institutional interchanges and public outreach activities lead by the principal investigators. This project will thereby promote the participation of women and minorities in science.<br/><br/>Ionized jets and molecular outflows are commonly present in high-mass proto-stars. This project will carry out a multiscale observational study which addresses fundamental unanswered questions on the physics of the mass outflows. The goals of the project are 1) to connect the ionized jets to the large scale molecular flows with high quality measurements of the momentum rates, 2) to directly measure the ionized jet motion via proper motion and spectral line observations, and 3) to use water and methanol maser observations to study the jet launching mechanism, as well as the momentum transfer between ionized and molecular gas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stars are the most natural timers to use, and star clusters provide the testing ground for many different age dating methods. This research group will develop selected orbiting multi-star groups in star clusters as precise standards for age dating. The goal is to reduce age uncertainties to under 10% over a huge range, from a youthful 100 million years to 4 billion years, like the Sun. Age measurement is becoming more and more important as larger telescopes allow us to study more distant, fainter stars and to understand their histories. <br/><br/>The investigators broader impact plan is centered on addressing the continuing underrepresentation of women and minorities within the physical sciences. The investigator will promote activities at their Hispanic-Serving Institution.  They plan active recruitment of minority students (especially early undergraduates), regular academic mentoring and career preparation guidance, and full-year research experiences.  Each of these components is important for establishing the flow of students into physical science careers and ultimately making them ""normal"" choices.<br/><br/>Reliable ages are an important ingredient in understanding the workings of stars and the assembly of the Milky Way galaxy. This research will use precise brightness, spectroscopic velocity, and interferometric position measurements of binary stars to infer precise ages, targeting star clusters that are in common use for calibration and testing of the most impactful age measurement techniques. For example, asteroseismology is providing ages for thousands of oscillating red giant stars cutting through the Milky Way, but the technique is currently subject to systematic errors that can be identified and corrected. Ages from the rotation periods of individual main sequence stars require calibration with objects of known age. Ages from cooling white dwarfs depend critically on the ability to predict the initial mass of the star that produced an observed white dwarf and determine its age. But most commonly in astronomy, the brightness and colors of groups of stars are used to estimate age, and this research will examine nearby clusters with the most precise brightness measurements for many members. As a bonus, precisely measured masses will provide an important and long-awaited new dimension for testing models of stars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By this method, nearly 200 simple molecules (such as water and ammonia) have been identified in our Milky Way galaxy.  In this research, scientists will make careful laboratory measurements of new molecules that could be detected by radio telescopes.   They will make very precise measurements of the molecules' signature, then go to telescopes to search for these signals in space.   The scientists will search for these molecules by observing clouds of gas surrounding stars which blow carbon, oxygen and other elements off their outer layers.  Molecules form as the gas from stars cool, and some of these molecules subsequently accumulate and form clumps called 'dust'.  These scientists will learn what types of molecules are formed in space around these stars. They are particularly interested in molecules familiar on Earth but which are unknown in space, like silicon oxides (e.g. sand), aluminum oxide (the white film on unpainted aluminum) and titanium oxide (the white color in paint and active component in sunscreen).  Some of these oxides of silicon, aluminum, and titanium are thought to be the building blocks of the dust that ultimately forms planets outside our own Solar System.<br/><br/>This research begins with laboratory measurements of rotational spectra of new complex molecules containing either two or three silicon, aluminum, or titanium atoms.  These molecules are more complex than those previously measured.  Next radio astronomers will unravel the chemistry in the inner envelopes of late-type carbon- and oxygen-rich evolved stars, which are a major source of planet forming dust. <br/><br/>Owing to many uncertainties in the chemical models of these sources, it is only through an empirical approach, which entails an integrated program of laboratory measurements and astronomical observations at high angular resolution and sensitivity, that astronomers may understand these complex regions. The molecules will be produced in widely used laboratory sources (either glow discharge, discharge nozzle, or laser ablation); their rotational spectra will be measured in the centimeter, millimeter, and sub-millimeter bands either with a Fabry-Perot cavity, broadband chirped pulse spectrometer, or non-resonant absorption cell; and the spectra will be analyzed with standard Hamiltonians and computer programs.<br/><br/>The search for the new molecular species in the laboratory will be guided by high level quantum chemical calculations of the structures which will be done by our expert collaborators, and will draw on 30 years of work on reactive molecules of astrophysical interest by our group. In addition to the contribution of this work to astronomy, direct detection of elusive titanium oxides, aluminum oxides, and silicon-bearing molecules in the laboratory will provide detailed information about their structures, which in turn will help applied physicists address vexing questions about the elementary reactions that govern the growth and their wide range of photo-catalytic and photovoltaic applications.<br/><br/>This research combines chemistry, electronics, physics and astronomy and is as an excellent topic for teaching, training, and learning. The outreach plan is two-pronged: (1) Provide mentorship and research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students through programs at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and Harvard; and (2) Create a spectral line molecular radio astronomy module for an innovative learning tool, called 'Spectral Explorer'.  <br/><br/>The Spectral Explorer is a browser-based spectra visualization and analysis tool.  The Spectral Explorer will be used in both high school classroom and public outreach learning settings.  The SAO Science Education Department (SED) is developing these events. As part of this effort, the SAO spectroscopy laboratory will be actively engaged in the planning and execution of specific tutorials, videos, spectral datasets, and case study resources which will be centered on the research described in this proposal. The Spectral Explorer lab will be disseminated via partnerships with the NSF, NASA and Smithsonian Affiliations networks to the ten thousand educators currently using SED resources and to the more than 50,000 public/citizen science users."

This is exactly what this project will provide, advancing our understanding of acceleration under various physical conditions, extending to space and solar plasmas closer to home, and thus helping to build intellectual bridges between plasma physics, astrophysics, and heliospheric physics.  The study includes training, support, and mentoring for a graduate student as well as varied research opportunities for undergraduates.  Visually arresting graphics presented through collaboration with the University of Colorado Fiske Planetarium will contribute to the public understanding of modern science.<br/><br/>Relativistic charged particles with extended power-law energy distributions are inferred to exist in many astrophysical systems, but the mechanisms for non-thermal particle acceleration (NTPA) are poorly understood.  Only recently have first-principles kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggested that reconnection and turbulence in highly magnetized plasmas can efficiently cause relativistic NTPA.  The challenge of translating the accumulated numerical results into a coherent theoretical picture is exacerbated by the size and complexity of modern PIC simulations, and the fact that theoretical models predate the simulations and have not been updated.  Many theories of NTPA are tied to the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, but without numerical confirmation.  This project will combine PIC simulations with analytical theory, determine whether the FP equation approach is applicable and measure the diffusion and advection coefficients, going beyond FP if necessary, and elucidate the deeper connections between reconnection and turbulence.  This project will advance theoretical understanding of relativistic NTPA in collisionless magnetic reconnection and turbulence under a variety of physical conditions, and contribute significantly to understanding the relativistic plasma environments around neutron stars and black holes.  By influencing thinking about NTPA in other space and solar plasmas, this work will help to connect plasma physics, astrophysics, and heliospheric physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These include the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background, the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the use of a variety of observational techniques to characterize the cosmology of the Universe.  Scientists have measured the six key cosmological parameters that govern the geometry of the Universe with great precision, but they have not yet connected the dots to understand how the seeds of early structure from the Big Bang evolved into the stars, galaxies, and black holes seen today in the local Universe.  In particular, there are very few observations of a period known as the ""Cosmic Dawn"" when the Universe was approximately 100 to 1000 million years old.  During the Cosmic Dawn, the first stars and galaxies formed out of a pristine hydrogen gas that was synthesized during the Big Bang.  As stars lit up, burned, and exploded in supernovae, the energy they released started to heat and then ionize the hydrogen that was not yet trapped in galaxies.  Today, astronomers observe that nearly all hydrogen between galaxies has been re-ionized into a plasma state.  The time when this happened is called the Epoch of Reionization.  This project will use the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a purpose-built telescope, to measure and characterize the Universe from the Cosmic Dawn to the Epoch of Reionization, to fill in this critical gap.   Astronomy has broad interest throughout society and serves as an excellent introduction to science and technology for young people.  In order to bring this impact to under-served students HERA has instituted an undergraduate outreach program called CHAMP, which serves as a significant summer internship program for underrepresented minorities at HERA partner institutions.<br/><br/>HERA is an international project with Partners in the US, UK, Canada, Italy and South Africa.  The telescope is well under construction in the Karoo region of Northern Cape South Africa at the South African Radio Astrophysical Observatory's Karoo Astronomy Reserve.  Starting in 2019, HERA will comprise 350 14-m antennas in close proximity to one another and operate from 50-250 MHz.  The Karoo location has been established as a special ""radio-quiet"" zone, meaning that efforts are undertaken to minimize the impact of the radio frequency emission that humans generate through our technology.  Currently operational, HERA is measuring the emission due to the red-shifted hyperfine transition of hydrogen gas, which has a rest frequency of 1420 MHz.  The expansion of the Universe redshifts these frequencies down to 50-250 MHz at the age of the Universe expected for the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization.  Given the expected structure of the gas over these redshifts, the signal is expected to be spectroscopically distinguishable from the much brighter foreground, which is predominantly spectrally smooth emission from our Galaxy's synchrotron radiation.  Given its sensitivity and special-purpose design, HERA is expected to accurately measure the reionization fraction over this span of epochs.  This measurement will allow us to understand the cosmology and astrophysics of the Universe over this transitional portion of its history.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The APF-50 Survey will discover rocky planets orbiting nearby stars and make a census of their masses and orbital shapes and sizes.

Newly-discovered planets will be mostly super-Earths and sub-Neptunes with orbital periods of 200 days or shorter, and possibly Earth-mass planets with orbital periods of a few days.  Using injection-recovery tests of the APF planet sensitivity, the team will map out the occurrence of small planets as a function of their masses and semi-major axes."

As planets form and grow, disks develop spiral arms, gaps, and eventually hollow cavities -- signposts of planet formation.  The investigators will study a sample of 30 dust disks covering all stages of the formation of planets.

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal."

Although it is believed that a considerable fraction of the energy in material flowing around pulsars, supernovae, and other strong sources, can be converted into very fast particles, which are identified by the patterns of radiation they give off, the mechanism is not well understood.  After this study, the Fermi mechanism will be much better characterized, and may be tightly constrained.<br/><br/>Acceleration of particles in collisionless shocks is at the heart of most models of non-thermal phenomena in the Universe.   Observations of synchrotron emission suggest that such shocks in pulsar wind nebulae, in jets from active galactic nuclei, in gamma-ray bursts, and in supernova remnants, can convert a significant fraction of the flow energy into relativistic particles with power-law spectra.  However, although it is usually invoked as the cause, the conditions for operation of the first-order Fermi mechanism and its efficiency are not understood from first principles.  This project will construct a self-consistent theory of shock acceleration by performing large-scale multidimensional particle-in-cell and hybrid simulations of astrophysical collisionless shocks, and study the microphysics of plasma instabilities, particle scattering, and magnetic field generation, necessary to calibrate nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration theory.  Specific questions include: 1) the criteria for existence of shock acceleration, and its efficiency; 2) how accelerated particles influence shock structure and evolution; 3) the proton and electron spectra generated in realistic shocks.  The tools developed during this work will enable multi-scale modeling of shocks and will derive particle spectra in the nonlinear regime from first principles.  This research will provide predictive power to the hypothesis that Fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks is the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and non-thermal particles, and could place tight constraints on the models of magnetization and on the composition of astrophysical outflows.<br/><br/>Because Fermi acceleration is a fundamental process in astrophysics, the results will be of value to observers, experimentalists, and theorists studying high-energy astrophysical and cosmological sources, and are even applicable to shocks in the solar system.  The findings will guide a new generation of laboratory experiments.  The work will involve postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students, training them in numerical modeling and visualization, and thus preparing them for careers in science and technology fields, where large-scale computing increasingly plays an important role.  An interactive plasma physics tutorial will be developed to bring intuitive understanding of these thorny subjects to specialists and the general public alike."

It is extremely hard to study these so-called ""exoplanets,"" because the glare of light from their parent stars hides them.  Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere greatly complicates studies using large ground-based telescopes.  To counteract this effect, most large telescopes now employ a technique called ""adaptive optics,"" or AO, to stabilize the image of a star.  With the image stabilized, astronomers can use other devices to suppress most of the starlight, enabling them to study the much fainter exoplanets around them.

About 98% of all stars - including our Sun - will end their lives as white dwarfs. The proposal team consists of senior researchers at three institutions, and they have a vast combined experience in observational studies of white dwarfs.  Their study of these stars will provide critical insights about the history of the Milky Way galaxy.  The project to measure the properties of all white dwarf stars in our solar neighborhood will produce results that are of fundamental importance in several areas of stellar astrophysics.  They will also enhance the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs, which has been a primary resource for the astronomical community (both professional and amateur) for four decades.  PI Holberg has authored a popular science book and is working on two more, including one about White Dwarfs.  CoPI Oswalt will share results from this program as an American Astronomical Society Shapley Visiting Lecturer.  This award will provide training opportunities for a University of Arizona graduate student and for undergraduate students from Villanova University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.<br/><br/>The proposal team will compile and characterize a volume-limited sample of the local white dwarf population within 50 parsecs.  This will increase the number of well-studied, nearby white dwarfs by an order of magnitude, and it will enable us to address questions such as the relative distribution of different white dwarf types, the binary fraction of white dwarfs, the local mass distribution and chemical evolution of the galaxy, white dwarf spectral evolution, and many others.  It will also provide a reference sample for the vast numbers of more distant white dwarfs likely to be discovered with future survey missions like Gaia and LSST.  The new observations will also provide significant enhancements to the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs, which serves as a fundamental reference."

Astronomers have found that galaxies grow through a balance of gas loss, gas in-fall, and star formation. However, what drives these processes is only poorly understood. She will model dwarf galaxies, which are ideal test subjects for studying galaxy growth.   The dwarf galaxies have low masses, making them especially sensitive to the energy input from newly forming stars.  The investigator plans a comprehensive comparison of the observations to their numerical models.<br/><br/>When studying the growth of dwarf galaxies, astronomers must first account for the environment in which they exist. Dwarf galaxies are generally found close to more massive galaxies, which can both prevent gas accretion onto dwarf galaxies and aid gas loss from them. Therefore, the investigator will examine the effects of both environment and internal processes on the growth of dwarf galaxies. Using extremely high-resolution, realistic computer simulations, she will map the flow of gas to identify what spurs and halts dwarf galaxy growth. To further study the effect of environment, she will compare the properties of dwarf galaxies at different distances from more massive galaxies. Finally, she will examine the gas transferred from dwarf galaxies to their massive neighbors, to better understand the connection between galaxies.<br/><br/>In parallel with this research, the investigator will develop computational exercises, such as labs and open-ended research projects, for undergraduate physics students. These lessons will develop students' programming abilities while reinforcing skills like problem solving and persistence.

After completion of the ALMA testing and evaluation phase, the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) at the University of Arizona (UA) acquired one of the two APA telescopes. After acquisition, the UA moved their APA to Kitt Peak, replacing the 40-year-old 12-m telescope, and rechristening the telescope as the new Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m. The subject proposal funds a modern, multi-wavelength receiver system which will realize the full scientific potential of the new ARO 12 m antenna. The receiver will cover the 1-4 mm wavelength range in four separate bands, and will enable a broad range of astronomical research including spectroscopy of molecular clouds and planetary nebulae, astrobiological studies of disks and pre-biotic molecules, and the study of black holes. The new receiver and 12 m antenna will have a broad user base with U.S. astronomers and scientists from universities and national labs, the Event Horizon Telescope consortium, and the European Southern Observatory (ESO). As part of this program ARO will allocate 28 days of observing time per year to the general U.S. community to access ARO's unique northern hemisphere observing capability and to enable pathfinder science for ALMA. The program will incorporate significant student training at all levels, from high school through graduate school. This telescope, along with the ARI 10 m telescope on Mt Graham, are perhaps the only remaining general purpose radio telescopes operated by a US university. As such, they are among the few remaining opportunities for direct student involvement in radio telescope instrumentation and operations.  <br/><br/>The dual-polarization 4-band receiver will cover the astronomically important atmospheric windows at 1, 2, 3, and 4 mm wavelength regions well suited to the Kitt Peak site. The 3 (84-116 GHz), 2 (130-180 GHz) and 1 mm (211-275 GHz) bands will employ ALMA-type, sideband-separating (SBS), superconducting (SIS) mixers, which represent the world's best in sensitivity and stability. SBS 2 mm mixers will be developed in collaboration with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Central Development Lab (CDL) to cover a band scientifically important and well matched to the Kitt Peak site. The mixer chip will be a series array of four SIS junctions, similar to ALMA Band 6, and will be fabricated by the University of Virginia Microfabrication Lab (UVML). The 4 mm band (67-90 GHz) will utilize NRAO HFET amplifiers, previously tested on the old ARO 12 m. This system will also be SBS through an E-band down-converter developed by ARO. The 3 mm mixers are already in ARO's possession and the 1 mm devices will be obtained from NRAO. The mixers/amplifiers will be mounted in the same dewar using a modular design with each band and associated optics positioned on a separate plate. The receiver system will bolt onto the flange of the antenna cabin at the secondary focus. The spectral-line control system is fully operational at the new 12 m and will accommodate the new receiver with minimal modification. The new receiver will be used mainly for spectroscopic observations of interstellar and circumstellar molecules, and will: i) cover important molecular transitions, such as the J=1 -> 0 lines of CO, HCN, N2H+, H2CO, and HCO+, used widely as density and temperature tracers in interstellar gas; and ii) provide wider frequency coverage necessary for many astrochemical programs. A major focus will be the investigation of the extent of molecular matter in the Galaxy. The subject work will redefine translucent cloud boundaries using low-level CO emission, characterize dense cloud cores chemically and physically, probe the sky as seen by Planck, and investigate hybrid gaseous/debris disks. The surprisingly rich chemical content of planetary nebulae and its connection to the diffuse interstellar medium will be further investigated. Combined with laboratory spectroscopy, the molecular carriers of the biogenic element phosphorus will be sought. The ARO 12 m will also join the Event Horizon Telescope for 1 mm VLBI observations, improving overall sensitivity and adding an intermediate baselines for probing the larger scale structure around black holes."

Wilson overlooking Los Angeles sits a Y-shaped array of six 1-m aperture telescopes. Unlike telescopes located on other mountaintops, these six are not used independently of each other, but are instead used in unison to effectively form a single larger telescope, an interferometric array, in which the optical and near-infrared light from each of the telescopes is combined with the light from its neighbors. Operation of the six 1-m telescopes as an interferometric array results in the ability to detect finer details (spatial resolution) in astronomical sources than would be possible if the 1-m telescopes were utilized individually. With physical separations between the six 1-m telescopes ranging from 33 to 331 meters, spatial resolutions better than 1 milliarcsecond are achieved. This far exceeds the resolution of the largest ground-based and orbiting telescopes, and is even an order of magnitude better than will be possible with the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) currently under development. The subject proposal requests funding for the development and implementation of a new backend (detection instrument) called MYSTIC (Michigan Young STar Imager for CHARA). MYSTIC is an infrared instrument for the CHARA Array specifically designed to image planet-forming disks around young Suns with the highest angular resolution in the world. The major advances of the MYSTIC instrument are realized through the utilization of 1) a high tech beam combiner, which combines the light from the six 1-m aperture telescopes, and 2) a new technology infrared detector, which converts the combined light into an electronic signal.<br/><br/>The heart of the MYSTIC instrument is the small format (320x256) SELEX eAPD camera and GRAVITY optical beam combiners.

It is extremely hard to study these so-called ""exoplanets,"" because the glare of light from their parent stars hides them.  Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere greatly complicates studies using large ground-based telescopes.  To counteract this effect, most large telescopes now employ a technique called ""adaptive optics,"" or AO, to stabilize the image of a star.  With the image stabilized, astronomers can use other devices to suppress most of the starlight, enabling them to study the much fainter exoplanets around them.  Many of the giant exoplanets radiate at thermal infrared wavelengths.

In this study the investigators explore how planetary nebula can form when stars are born with a sibling.  More than half the stars in the sky live their entire life with a companion and that proximity can change the course of evolution for both stars.  They seek to understand how two stars with about the same mass as the sun can interact at the end of their lives exchanging mass and driving winds that will create a planetary nebula.  It may be that only binary stars form such nebula and our ideas of the Sun's eventual demise must be revised. Using powerful supercomputer simulations they will track the gas flows from the two orbiting stars and determine how these mass exchanges can alter the fate of the stars.  These kinds of supercomputer algorithms are also used for other purposes, such as the high performance computer industry.  <br/><br/>This research project is focused on understanding magnetized outflows in evolved binary stars through specific new studies of Planetary Nebulae (PNe). As the final stage of mass loss for these stars, PNe represent a critical step in the mass and chemical evolution cycle for more than half the material ejected into the ISM.  The ubiquity of PNe and their ease of observation also make them premier laboratories for testing new astrophysical theories. They will explore the dynamics of binary star mass transfer and mass loss through collimated outflows.  The research will explicate routes through which accretion disks can form in evolved binary systems and attempt to provide limits on the accretion rates onto and through those disks.  Using the conditions in the disks they will then study the formation and propagation of magnetic tower collimated outflows.  These Poynting-Flux Dominated flows are of fundamental interest because they represent a different category of MHD outflow from the kinetic energy dominated flows that have received greater study. The binary evolution (Common Envelope), mass transfer and magnetic outflow processes they study are of fundamental importance to the study of many astrophysical systems from Type Ia SNe to Microquasars. In addition their work developing the AstroBEAR AMR code is of particular benefit computational astrophysicists <br/>  <br/>Beyond the direct scientific research benefits of their study and the dissemination of the AstroBEAR software, the PI is a co-founder of National Pubic Radio's 13.7 Cosmos and Culture Blog, a regular on-air science commentator for NPR's All Things Considered and regular contributor to the New York Times.  In this project they will develop a series of on-air programs for radio that will track the progress of a student and the post-doc as they carry out the research project."

These stars are over 13 billion years old and thus formed very early in the Universe soon after the Big Bang.  These low mass stars change very slowly with time and so preserve a ""chemical fingerprint"" of the Universe at the time they formed.  The investigator intends to organize observations of stars into a chemical sequence leading to a better understanding of the elements that we find on Earth.  The investigator will expand upon her public education efforts by working with undergraduate students to produce videos describing the astronomical connection to common consumer products.  The videos will be distributed through the institution's outreach program and the students will gain skill in media work and science communications.<br/><br/>The investigator will use the large Magellan telescope in Chile to observe these old stars in the Milky Way galaxy and small satellite dwarf galaxies.  This will enable her to unlock critical information about the very first stars that first lit up the Universe and the associated first element production events that cannot be obtained with any other method.  It will also provide long-missing details about the production sites of the very heaviest elements, e.g., silver and gold.  She will also search for surviving first galaxies using stellar chemical composition as a key indicator.  Altogether, this enables her to reconstruct how the Universe evolved from just a few stars into today's rich and complex Universe.  Her results will guide many research areas such as early star and galaxy formation, nuclear physics, stellar nucleosynthesis, dwarf galaxies, formation of the Milky Way, and complement far-field observations to be obtained with current and next generations of telescopes."

There are hundreds of Globular Clusters orbiting around our own Milky Way galaxy. Globular Clusters serve as fossils that trace conditions in the universe at the earliest times, when galaxies were just starting to form. Intriguing differences are observed between individual Globular Clusters, which provide clues about the formation of our Galaxy. In Globular Cluster stars, the concentrations of atoms belonging to different chemical elements vary in ways that challenge conventional wisdom about the ages, origins and life cycles of stars. The investigators will make observations with some of the world?s largest and best-equipped telescopes to test theoretical models of how stars, star clusters and galaxies come to be.<br/><br/>The principal work involves (a) developing a unified scenario for self-enrichment among star clusters; (b) understanding the stellar content of Globular Clusters through novel dynamical and stellar population investigations; and (c) studying the relationship between Globular Clusters and galaxies at the extreme upper limit of the Globular Cluster mass function. New optical and near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations will be made to explore how measurable quantities (such as mass-to-light ratios and abundance anomalies) depend on age, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and dynamical evolution. Intriguing trends, many of which confound standard interpretations, have already been identified: 1) self-enrichment appears to be implicated in abundance spreads in Galactic Globular Clusters and in a mass-metallicity relation found in extragalactic Globular Cluster systems; 2) observed properties of galaxy stellar halos, and initial measurements of gas in intermediate-age clusters, each challenge the favored mechanism for self-enrichment; 3) the dependence of mass-to-light ratio on metallicity is opposite to that expected from stellar evolution models; 4) an expanding zoo of compact stellar systems has been identified, including ultra compact dwarfs, that could be formed either by tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies or from Globular Cluster mergers; 5) the elevated mass-to-light ratios of ultra compact dwarfs may be explained by massive central black holes. The investigators will clarify each of these issues, test stellar evolution and population synthesis models, and trace the origins of compact stellar systems.<br/><br/>Since Globular Clusters are more complex than formerly realized, understanding their properties and how they relate to other types of stellar systems has wide implications in astrophysics; inferences drawn from Globular Clusters inform theories of the formation and evolution of stars, galaxies, black holes, and dark matter.

Despite a wealth of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum over the last four decades, much of what happens in the deep interior of NS remains inscrutable. Knowledge of neutron star physics is growing rapidly, due to X-ray telescopes in space, laboratory nuclear experiments, and gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  A research group at Michigan State University will help astronomers to better understand neutron stars by modeling the thermally unstable ignition of carbon on the NS surface and the resulting explosion (a ""superburst"") using a state-of-the-art multidimensional hydrodynamics computer code.  The models can reveal conditions in the outer layer of neutron stars, and help answer some critical science questions identified in National Academy reports: what is the nature of matter at exceedingly high density and temperature?, and what controls the mass, radius, and spin of compact stellar remnants?  The planned work includes activities to recruit the next generation of scientists and to inform the public, who ultimately support the scientific endeavor.  The group will develop educational resources to make it easier to use open-source computer simulations to explore stellar physics and incorporate discoveries made during the award into public talks at Michigan State's Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are unique natural laboratories to study quantum chromodynamics at finite density and low temperature.  A number of recent observational, theoretical, and experimental developments have raised new questions about the internal constitution of neutron stars. For low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the neutron star accretes hydrogen- or helium-rich material, X-ray observations of accretion-induced phenomena over timescales ranging from seconds to decades provide important information about different layers of the neutron star. During accretion, runaway thermonuclear burning of the accreted material is observable as a Type I X-ray burst. The thousands of X-ray bursts and the rarer and more energetic superbursts encode information about the physics of dense matter and the workings of the accretion disk and boundary layer.   The researchers will use ignition models that account for relevant heating and cooling processes in the neutron star crust. The simulations will yield testable predictions for both the precursor burst observed from some sources and the evolution of luminosity with time during the superburst. The models will inform astronomers about conditions in the outer layer of neutron stars, and may give information about the explosion's effect on the accretion flow and the nature of nuclear flames in dense matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multi-mode fibers are the only type that can be used at an astronomical focal plane.  However, coupling to single mode fibers enable using other photonics innovations:  fiber Bragg gratings and complex waveguide Bragg gratings, which filter out specific wavelengths and suppress unwanted noise.  Noise arises from water vapor / OH sky emission and is the major source of unwanted background in an astronomical IR spectrograph.  The final innovation is an arrayed waveguide grating -- a lightwave circuit fabricated on silicon that forms the dispersive element.

The detection of the faint short gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB170817A, the EM counterpart of a gravitational wave event provides the most conclusive evidence that NS mergers are indeed the progenitors of short GRBs.  The need to fully understand the EM signals from GRBs is even more pressing after this discovery.   A research collaboration between California State University, Sacramento, Purdue University, and Northwestern University will investigate short GRBs and how they are produced by jets, or beamed outflows of ionized matter, which have geometrical structure.  When such jets are misaligned with respect to the direction from the GRB to earth, they are observed to be under-luminous, or relatively faint, as was seen for GRB170817A.  The researchers will use relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to fully explain current and future observations of EM counterparts from GW signals.  An important component of this proposed research is training both graduate and undergraduate students, who will be encouraged to conduct original research projects.  The research team will also broaden participation in science and public literacy with a series of public lectures at the soon-to-be opened Sacramento State planetarium.  They will also continue outreach efforts at the three campuses, including public solar viewing parties, engaging grade 6-12 students with hands-on activities and assisting high school educators to design hands-on classroom demonstrations.<br/><br/>The proposal team will expand on its correct prediction that the most likely electromagnetic signal from a neutron star merger event would be a faint gamma-ray pulse from a misaligned GRB jet.   Based on preliminary MHD simulations of a short GRB jet, the team found that a jet is naturally expected to have some structure, where the jet's properties vary smoothly with angle, such that the luminous core is surrounded by a slower, fainter sheath, consistent with observations of GRB170817A. The researchers will carry out large-scale relativistic MHD simulations of short GRB jets in realistic ambient gas profiles and realistic initial black hole conditions in order to determine the structure of the jet. Through these simulations, they will follow the jet from the launching region, through the confining ambient gas and the break out distance, where its slower sheath forms, all the way to the transparency region where the gamma-ray signal is expected to be produced. The work will be complemented by analytical studies of jet collimation by a confining medium as the jet breaks out from it. The team will calculate the expected signal from a jet pointed at an arbitrary angle to the observer for a broad range of prompt emission models and from the accompanying long-term afterglow emission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wilson overlooking Los Angeles sits a Y-shaped array of six 1-m aperture telescopes. Unlike telescopes located on other mountaintops, these six are not used independently of each other, but are instead used in unison to effectively form a single larger telescope, an interferometric array, in which the optical and near-infrared light from each of the telescopes is combined with the light from its neighbors. Operation of the six 1-m telescopes as an interferometric array results in the ability to detect finer details (spatial resolution) in astronomical sources than would be possible if the 1-m telescopes were utilized individually. With physical separations between the six 1-m telescopes ranging from 33 to 331 meters, spatial resolutions better than 1 milliarcsecond are achieved. This far exceeds the resolution of the largest ground-based and orbiting telescopes, and is even an order of magnitude better than will be possible with the extremely large telescopes (ELTs) currently under development. The subject proposal requests funding for the development and implementation of a new backend (detection instrument) called MYSTIC (Michigan Young STar Imager for CHARA). MYSTIC is an infrared instrument for the CHARA Array specifically designed to image planet-forming disks around young Suns with the highest angular resolution in the world. The major advances of the MYSTIC instrument are realized through the utilization of 1) a high tech beam combiner, which combines the light from the six 1-m aperture telescopes, and 2) a new technology infrared detector, which converts the combined light into an electronic signal.<br/><br/>The heart of the MYSTIC instrument is the small format (320x256) SELEX eAPD camera and GRAVITY optical beam combiners. The near-IR camera array is HgCdTe utilizing a Si multiplexer with an order of magnitude reduction in readout noise, which is critical improving the sensitivity of the CHARA array to achieve the science goals of the program. The optical core of MYSTIC will be a highly optimized integrated optics combiner made available through a strategic collaboration with the Institut de Planetologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble. The proposed program assembles an international team to provide the CHARA and US communities with an imaging interferometric telescope that will open up new discovery space for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet studies."

It will be accompanied by broad outreach in appropriate venues for writing and speaking.<br/><br/>The investigators use the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald Observatory, in Texas, to search for the collision of supernovae. Narrow-band filters permit a rapid search for emission of hydrogen features that signify the presence of the collision of the supernova with previously-expelled hydrogen-rich material. The narrow-band filter observations also indicate variations in the strength of the hydrogen emission, which is a further clue to the nature of the interaction. The investigators will continue studies of collisions with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope to confirm that the hydrogen emission is from shocked material and not from ambient concentrations of hydrogen in the interstellar medium. They perform observations at other wavelengths, including the use of the NSF's Very Large Array radio observatory, to further constrain the properties - temperature and density - of the shocked material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because the Sun lies in the flat Milky Way disk and because nearly all star formation occurs within this disk. Looking at the sky, the disk appears as a relatively thin band, with stars at all distances found within this band. This project will disentangle this band of light into a three-dimensional map with the aim of understanding the global star formation in our Galaxy. This map will allow us to differentiate between the brightness of regions (an observed property) with their luminosities (an intrinsic property). The team will create the three-dimensional map by measuring the brightness of all known massive star formation regions at infrared and radio wavelengths, and will use radio observations to turn the infrared and radio brightnesses into luminosities. Local high school students will assist in the observations, providing vital research opportunities for the students of West Virginia. The PI and his students will compare the distribution of derived luminosities with that of other galaxies to determine the type of galaxy we live in. They will also estimate how many stars our Galaxy is forming. These results will help us to better understand star formation in our Galactic home.<br/><br/>There is a severe lack of communication between Galactic and extragalactic astronomers because there is no complete sample of Galactic star forming regions that can be compared to those of external galaxies. The team will solve this problem by creating a catalog of all Galactic HII regions ionized by single O-stars using radio recombination line observations. Local high school students will help with the observations, providing vital science opportunities for the students of West Virginia. These observations will allow us to compute kinematic distances from the observed radial velocities using a rotation curve model. The team will supplement the distances by locating clusters of HII regions that have similar radial velocities, and presumably similar distances, and will adjust for catalog biases using a population synthesis model. The PI and his students will derive HII region fluxes at wavelengths from 8 micron to 21 cm and turn these fluxes into luminosities using the catalog distances. They will investigate three extragalactic results found in studies of the HII region luminosity function (LF): the break in the Galactic LF seen in some galaxies, the finding that ''clustered'' and ''distributed'' HII-region LFs have different shapes, and the correlation between the galaxy's LF shape and its Hubble type. The total Milky Way luminosity can then be computed by summing the luminosities of all catalog HII regions. The total Milky Way luminosities will then be converted into star formation rates using extragalactic star formation rate calibrations."

The proposers will develop detailed numerical simulations to determine the source excitation mechanisms and test their efficiencies.  These simulations will be used to generate synthetic spectra, which can be tested to determine their sensitivity to pressure, temperature and velocity fluctuations.

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal."

Galactic winds are a key component of this exchange of matter and energy.  This project aims to study the initiation and propagation of galactic winds with particular focus on the role of particles moving at speeds near the speed of light.  Such particles are known as cosmic rays.  (In fact, such cosmic rays from our own Milky Way Galaxy interact with each of us every day!)  The major outcome of this project will be improved and extended models of galactic winds (1) that build insight into the nature of galactic winds, (2) that can be used by astronomers to connect galaxy and cosmic ray properties with wind properties, and (3) that can be adapted to advanced computer simulations of how galaxies form and change throughout their lifetimes.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training graduate and undergraduate students in plasma and computational physics and by using the project results to develop teaching materials for university courses.  In addition, the investigators will develop a new public outreach program, ""The Sun in the Park,"" that will offer solar viewing and participatory exercises in urban parks in Madison and Milwaukee.<br/><br/>More technically, winds are detected from galaxies of many types.  Simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have shown that star formation must be limited by feedback processes and that galactic winds driven by stellar energy and momentum output may be a key part of this feedback.  Radio and gamma-ray probes of cosmic rays in a variety of galactic environments have greatly extended our knowledge of cosmic ray properties and those of the underlying galaxies.  Although cosmic rays account for a small fraction of the energy output from stars, they have an outsized role in driving galactic winds through their high mobility, long cooling times, and strong coupling to the background through plasma waves.  This project will investigate the basis for this coupling in a variety of interstellar environments.  This part of the work will address whether cosmic rays couple efficiently to both fully and weakly ionized outflows, how small scale interstellar turbulence affects momentum and energy transfer, and how extreme conditions including high gas densities and weak magnetic fields affect the coupling.  The investigators will create a versatile grid of outflow models based on a small number of parameters to aid in interpreting observations of winds and implementing them in galaxy simulations.  They will use this work as a basis for improved treatments of cosmic rays in collaborative advanced numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution."

However, at present we do not fully understand basic carbon chemistry in clouds, or how to interpret CO, CI, and CII emission. This project, led by Dr. Mark Wolfire, brings to bear state-of-the-art theoretical modeling tools to address several problems in carbon chemistry and line emission in the interstellar medium (ISM). The result will be a fundamentally better understanding of carbon-based chemistry in atomic and molecular gas plus modeling tools to interpret Galactic and extragalactic observations of [CII], [CI], and CO emission.<br/><br/>The following problems are addressed in this project: 1) The reservoir of molecular gas available for star formation is important for understanding galaxy evolution. This mass is usually measured by CO rotational line emission. However, there is also molecular hydrogen (H2) gas that does not contain bright CO, and the mass of this gas is expected to dominate at low levels of metallicity. What is the dependence of this dark molecular gas on metallicity, and how can it be traced by [CII], and [CI] line emission? 2)The estimated abundance of CO in molecular clouds is typically 5-10 times lower than the measured carbon abundance in the diffuse ISM; however, it is expected that nearly all of the non-refractory carbon should be in the form of CO. Where is the carbon? This research team will use observations and models to converge on an understanding of the carbon budget. 3)The energy generation and flow in molecular clouds is a long standing problem in ISM physics. Mid- and high-transition CO line emission is sensitive to temperature near the cloud surface but is often brighter than predicted by models. Can the CO line emission be understood by radiative heating plus novel chemical pathways or are mechanical sources of heating required? 4)The freeze-out of oxygen (O), carbon, and nitrogen (N) molecules in opaque clouds presents a host of theoretical problems. For example, the freeze-out of water ice produces a high C/O gas-phase ratio that radically changes the carbon chemistry. The models developed by Dr. Wolfire will further our understanding of the physical grain and gas conditions, depletion and desorption processes, and when a steady-state or time dependent description applies - a distinction important for calibrating a chemical clock for collapsing cores. 5) All models of diffuse clouds vastly underestimate the observed abundance of even simple carbon-based molecules. High temperatures produced by shocks or the dissipation of turbulent energy might be required, but can an exploration of chemical rate coefficients lead to alternative explanations?<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project cover several areas. Dr. Kaufman, a member of the research team, teaches astronomy at a large, public university with a student body that includes many first generation students, many students from underrepresented groups, and an institutional commitment to STEM education for students in all majors. Kaufman will disseminate the results of this work in general education courses for non-science majors, advanced courses for majors, and student research projects. Support for a student assistant is budgeted so that an undergraduate or graduate student, preferably one from an underrepresented group, may participate in the research project. Kaufman?s department has recently created (with funding from donors) a new center for faculty/student collaboration called the ""Astro/Physics Computation and Visualization Lab,"" designed as a space for students to work on computational research problems. Here they build skills in computation, analysis and presentation that will serve them well, regardless of their ultimate career path. This is in line with the NSF goal of creating a broad, skilled, scientific workforce for the nation. Dr. Wolfire will also lead graduate students in project research. The results will be made available through a well-known web site, the PDR Toolbox. This site has been used by hundreds of astronomers to analyze their observations using state-of-the-art models. The code will be listed and made available on the ASCL (Astrophysics Source Code Library)."

Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.

Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.<br/><br/>More technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources."

Warren's work will be the first to add neutrino flavor mixing to existing sophisticated models of supernovae arising from the collapse of the core of a dying massive star.  This will help astronomers to better understand how a supernova explodes and how it creates elements.  Warren will also work with an outreach program to host free astronomy nights in public spaces, with the aim of reaching communities that are not otherwise engaged by most science outreach efforts.<br/><br/>Warren will incorporate a model of neutrino flavor mixing into the FLASH supernova code to study the effects of neutrino mixing, including matter enhancements and neutrino self-interactions on core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe).  This project will use both spherically symmetric and two-dimensional simulations to study the effect of neutrino flavor transformations on the range of supernova progenitors, in particular the impact on nucleosynthesis, explodability, the observable neutrino signal, the onset of the neutrino driven winds, and the resultant neutron star and black hole mass distribution.  This will lead to a more complete understanding of supernova neutrinos, which in turn will inform the interpretation of observed CCSNe neutrinos and improve our knowledge of the contribution of CCSNe to galactic chemical evolution.

Actively growing black holes, also known as active galactic nuclei, are some of the greatest 'recyclers' of matter and energy in the Universe. These accreting black holes are on the scale of our solar system, but have been observed to drive outflows of hot (ionized) gas, known as jets, reaching distances of up to a few million light years (equivalent to typical galaxy separations). These jets have a major impact on both their host galaxies and the clusters of galaxies in which they reside. However, it is still unclear how much energy these jets carry, how they are physically launched from the black hole, and how particles comprising the gas are accelerated to very high energies very far from the black hole engine. The goal of this project is to utilize over 30 years of archival radio imaging with NSF facilities along with new observations, to make the first-ever large compilation of time-lapse observations of dozens of jets over a much larger range of scales than ever before: from very close to the black hole (a few light years) to thousands or millions of light years. Because these jets are moving at nearly the speed of light, we can observe the movement of the gas within the jet on several-year timescales - work that is possible for a large number of jets now that extensive radio archives cover several decades. Mapping the velocity structure of jets will allow us to finally investigate the nature of bright 'knots' in the jet flow, probing regimes of extreme particle acceleration, and to calculate the total energy carried by jets in to the galactic and extra-galactic environment. This is not only critical for understanding the jet phenomenon itself, but will also allow us to improve large-scale computer models of how to Universe was built up over time.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>A major open question in Astronomy is the nature of the bipolar jets of relativistic, ionized plasma seen to emanate from a subset of super-massive black holes at the centers of galaxies.   An important tool that has been developed over the last two decades is the use of proper motions (motions on the sky) to track the movement of plasma within these jets, both with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and more compact interferometers like the Very Large Array (VLA).  Because the plasma in these jets is relativistic (moving very close to the speed of light) and moving with a small angle to our line-of-sight, the motion of features in the jet flow can appear super-luminal (faster than light).  A map of the velocity 'field' of a jet, from parsec scales (close to the black hole) to hundreds or thousands of parsecs (outside the host galaxy) is a very important constraint on jet models, showing exactly how gas is accelerated and deposits energy into the environment. Further, measurements of superluminal speeds allow us to constrain intrinsic properties of jets that are very difficult to determine through any other means (including theoretical modeling, due to degeneracies). In this proposal, we aim to dramatically increase the number of extragalactic jets with measured proper motions on the kiloparsec scale, primarily through the use of the VLA archives. Along with complimentary work using the VLBA, the overall goal is to build the first catalog of jets with velocity fields mapped from the scale of the black hole environment to the final terminus of the jet as it impacts the intergalactic medium.  These goals will be accomplished by using both standard interferometric imaging techniques and a recently developed wavelet decomposition code. The science questions addressed by this work include the physical nature of the bright 'knot' structures in the jets, the origin of the anomalously high X-ray fluxes from these knots, the connection between morphological type and jet energetics, and the impact of jets on their environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This makes them critical for measuring the expansion rate of the universe. However, a limiting factor in their use for precision cosmology rests on our ability to correct for the dimming of SNe light due to intervening dust, a phenomenon known as ""dust extinction."" Astronomers at the University of Missouri - Columbia will study the dust extinction toward SNe Ia through a systematic exploration of about 60 SNe Ia observed by space-borne and ground-based telescopes over a broad wavelength range spanning from the ultraviolet through the optical to the near infrared. By comparing the observed photometry (spectrum and intensity of light) of each SN Ia with that of a pristine template SN Ia without extinction, the researchers will determine the extinction quantity and its wavelength dependence (i.e., extinction curve).  The derived extinction curve will be compared to theoretical models, enabling the scientists to explore the dust size and composition for each SN Ia. Finally, the researchers will explore whether and how the dust and extinction properties vary systematically with the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia as well as with relevant properties of their host galaxies.  This research will have a positive impact on training graduate students and on developing an undergraduate astronomy program at the University of Missouri, as well as educating non-science majors and the general public, through a vigorous program of community outreach.<br/><br/>A longstanding puzzle in the analysis of SN Ia light curves is the nature of their apparent color and brightness variations. The ""redder-dimmer'' color-luminosity relation widely used in cosmological SN Ia analyses masks the fact that it has two separate physical origins: (i) an intrinsic correlation, which arises from the physics of exploding white dwarfs and (ii) an apparent dimming and reddening due to interstellar dust in the host galaxy. The researchers will explore whether and how the dust and extinction properties vary systematically with the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia (e.g., intrinsic color, luminosity, light-curve shape, decline rate, spectroscopic properties, and expansion velocity) as well as the properties of their host galaxies (e.g., morphological type, metallicity).  The work will help astronomers to understand the dominant systematic effects for the determination of cosmological parameters from SNe Ia, knowledge of SNe intrinsic colors and dimming due to extinction by host galaxy. It could thus impact both supernova cosmology and the knowledge of extragalactic extinction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These black holes have masses that are up to billions of times the mass of the Sun.  Galaxies repeatedly merge with other galaxies during their lifetimes.  Thus, super massive black hole pairs form frequently.  These pairs of black holes make ripples in space and time called gravitational waves.   As such, they are prime targets for gravitational wave detectors.  Gravitational wave simulations provide a new way to explore the Universe.  The investigators' computer simulations will help determine how black hole binaries interact with surrounding material.  The investigators' simulations will help astronomers detect merging black holes and understand the regions surrounding the black holes.

These theorists seek to answer several questions important for understanding astronomical observations.  They will model the time it takes for the two black holes to merge in the presence of different types of gas disks.  Observationally, it is important to estimate how bright the region surrounding the SMBHB will be during merger.  The results will be applied to interpret observations of the stochastic gravitational wave background, periodicities in quasar light-curves in large time-domain surveys, and gravitational wave strength of stellar-mass BHs."

To do this, they will use the twin 8.4-meter Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) to monitor all of the massive, mature stars in 27 nearby star-forming galaxies.

The mean metallicity in the host galaxy and in the SNe environments will be inferred from the Oxygen abundances measured from these spectra. The PI and her collaborators will also obtain high-resolution images of the more distant galaxies in order to map the blue-light distribution in the host galaxies.  These will be used to characterize regions of active star formation and to determine the overall galaxy mass.  The color and metallicity of the spatially-resolved region around the SNe will also be used to draw conclusions about the mass and metallicity of the progenitors.  <br/><br/>Long-duration gamma-ray bursts and stripped supernovae are among the most powerful explosions in the universe.  Both are signals of the cataclysmic death of massive stars, but they contribute differently to the creation of heavy elements.  The research funded with this award will lead to a better understanding of the chemical evolution of the universe by providing tools to determine which properties of stars determine their ultimate fate.  This research will be integrated with the PI's education plans through two projects in cooperation with the American Museum of Natural History.  Professor Modjaz will teach an after-school course entitled ""Explosions in the Universe"".  The curriculum will be structured around teaching pedagogy that is likely to change student perceptions of the scientific process, using strategies and mentoring that enhance the learning of young women and underrepresented groups.  In addition, the PI will coordinate astronomers at New York City area astronomy departments to participate in the Science Research Mentoring Program through AMNH.  Through this program, high school students will participate in cutting-edge research and present their results at a workshop."

Such a compass works because its tiny magnetic needle aligns with the magnetic field of Earth and indicates the direction of North.  On scales much larger than Earth, our own Milky Way Galaxy also has its own magnetic field.  In fact, all galaxies in the Universe appear to have magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields can have profound effects on a galaxy's development throughout its lifetime.  Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.  Such a result could have a profound influence on our current understanding of fundamental physics, and its pursuit serves the national interest of developing US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training undergraduate and graduate students in general and computational astrophysics.  Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.<br/><br/>More technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources."

The detection of the faint short gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB170817A, the EM counterpart of a gravitational wave event provides the most conclusive evidence that NS mergers are indeed the progenitors of short GRBs.  The need to fully understand the EM signals from GRBs is even more pressing after this discovery.   A research collaboration between California State University, Sacramento, Purdue University, and Northwestern University will investigate short GRBs and how they are produced by jets, or beamed outflows of ionized matter, which have geometrical structure.  When such jets are misaligned with respect to the direction from the GRB to earth, they are observed to be under-luminous, or relatively faint, as was seen for GRB170817A.  The researchers will use relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to fully explain current and future observations of EM counterparts from GW signals.  An important component of this proposed research is training both graduate and undergraduate students, who will be encouraged to conduct original research projects.  The research team will also broaden participation in science and public literacy with a series of public lectures at the soon-to-be opened Sacramento State planetarium.

Based on preliminary MHD simulations of a short GRB jet, the team found that a jet is naturally expected to have some structure, where the jet's properties vary smoothly with angle, such that the luminous core is surrounded by a slower, fainter sheath, consistent with observations of GRB170817A. The researchers will carry out large-scale relativistic MHD simulations of short GRB jets in realistic ambient gas profiles and realistic initial black hole conditions in order to determine the structure of the jet. Through these simulations, they will follow the jet from the launching region, through the confining ambient gas and the break out distance, where its slower sheath forms, all the way to the transparency region where the gamma-ray signal is expected to be produced. The work will be complemented by analytical studies of jet collimation by a confining medium as the jet breaks out from it. The team will calculate the expected signal from a jet pointed at an arbitrary angle to the observer for a broad range of prompt emission models and from the accompanying long-term afterglow emission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These lines cool the gas and trace its physical conditions and reveal the surface temperatures and spatial distributions of the stars.  With previous NSF awards graduate and undergraduate students designed and built the ZEUS and ZEUS-2 spectrometers used on large submillimeter telescopes.  They discovered that at early times many of the most luminous dusty star forming galaxies formed up to 1000 stars per year in extended, multiple kiloparsec (kpc) sized ""disks.""  They speculate that these enormous star forming disks are created and nourished by gas that is infalling from the Cosmic Web which contains much of the gas reservoir of the Universe.  They plan to test this hypothesis by searching with their ZEUS-2 spectrometer for the inflowing gas in its C+ and N+ line emission at near million light-year scales.  To discover this infalling gas is to confirm the major mode of galaxy and star formation during the epoch when most of the stars in today's Universe formed and to investigate the formation of the largest galaxies in today's Universe.  Science will be publicly disseminated through teaching and outreach efforts including the K-12 programs like Focus for Teens and GRASSHOPR.<br/><br/>Measurement of C+ and N+ line emission from large scale flows will be supplemented by O++ observations of the central galaxy.  The three lines reveal the most massive stars on the main sequence and the ionizing flux and spatial extent of the stars.

We currently know very little about the compositions of these mysterious planets, and it has been suggested that this mass range may include both ""water worlds"" and ""mini-Neptunes"" with thick hydrogen envelopes around a rocky core. THE PI and her students will conduct a carefully-designed observational program to distinguish between these two scenarios and to measure the properties of these exoplanets. These measurements will offer key insights into the formation and migration histories of this surprising new class of planets.  This program will support thesis work for two graduate students as well as a series of undergraduate summer research projects. Students will have the opportunity to observe remotely on Keck and to travel to the telescope for observing runs at Palomar.<br/><br/>The PI and her students will combine a Keck/HIRES radial velocity campaign with Palomar transit photometry and spectroscopy in order to characterize new low-mass transiting planets and to develop improved cloud models for their atmospheres. They will use radial velocity studies to measure planetary masses, thereby constraining bulk compositions, and they will measure precise orbital ephemerides. For low-density super-Earths, they will use transmission spectroscopy to characterize the mean molecular weight of their atmosphere to distinguish between those that are water-rich and those with rocky cores surrounded by H/He envelopes. Transmission spectroscopy details can be obscured by upper-level clouds, so they will also study ""cool Neptunes"" in order to develop a better understanding of the cloud formation processes. These observations will utilize new capabilities for precision photometry and spectroscopy at Palomar and significantly enhance the science return from future atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST."

The team has developed their own theory about how elongated grains of dust in this ""interstellar medium"" are lined up.  This rather complex process involves magnetic forces or ""fields""---which are known to exist in space---and starlight.  The theory will be tested using observations from a range of telescopes, including the Herschel and Planck space telescopes, the airborne Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and the ground-based Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT), among others.  Magnetic fields affect the way gas moves through space, and particularly the way clouds collapse under their own weight to form stars.  Understanding magnetic fields is therefore hugely important when trying to understand how stars and planets like Earth are formed.  Graduate and undergraduate students from Santa Clara University and the University of Wisconsin will be heavily involved in this project.  A young post-doctoral researcher will also take a leading role in this effort.<br/><br/>This tri-institute collaborative project will develop an analytical version of the Radiative Alignment Torque (RAT) theory for the alignment of irregular, paramagnetic dust grains in the Interstellar Medium (ISM).  The theory has already had some qualitative successes in interpreting past observations.  The awardees now aim to quantitatively test the theory against a range of observations using an analytical version of the theory that incorporates realistic source structures.  When combined with optical and infrared polarization measurements, the RAT theory may be a powerful diagnostic tool for studying interstellar magnetic fields in a variety of environments (Giant Molecular Clouds, Accretion Disks, etc.).  Dust-induced polarization provides a relatively straightforward probe of the magnetic field if a reliable understanding of grain alignment is available.  Understanding foreground dust polarization is also crucial to studies of the cosmic microwave background.  The recipients of this award will provide classroom and hands-on training to students at Santa Clara University and the University of Wisconsin (UW), developing ""polarization classes (schools)"" that may also be used by non-affiliated undergraduate students.  The award also supports outreach aimed at the general public, including programs at the Lick Observatory and as part of the Lassen Dark Sky Festival.  Popular science content will be pursued through drafted magazine articles, as well as student involvement in popular astronomy broadcasting in Spanish at UW."

Stellar halos are thought to be made of stars that formed very early on, in the galaxy's newly formed disk, as well as stars that were originally part of smaller, dwarf, galaxies that fell into the large galaxy and were torn apart.  The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo.  Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow.  They will deduce the properties of destroyed ""dwarf"" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.  This will give insight into the properties of dwarf galaxies that did not survive until the present day. This program will train young astronomers and introduce high school students to astronomical research.<br/><br/>The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to our own. It is similar in many ways to our Milky Way galaxy, but shows evidence that it has merged with more small galaxies than the Milky Way.  The investigators, along with students, will use an archive of Keck telescope spectra from previous observations of tens of thousands of stars, and will also perform new spectroscopic observations.  They will use the spectra to measure the abundances of atomic elements and track the properties of the chemical environment in which the stars formed.  The investigators will perform the first large-scale chemical abundance study of Andromeda's stellar halo.<br/><br/>The investigators will recruit students to engage in summer research related to this program.  They will focus their recruitment at schools that have a large fraction of students from demographic groups that are under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Because rotation is common in the Universe, most accretion systems form disks swirling around the central gravitating object, where material must transfer away its rotational inertia, or angular momentum, before continuing inwards.  The matter flowing inwards also spends time in the disk converting energy into the outgoing radiation by which these objects can be observed.  This research will apply new methods to understanding the process of angular momentum transport in disks around white dwarf stars, and may finally settle whether the currently dominant model is in fact correct.<br/><br/>Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) turbulence has become the dominant research framework for understanding angular momentum transport and the release of accretion power in accretion disks across all of astrophysics, from proto-planetary disks to active galactic nuclei.  Although the ultimate goal is to model observed sources, little attention has been paid so far to dwarf nova outbursts in accretion disks orbiting white dwarfs, which offer the most interesting observational constraints on angular momentum transport.  Using vertically-stratified, radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) shearing box simulations of MRI turbulence, this research will build on recent results showing intermittent thermal convection.  Three new studies are planned: (1) ensure that the thermal convection is numerically resolved, and understand how it enhances turbulent transport, (2) incorporate non-ideal MHD in the largely neutral state to see if MRI turbulent transport can be sustained in the quiescent state; and (3) incorporate lessons learned about the vertical structure and angular momentum transport into existing alpha-based models of the hydrogen ionization disk instability.  This direct confrontation between the MRI model and observations will firm up the theoretical foundation of the hydrogen ionization disk instability, and allow observations of dwarf novae and low mass X-ray binaries to constrain more effectively the properties of MRI turbulence.<br/><br/>One graduate student will develop their thesis from this project, several undergraduates are expected to be involved, and the research will inform public talks, including a new one being developed specifically on the science contained in this work."

Currently, more than 1800 confirmed planetary systems beyond our solar system (i.e. extrasolar planets or exoplanets) have been discovered through ground and space-based astronomical techniques, with an additional 3600 candidate systems yet to be confirmed.  These recent discoveries have resulted in dramatic growth in research related to the study of exoplanets with the ultimate objective being the discovery and characterization of habitable Earth-sized systems.  The primary goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the interactions between stars and their planets, in particular the role of magnetic fields, to ultimately provide information on the habitability of exoplanet systems.  The project's objectives are particularly well-matched to the interdisciplinary goals of the INSPIRE program.  First, the project will attack a problem of significance to a broad scientific community, namely the characterization and identification of habitable exoplanets.  Second, this research will provide an improved understanding of the Sun's interaction with the planets of our solar system.  Furthermore, this project has potential for significant societal impact with regards to the search for life elsewhere in the Universe.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project will apply techniques and methods drawn from the space physics community to the traditionally astrophysical research area of exoplanets. The project team has significant expertise in computational modeling of the magnetospheres of rocky planets like the Earth and gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.  They will combine their magnetospheric code with available magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere in order to model interactions of the solar wind with planetary magnetospheres.  A key aspect of the project is to apply these combined models to a much broader class of star-planet interactions by scaling the models to simulate a wide range of stellar parameters.  Once the star-planet interactions are modeled, then given varying levels of stellar activity and planetary magnetospheric characteristics, the models will be used predict radio emission for a wide range of systems.   These predictions can then be used to target specific systems for further observation and characterization as to their potential habitability."

We have expectations for how these orbits should behave.  Planets follow elliptical orbits around stars.  They repeat the same path millions or even billions of times over the years with each revolution taking the same amount of time, known as the 'period'.  The stars themselves follow orbits that form 'rosette' patterns as they move through a galaxy.  These orbits can take hundreds of millions of years to go even once around. Rosette orbits can be described with two periods: the 'azimuthal period' encapsulates how long it takes for the star to go around the galaxy; the 'radial period' describes how long it take for the star to get between the points along its orbit that are closest to and farthest from the galaxy's center and back again. <br/><br/>The nature of stellar orbits is set by the distribution of matter that influences them.  Planets move around matter that is concentrated in the central stars.  Stars in the galaxy are moving within the combined distribution of stars, gas, and dark matter.  Both elliptical and rosette orbits are known as 'regular' orbits since their paths are predictable and repeating.  However, it is also expected that some orbits in the Universe are 'chaotic.'  These orbits do not have patterns that repeat with well-defined periods and hence are not predictable.  And---just as the nature of elliptical and rosette orbits is set by the matter distribution---so is the importance of chaos.  Orbits are more likely to be chaotic if the visible and dark matter distributions are complex.<br/><br/>The investigator will also continue her work with underrepresented groups in the sciences.

The proposed work will explore a new mathematical approach to deducing the nature of stellar orbits around galaxies, whether they are regular or chaotic.  Over the last 20 years, streams of stars on similar orbits have been observed around our Galaxy.  In prior work, the proposers have shown that the morphologies of these streams are sensitive to the presence (or absence) of chaos.  Only on very regular orbits can these streams remain coherent.  And the presence of chaos can tell us about how the elusive dark matter around galaxies is distributed.<br/><br/>Theoretical studies of the nature of orbits---regular or chaotic---in dynamical systems (galaxies being just one example) are essential to building a deep understanding of the global structures that the orbits support.  In recent work the investigator has discovered that signatures of the nature of orbits can be observed in structures around our own Galaxy, formed from the disruption of satellite systems.  They found one stellar stream associated with globular cluster Palomar 5 that is long and thin with a simple structure.   Another stream of stars in the constellation Ophiucus is extraordinarily truncated.  The investigator will (i) explore the physical manifestations of regularity and chaos in stellar debris more generally and (ii) develop methods for making maps of the nature of orbits around galaxies using these signatures.  The project combines tools and techniques from the classical study of non-linear dynamics with numerical experiments that follow the evolution of ensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions closely clustered in phase-space.  They will extend their study to two new regimes: the evolution of chaotic orbits over short timescales (tens of orbits) and the observable signatures of this evolution in the full phase-space structure of ensembles of orbits.  They will also explore how regular and chaotic orbits can support stellar structures beyond the traditional study of self-consistent galactic components, including unbound stellar associations."

Traditional aluminum coatings are durable, but not highly reflective at all wavelengths.  Silver has better all-wavelength reflectance, but will develop pin-holes and flake away in a short time unless clever methods are used to deposit it on a glass mirror blank.  The development of such methods is the goal of this investigation, and a goal with far-reaching applications to many different kinds of future instruments.<br/><br/>The essence of the technical approach to improved durability, high-reflectance silver coatings, is Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).  ALD is a relatively new, sequential chemical vapor process taking advantage of self-limiting surface reactions. ALD coatings have several desirable properties, notably excellent film structure, conformal coverage, and excellent thickness uniformity and control.  ALD is now a mature process used widely in the silicon wafer industry. To date, however, ALD has been limited to relatively small substrate sizes and is rarely used for optics, owing to its relatively slow speed.  This project will place ALD barrier layers on top of silver deposited by conventional physical vapor deposition (PVD) to get films more durable than PVD alone.  The process proposed is a thus hybrid process, with most of the coating done with PVD processes and the barrier layers added with the ALD system.  Improvements in ALD deposition speed are also planned to allow coating of larger substrates in reasonable times.<br/><br/>This project has immense broader impacts in that it enables dramatically improved practical performance of a vast range of astronomical instrumentation.  In addition, students will be involved, and there is a strong commitment to plain-language explication of the research and its results.<br/><br/>Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program."

This approach can yield important details about the physical properties of the source: its temperature, chemical composition, density, mass, and velocity, among others.  Constructing very efficient, wide spectral coverage, high-resolution mapping spectrographs is therefore an effective approach to getting the most from our very largest ground-based telescopes.  Dr. H. Lewis (California Association for Research in Astronomy together with the California Institute of Technology and the University of California) proposes to complete the development of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectrograph for the 10-m Keck II telescope atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii with new optics optimized for the red portion of the spectrum.  The final instrument will provide an extraordinary platform for carrying out sensitive assessments of galaxy formation and evolution in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, to study the interstellar medium in external galaxies, to probe star clusters and nebulae in our own Milky Way galaxy, and to track the process of star formation within those clusters.<br/><br/>The Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) is designed to provide seeing-limited visible band, integral field spectroscopy with moderate to high spectral resolution (up to R = 20,000), selectable slicer scales and fields of view, high efficiency, and excellent sky subtraction. KCWI will benefit from the Keck II telescope's large, 10-m aperture and excellent site, providing a dual-channel, modular implementation. The blue channel of KCWI is nearly complete; the red channel to be funded through this proposal will extend the spectral coverage to the entire optical window from 3500 to 10500 angstroms and enable scientists to address several of the key questions relating to the process of the formation and evolution of external galaxies, and thereby of the development of matter in the universe.<br/><br/>Funding for the development of the red channel of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its participation in the Major Research Instrumentation program."

These investigators have obtained telescope time to observe thirty-six large asteroids in the main asteroid belt with an instrument that will provide very high resolution observations of these asteroids.  Their shapes, sizes, any moons that are present, and information about the asteroids' compositions will be uncovered.  All of this information will give the investigators clues about how these multiple-asteroid systems formed and, further, how the major planets in our Solar System formed.  This project serves the national interest by advancing our scientific understanding of how our Solar System formed and changed within its lifetime.  The investigators will tell the story of their research to both students and the general public through undergraduate student research programs, press releases, and social media outlets.  The PI will also develop movies for planetariums through the California Academy of Sciences.<br/><br/>This systematic study will use adaptive optics instrumentation to refine the multiplicity rate of larger main-belt asteroids and will search for a relationship between an asteroid's multiplicity and its composition.  High angular resolution allows the shape models of these asteroids to be measured to unprecedented accuracy.  A study of the orbits of these moons (satellites) will constrain the bulk density of the primary asteroid and provide clues about the composition and distribution of its material, supporting studies addressing the formation of these multiple-asteroid systems in the Solar System."

New biosensing capabilities are needed for a paradigm shift in sensor design, from tailoring the sensor to fit a narrow range of targets and conditions, towards a more adaptable platform, wherein the sensor architecture is unvaried, while its performance is tuned to match a particular concentration and complexity of the biological analyte. This project aims to investigate and engineer a new generation of reconfigurable biosensor platforms that can be used to measure multiple circulating biomarkers and inform the development and analysis of microphysiological models. Microphysiological models replicate human organ function, and they are promising technologies for fundamental biological research and discovery of translatable biomarkers, pharmaceuticals, and regenerative therapies; however, due to the anatomical and cellular complexity of microphysiological models, a major challenge exists in measuring and analyzing the function and performance of such complex systems. Reconfigurable, multiplexed sensors will provide a new technique for the parallelization of monitoring microphysiological models, i.e. many microphysiological models and biomarkers can be operated, monitored, and analyzed simultaneously. Such a technology is poised to better our understanding of the fundamental development of any engineered large tissue, organ, or model. This knowledge will accelerate biotechnology research by reducing variability and providing more statistically powerful trials, better informing animal or clinical testing, and identifying new targets for investigation. The interdisciplinary nature of this project, combining microelectronics, microfluidics, data science, and tissue engineering will require equally interdisciplinary education and global engagement plan, which will be implemented by collaborating with high school STEM teachers through authentic summer research experiences and participating in the international SensUs Biosensors Research Competition for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to design, fabricate, and validate sensors for a reconfigurable, multiplexed microfluidic-microbalance system, which is comprised of an array of miniature quartz-crystal microbalances and integral microfluidics to characterize both biochemical and biophysical properties of microphysiological models. Specifically, the operational frequency, binding selectivity, and regeneration of the novel biosynthetic-recognition moieties will be investigated. Understanding these parameters will enable the microfluidic-microbalance platform to be reconfigured for different biomarkers; moreover, the multiplexed sensing can elucidate new correlations between sets of biomarkers and biological function. The proposed research will include (1) modelling of microfluidic delivery and operation of microfluidic-microbalance arrays in complex media, (2) microfabrication and experimental testing of sensor with novel biosynthetic-recognition elements, and (3) the development of the necessary hardware and computational algorithms to process the multiplexed data streams. To demonstrate these innovations, the sensors will be validated with a microphysiological model of human microvasculature to (1) extract, process, and biochemically analyze circulating media, (2) measure and correlate perfusion pressure and viscosity to microvascular development, and (3) harnesses these data streams to predict and optimize biological function of the model. This effort will be the foundation for new multiplexed sensing strategies to investigate microphysiological models and complex in vitro biological systems. Broadly, this research will illuminate a pathway for future research into innovative means of making sensors to monitor multiple biochemical analytes simultaneously, to be reconfigured for use in MPMs of different organs, and to generate data streams for the future development of machine learning methods to analyze and discover novel correlations between biomarkers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, there has been a surge in the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms on high dimensional data producing unstructured stochastic models. Such models tend to be of very high dimensions limiting their utility in various applications involving optimization or decision systems. This proposal focuses on developing a foundational theory for model reduction applied to classes of stochastic models, in particular, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); these are stochastic models that are described by underlying finite dimensional state space. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: Ultimately, a model reduction theory will impact many fundamental aspects related to complex stochastic models including simulation, prediction, coding, robust learning, decision design and reinforcement learning. This research will develop new insights to address similar questions for other stochastic models including jump linear systems, and graphical models with latent variables and will have a direct impact on problems related to artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning. The latter is emerging as a popular approach for many decision-systems applications involving social behavior-- where simple mechanistic models do not exist. Examples of such problems are critical infrastructures and smart services where high dimensional unstructured data is available in real time. Models emerging in such approaches tend to have very high dimensions. <br/><br/>A foundational theory for model reduction will affect the way we learn and utilize complex stochastic models. As a result, this development will enter our courses at MIT in a fashion similar to how model reduction theory impacted courses in linear system theory. The development should affect classes in stochastic models, machine learning, and statistical learning theory, reinforcement learning, and AI.  We also intend to incorporate the connection between model reduction and statistical learning in our new MIT micromasters in statistics and data science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the constituents of blood, white blood cells represent a particularly rich source of information due to their active involvement in the immune response of the body. As such, technologies that can rapidly characterize blood samples and extract reliable information are in ever-increasing demand for both clinical and basic research applications. The proposed work aims to develop smart microchips that can reliably analyze white blood cells from small blood samples without any sample preparation. These microchips will be low-cost, disposable, and will include built-in electrodes that can convert the chemical information from white blood cells into electrical signals to be interpreted by a smartphone and transmitted to the healthcare provider. The proposed research therefore has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling people to self-administer blood tests at home or in mobile settings. Besides his research, the PI is fully committed to the educational aspects of his profession and aspires to be a role model for next-generation engineers. The PI's educational goal is to create application-focused multidisciplinary courses, research opportunities and learning experiences for students. To this end, the PI proposes (1) to organize innovation tournaments to develop micro/nanotechnologies for solving biomedical challenges, (2) to implement a laboratory module in the graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, (3) to involve and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in conducting the research activities of this proposal, (4) to mentor high school teachers to attract K-12 and High School Students and underrepresented groups to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.<br/><br/>Despite being highly effective in manipulating cells, microfluidic devices lack native sensing schemes and hence often act as upstream sample preparation elements before quantitative measurements typically performed with a laboratory instrument. The disconnect between microfluidic manipulation and quantitative measurements is an important limitation that hampers the widespread adoption of these tools outside of academic research laboratories, for example in resource-limited or in point-of-care settings, where they can be truly transformative in healthcare delivery. The PI's career goal is to develop polymer-based lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms with built-in sensor networks, whose purposely simple hardware will be augmented by complex computational algorithms, to function as content-aware, autonomous microfluidic devices for quantitative cell analysis. To achieve this goal, the PI will adopt a highly multidisciplinary approach combining traditionally-distant disciplines such as microsystem engineering, information theory, data science, and biomedicine. This proposal will (1) design and fabricate plastic microfluidic chips wired with networks of<br/>interconnected electrical micro-sensors, each individually designed to produce a signature response that can be recognized among others through computation, (2) develop computational algorithms to process compressed data from the sensor network by utilizing both model-based signal processing and machine learning approaches, (3) develop open- and closed-loop controlled microfluidic systems, where a host of<br/>actuators are combined with spatiotemporal data generated by networked sensors to extract biological information from the sample under test, (4) combine all of the developed concepts to create an autonomous and adaptive microfluidic system that can analyze whole blood samples by label-free immunophenotyping of white blood cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The penetration of renewable energy is increasing and expected to reach 33% by 2020 in California. Uncertain nature of renewable energy generation is throwing up new challenges to manage uncertainty on a scale never seen before. Existing methods of managing uncertainty via adequate spinning reserves are uneconomical at such a large scale. Demand response programs will provide some mitigation, but will be inadequate. Any other solution deployed to manage this uncertainty is unlikely to be adopted, unless it is consistent with the economic laws at play. New market designs and pricing mechanisms have to be investigated that (i) facilitate renewable energy integration and demand side management in the smart grid and (ii) ensure sufficient grid stability margins. Towards this end, the theory of market for random goods will be developed and studied in the project where risk management policies, incentive structures for flexibility, and market design is studied in tandem. The proposed research effort is an essential part of developing the economics of the smart grid and a step towards renewable energy integration. The project trains the next generation of engineers and scientists to overcome challenges that the smart grid operators will encounter with large uncertainty in renewable generation.<br/><br/>Uncertainty in renewable generation provides incentives for generators and load serving entities to strategically distort prices in their favor. Thus, there is a need to introduce market mechanisms to restrict the ability of market players to distort prices. The key tools to designing a market for random goods are game theory and mechanism design, coupled with advances in probability theory and optimization/data science. New mechanisms will be developed by a three-pronged approach: <br/>(1) Introduce a new perspective of viewing renewable energy as a random good, i.e., a good that is only generated and delivered with some probability. The market for aggregators is introduced and studied for (i) designing market mechanisms for buying random goods that aggregators could sell in wholesale markets; (ii) designing market mechanisms for selling random goods that renewable generators could use; and (iii) designing market exchanges, where renewable energy could be traded. <br/>(2) Devise appropriate formats for expressing flexibility in demand and generation. This entails (i) designing appropriate pricing mechanisms to induce consumers to express maximum flexibility (this will be enforced and managed via the smart-meter infrastructure that utilities plan to put in place in the next few years); and (ii) designing mechanisms for economic dispatch wherein flexible generator receive incentive payments for their flexibility. <br/>(3) Develop a theory for risk mitigation and risk-awareness in economic dispatch. This entails (i) investigating the role of virtual bidding in risk mitigation in multi-stage markets; and (ii) rethinking risk-aware design for electricity markets from the ground-up by formalizing a risk-aware economic dispatch framework. The above research agenda requires foundational developments of new economic, optimization, and control frameworks that incorporate randomness, flexibility, and risk."

Such highly distributed structures expose the power grid to critical security vulnerabilities, such that malicious attackers bent on subverting grid operations can severely disrupt energy generation, transmission, and distribution. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a decision-theoretic approach that includes security as an integral part of design mechanisms in power grids, rendering inherently secure operations.<br/><br/>The key motivation underpinning this research is that current monitoring, protection, and control functions in power grid are designed without regard for inherent security, and security vulnerabilities are addressed as they are discovered. Therefore, while being effective against naturally occurring faults and attacks with known structures, they lack the versatility to counter highly structured and unknown cyber attacks. This research produces a decision-theoretic framework that integrates security assurance as a constraint in designing and optimizing monitoring and control modules while adopting realistic models for adversaries, and incorporating generation, transmission, and operational constraints. This framework facilitates analyzing the tradeoffs among three key measures involved in designing any operation in monitoring and control modules, namely: (i) security guarantees, (ii) quality the operation (through assigning appropriate performance measures that match the goals of the operations), and (iii) amenability to real-time and scalable implementation. These analytical results guide transformational approaches to secure monitoring and protection in future energy grids. These approaches are in contrast to the existing designs in which operations are optimized for attack-free settings, and are augmented by additional modules to enhance their resiliency against known classes of cyber attacks. The methods used to address these problems include mathematical statistics, statistical signal processing, optimization theory, and power engineering.<br/><br/>The educational component of this research is composed of several parts aimed at students ranging from the high school to graduate level, and from several demographics. In collaboration with the Engineering Ambassadors program at Rensselaer, this research program develops interactive presentations for high-school students about modern notions of cyber security, which involve undergraduate students as assistants in delivering these presentations, who will be also involved in research. Other educational components include designing curricular materials for graduate courses on the applications of modern data science in power grids."

The penetration of renewable energy is increasing and expected to reach 33% by 2020 in California. Uncertain nature of renewable energy generation is throwing up new challenges to manage uncertainty on a scale never seen before. Existing methods of managing uncertainty via adequate spinning reserves are uneconomical at such a large scale. Demand response programs will provide some mitigation, but will be inadequate. Any other solution deployed to manage this uncertainty is unlikely to be adopted, unless it is consistent with the economic laws at play. New market designs and pricing mechanisms have to be investigated that (i) facilitate renewable energy integration and demand side management in the smart grid and (ii) ensure sufficient grid stability margins. Towards this end, the theory of market for random goods will be developed and studied in the project where risk management policies, incentive structures for flexibility, and market design is studied in tandem. The proposed research effort is an essential part of developing the economics of the smart grid and a step towards renewable energy integration. The project trains the next generation of engineers and scientists to overcome challenges that the smart grid operators will encounter with large uncertainty in renewable generation.<br/><br/>Uncertainty in renewable generation provides incentives for generators and load serving entities to strategically distort prices in their favor. Thus, there is a need to introduce market mechanisms to restrict the ability of market players to distort prices. The key tools to designing a market for random goods are game theory and mechanism design, coupled with advances in probability theory and optimization/data science. New mechanisms will be developed by a three-pronged approach: <br/>(1) Introduce a new perspective of viewing renewable energy as a random good, i.e., a good that is only generated and delivered with some probability. The market for aggregators is introduced and studied for (i) designing market mechanisms for buying random goods that aggregators could sell in wholesale markets; (ii) designing market mechanisms for selling random goods that renewable generators could use; and (iii) designing market exchanges, where renewable energy could be traded. <br/>(2) Devise appropriate formats for expressing flexibility in demand and generation. This entails (i) designing appropriate pricing mechanisms to induce consumers to express maximum flexibility (this will be enforced and managed via the smart-meter infrastructure that utilities plan to put in place in the next few years); and (ii) designing mechanisms for economic dispatch wherein flexible generator receive incentive payments for their flexibility. <br/>(3) Develop a theory for risk mitigation and risk-awareness in economic dispatch. This entails (i) investigating the role of virtual bidding in risk mitigation in multi-stage markets; and (ii) rethinking risk-aware design for electricity markets from the ground-up by formalizing a risk-aware economic dispatch framework. The above research agenda requires foundational developments of new economic, optimization, and control frameworks that incorporate randomness, flexibility, and risk."

The technological advances are stimulating the rapid emergence of new-generation large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPS), including the smart grid, smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, medical device networks and mobile robotic networks. CPS consists of a large number of geographically dispersed entities and thus distributed data sharing is necessary to achieve network-wide goals. However, distributed data sharing also raises the significant concern that the private or confidential information of legitimate entities could be leaked to unauthorized entities. Privacy has become an issue of high priority to address before certain CPS can be widely deployed. Existing techniques to protect the data privacy of ICT systems are not sufficient to ensure CPS privacy. This project will develop new control-theoretic schemes to assure the successful completion of control tasks for large-scale CPS and simultaneously preserve the privacy of legitimate entities. The outcomes of this project will provide engineering guidelines to build trustworthy CPS in adversarial operating environments. The proposed activities on education and outreach will contribute to training an energetic generation of skilled professionals and engineers with multidisciplinary background to satisfy the rapid growth of CPS.<br/><br/>This project will systematically study CPS privacy from a fresh control-theoretic perspective. The proposed research will develop new schemes by leveraging technical tools of two disparate domains: (1) decision and control (control theory, optimization, game theory, distributed algorithms); (2) computer science (data privacy, cryptography). The new schemes will achieve mathematically provable privacy and control-theoretic performance. The research agenda consists of three thrusts: (i) developing new homomorphic encryption schemes to solve distributed optimization problems where the computation is carried over encrypted data; (ii) designing feedback perturbations on the inputs and outputs of dynamic networks such that network privacy is protected, system utilities; e.g., controllability, are maintained, and the costs caused by the perturbations are minimized; and (iii) evaluating the developed theory using the case studies of power systems, smart buildings and machine learning. The project will involve collaborations with research laboratories in federal, military and industrial sectors. The collaborations will promote technology transfer and make an impact beyond academia. The successful completion of this research will discover the unique role dynamic systems play in CPS privacy, provide the new understandings of the interplay between control theory and data privacy, and enable CPS to operate in a trustworthy manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cascading outages happen occasionally and can cause widespread blackouts, with up to tens of millions of people affected. The risk of cascading blackouts is present and could even increase because of the aging of power system infrastructure, severe weather events, increased variability due to the integration of renewable energy sources, and new threats such as cyber and physical attacks. Given the tremendous economic and societal impacts of blackouts, it is imperative to model and monitor the interactions and propagation of cascading outages, as well as develop effective mitigation techniques to reduce the risk of their occurrence. The causes of cascading outages are diverse and very complicated. However, the large amount of historical outage data collected by electric utilities provides an opportunity for new analysis of cascading outages. This project will use this data to understand the propagation and interactions of cascading outages, advance the monitoring of high-risk operating conditions, and provide engineering principles to reduce outage propagation. The research contributes to the grand national challenge of improving resilience of critical infrastructure systems by enhancing the resilience of power transmission and distribution grids against cascading blackouts. The project provides unique multi-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students that combine research work and education.<br/><br/>The project will pioneer data-based approaches for extracting insights and actionable information from the considerable data already available to utilities. The outage data will be clustered using big data learning techniques to reveal patterns of similar outages. New models will characterize key aspects of complicated outage interactions. For example, how outages affect one another will be expressed as a network of interactions between power grid components. Data will be used to identify observable correlates of high-risk cascading conditions from the historical data, so that mitigation schemes for cascading events can be applied only when needed. Finally, the new models and data will be used to develop a framework for effective monitoring and mitigation. Since large transmission blackouts are high risk due to their catastrophic impact on society, and the smaller distribution blackouts are frequent, the research team will analyze outage dependencies and cascading using recorded data from both the transmission and distribution power grids. Prototype software will be developed for processing data, identifying model parameters and key metrics, and performing risk-based and data-driven analysis of cascading outages. The project integrates engineering and science approaches from data analysis, risk analysis, complex networks, and power systems engineering to mitigate blackout risk."

Despite remarkable progress, miniature gas sensors still remain incapable of measuring gas quantity precisely because of issues in response drift, saturation, and limited specificity. This project proposes the development of a sensing mechanism that addresses such issues by investigating unexplored fluidic phenomena in the micro-domain and by demonstrating a microfluidic sensor. The proposed research will provide a new paradigm in gas sensing and quantification and will have a broad range of societal impacts in numerous fields, including occupational safety regulation, environmental sciences, personal and community behavioral sciences, homeland security, chemical   manufacturing, and health science. In this context, the proposed project will provide a foundation for highly inter-disciplinary research and education, where students are exposed to broadly connected societal values among engineering, science, medicine, social sciences, and public policy. This program will also provide an opportunity to reach out to the K-12 community in collaboration with a local museum; to industry via intellectual property generation directed toward commercialization; and to the undergraduate and graduate students via class development on important advances in novel sensing mechanisms and microfluidics principles. <br/><br/>b) Technical Abstract: <br/>This project aims (1) to establish a novel class of a gas sensing principle by investigating the science of microfluidic bubble formation and (2) to fabricate a bubble-based sensor which improves gas sensing performance by two orders of magnitude in comparison to existing counterparts. Specifically, this project will investigate the microfluidic gas/liquid interface properties of various gas types via microfabricated structures. An optimized prototype of a high performance gas sensor will be microfabricated to demonstrate high-precision gas quantification. By combining the fundamental science studies with experimental data, the proposed research is expected to establish fundamental and comprehensive understanding on bubble formation phenomena in the microfluidic domain, in relation to gas-liquid interfacial parameters. Such an understanding will enable this program to further demonstrate a high-precision micro gas sensor device that is capable of quantifying gas amounts with outstanding dynamic range, resolution, and linearity."

These data, once generated, cascade through the information storage lifecycle -- from primary storage media in the form of hard disks and solid-state drives to archival media such as magnetic tape. While innovations in information density, stability, and energy consumption routinely occur, existing memory materials are approaching their physical and economic finish lines. As imagined by the Semiconductor Synthetic Biology (SemiSynBio) Roadmap, DNA-based massive information storage is a brand new start for memory manufacturing. As a result, the research team proposes to pioneer a cold storage paradigm by designing, building, and testing two accessible, editable, and non-volatile memory technologies made from DNA. Inspired by DNA circuits and made possible by state-of-the-art optical physics, the team will: (1) biologically synthesize DNA molecules, (2) engineer substrates made from said molecules, (3) write digital information onto the substrates using additional DNA molecules, (4) minimize encoding and decoding errors using computer science algorithms, and (5) read, as well as edit digital information onto the substrates using reversible DNA binding. In full support of this interdisciplinary project, the research team includes expertise in: DNA nanotechnology, nanoscale characterization, optical physics, biologically-inspired algorithms, and synthetic biology. Modeled after the faculty collaboration, a new cadre of students will work and study at the confluence of the biological, computational, and engineering sciences in anticipation of the emerging field called Nucleic Acid Memory (NAM). As active participants in and co-owners of a Vertically Integrated Project called NAM, undergraduate and graduate students will enroll into a multi-year and multi-disciplinary research team that provides ongoing course and teaching credit.<br/><br/>The focal points of this proposal are two storage medium prototypes, digital Nucleic Acid (dNAM) and sequence Nucleic Acid Memory (seqNAM). Each offer a novel approach to coding information using DNA, and both use super-resolution microscopy to read information. In dNAM, information is encoded into defined spatial arrangements of DNA sequences on top of addressable DNA origami nanostructures, called NAM storage nodes. DNA origami provides a convenient pathway and a proven approach to high-yield and rapid prototyping of NAM node structures. Staple strands will be extended from the NAM node structures with a unique sequence for site-specific attachment of NAM data strands. When bound, data strands serve as docking sites for complementary data imager strands, which are employed in a DNA-based form of super-resolution microscopy (SRM) called DNA-PAINT. DNA PAINT is a stochastic super-resolution imaging technique that uses repetitive, transient binding of fluorescently labeled data imager strands to circumvent the diffraction limit of light. Thus, data imager strands act as the read head and reveal the state of each site of the NAM storage node with better than 7 nm resolution. Binary states at each data cell can be defined by the presence (1) or absence (0) of the NAM data strand, as determined by SRM. Increasing site-specific bit-density from 1 to 3 bits can be simply achieved by multiple orthogonal sequences. Editing of data strands is performed by either adding a required data strand to a vacant data cell or by removing an existing data strand via toehold-mediated strand displacement. Built upon a similar storage node platform, seqNAM employs two data cells to arrange data strands into ordered arrays. In seqNAM, information is encoded within portions of the data strands that remain single stranded. The sequences of the data strands are read using a multi-color super-resolution sequencing (SRS) process that uses a library of locked nucleic acid imager strands. Editing is performed by removing the target data strands with complementary sequences using toehold-mediated strand invasion and then adding the replacement data strands. seqNAM exceeds dNAM by storing information within DNA sequences at a potentially higher density. In addition, it creates a new enzyme-free sequencing platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the distribution system accounts for over 75% of the outages in the power grid, power system operators currently have limited situational awareness at the distribution level, limited visibility beyond the substations, limited information on the network and its connectivity.  With the rapid increase in amount and type of data accumulated in the distribution system, i.e. from Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and remotely monitored and controlled devices, the need to glean actionable intelligence from it is of paramount importance. Integrating data from these heterogeneous datasets (Geographical Information System (GIS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), AMI, Outage and Distribution Management Systems (OMS/DMS)) is a first step towards achieving this.  The goal of this project is to develop a visual analytics platform to leverage the integrated dataset, enabling distribution system operators to visualize and analyze the state of the distribution system over time, empowering them to identify categorical patterns of events in space and time via highly coordinated visualizations. The project comprises three main components: 1. A data-driven approach to uncover useful information from streaming and historical data, strengthened by 2. Situationally-aware modeling and simulation of the electric power distribution system, and 3. A visual analytics system, leading to prescriptive analytics, actionable knowledge for the indispensable human in-the-loop.  The developed infrastructure would enable and enhance real-time fast and confident decision-making, thus supporting overall efficiency and reliability improvements in the electric power distribution system, reducing current outage times and improving reliability indices. Benefits would accrue in terms of savings as well as in terms of customer satisfaction. The principal investigator of this project is the founder and faculty advisor of the local student chapter of IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) and she plans to leverage that connection to broaden participation in this project.  <br/><br/>For complete situational awareness leading to decision-making, there needs to be powerful, automated analytics, enhanced by a deep understanding of the physical system, but it is also essential that the human be placed in the loop at the right place and time. For this reason, three components are integrated: 1. Data-driven real-time probabilistic outage prediction, coupled with 2. Situationally-aware modeling and simulation of the distribution system, and with 3. An interactive visual analytics system to provide visual and exploratory analytics.  Utilizing real-time data streams coming from the distribution system (SCADA, AMI, Digital Fault Recorders) and from weather stations, together with historical data, advanced real-time data analytics algorithms are applied to strategically process the data, obtaining, for example, accurate loading conditions and developing probabilistic outage predictions. This sensed and processed information is then utilized, as needed, by the now situationally-aware distribution system electrical model to perform simulations. The simulations in turn provide input feedback to probabilistic scenarios and define system constraints for the analytics modules. Since human-in-the-loop is important, these analytics are closely coupled to the representations and modes of interaction in the interactive visual analytics system so that the right information is presented to the user at the right time. Thus, the developed framework results in a hybrid approach that leverages data-driven methodologies, the physical system, and visual analytics, to provide much improved decision-making capabilities.  This project investigates the science of real-time learning and decision-making, while also looking closely at the technology for data-driven distribution system analysis coupled with deep understanding of the physical system. The project will provide theoretical underpinnings and novel methods to significantly move distribution modernization efforts forward, including improvements in system reliability and resiliency, new modes for management, new paradigms and paths for customer-utility cooperation, and a new approach to handling big data in the electric grid.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A probabilistic spatiotemporal scenario data-driven framework will then be developed for multi-scale sequential control of networked engineering systems under uncertainty. The algorithms and tools developed will be used to sculpt optimal power profiles for power electronics converters in a DC distribution network and help mitigate the adverse effects of intermittent sources, uncertain load demand, or faults.<br/> <br/>The project represents a radical departure from the exiting big data and decision-making research, toward developing autonomous decision-making under uncertainty constructs for systems of growing scales and time critical mission requirements.  Algorithms and tools developed can be extended to other smart and connected domains, e.g., air traffic management, networked traffic platoons, and sensor networks. US microgrid capacity is expected to reach 4.3 GW by 2020. DC distribution networks are emerging alternatives to AC distribution ones, and are critical to the scalable integration of renewable energy resources and electrified transportation fleets. Research results will be ported into topics in reinforcement learning, optimal control, networked control systems, data-driven analysis and decision-making, and power electronics systems. This project synergizes research activities between University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) and Texas A&M-Corpus Christi (TAMUCC), both HBCU/MI Hispanic Serving Institutions, and involves students from Electrical Engineering and Computer Science backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large variety of real-world data sources such as speech and audio,<br/>biomedical signals, health care records, network-traffic and stock market data etc. manifest as time-series<br/>and their analysis is of significant interest to both government and industry. The explosion of such <br/>data sources has only been exacerbated by the digital revolution, viz. the generous amount of audio-video<br/>streams on the internet, the storage of large amounts of chronological health care records in electronic<br/>databases and the continuous generation of new time-series data from advances in sensing. Automated software<br/>tools that can find patterns in a large time-series sequence, help in fast and scalable retrieval, and<br/>categorize large time-series collections are hence highly desirable. The proposed research is in developing <br/>such software (algorithmic)tools with a particular focus on robustness and scalability. The problem of <br/>robustness refers to the fact that time-series that may have the ""same appeal"" to a human consumer, e.g. <br/>different versions of the same song/video, may not necessarily be digitally identical. Hence, robust <br/>techniques are needed that can withstand distortions which do not change the essence of the time-series <br/>content. Scalability requires that the pattern-matching techniques be fast and easy to implement, so that<br/>the solutions can be deployed to mine large collections. Further, to prepare the next generation of<br/>engineers in electrical engineering and computer science, the project includes a strong educational<br/>component. At the heart of this educational component is an edutainment game where a human player, i.e.<br/>students with varying levels of academic preparation (high-school, undergraduate and graduate), compete <br/>against a computer algorithm in a video piracy challenge. The game is aimed at making the learning <br/>process more interactive, particularly for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>A serious practical challenge in mining time-series data for emerging applications is the ability to<br/>withstand distortions - that is often instances of the ""same underlying"" time series are observed<br/>under noise, amplitude and/or time scaling and other miscellaneous operations. Many existing<br/>techniques for time-series comparisons do not enable distortion robustness and the ones that do,<br/>often come at a substantial computational cost. Further, existing algorithmic techniques enable<br/>control of key properties of time-series features such as robustness and uniqueness only at an<br/>intuitive, often heuristic level. The proposed research advocates judicious selection of time-series<br/>extrema and aims to break the classical trade-off between computational efficiency in time-series<br/>feature extraction and comparison vs. enabling robustness to distortions. Unlike existing methods,<br/>which employ pre-processing time-series filters ""inspired"" from intuition, explicit optimization of the<br/>filter is proposed in the sense of cost functions that capture key feature attributes such as robustness<br/>and uniqueness of the extracted extrema. Optimal extrema extraction will be investigated in two<br/>different setups: a.) a deterministic framework where example training time-series are used in the<br/>optimization, and b.) a statistical framework where stochastic models on time-series are used. A<br/>variety of related sub-problems also emerge, namely: a.) connections to edge detection problems<br/>in image processing and vision, b.) encoding and comparisons of time-series extrema, and c.)<br/>extensions to finding robust extrema under non-linear operations on the time-series. The research<br/>plan is to juxtapose the development of the algorithmic tools with two real-world applications: 1.)<br/>multimedia fingerprinting, and 2.) bio-medical time series analysis. Additionally, software tools<br/>namely edutainment games will be developed based on these applications which will play a crucial<br/>role in enhancing the PI's research and classroom teaching. Dissemination of research results will be<br/>done via articles in leading Journals and conferences, and via online MATLAB software toolboxes."

One important exception to this trend is in the field of material science where progress in creating new classes of materials and advancing the use of existing systems is hampered by the lack of validated computational models. Of particular interest in this proposal are structural polycrystalline metals, of central importance in the automotive, aircraft, and energy industries, where the processes of fatigue and fracture pose significant modeling and computational challenges. To resolve these issues, dynamic high-energy X-ray diffraction (HEXD) experiments have recently come on line that are capable of probing the internal evolution of samples of these materials in real time as they are subject to processing or service conditions.  The resulting data sets are both large (up to 10Tb for a single experiment) and complex thereby complicating their analysis and integration within the material design process.  Even with extensive human interaction, state-of-the-art computational tools can extract only a tiny fraction of the full information contained in these data sets.   Realizing the potential offered by these data and models requires fundamentally new Big Data-type of computational methods.  The work in this project is aimed at developing such a tool set. <br/> <br/>Of specific concern in this project are the use and extension of sophisticated, probabilistic, video processing methods as the basis for addressing a pressing problem in the analysis of dynamic HEXD data. The physics of X-ray diffraction from polycrystalline samples gives rise to data sets comprised of temporally evolving collections of localized structures, referred to as ""spots,"" in a three-dimensional data space. Use of these data in conjunction with computational plasticity codes requires that these spots be associated with individual grains in the polycrystal and that these sets of evolving structures be tracked over time. To date, the only tools for addressing this indexing problem are static in nature and function best for cases where the material sample is in a pristine state. Similarities between this dynamic indexing problem and the problem of identifying and tracking objects moving in a video scene motivate the adaptation and further development of a multi-hypothesis tracking approach developed by the PI team to the analysis of HEXD data. The method is based on the construction of a conditional random field over a large set of hypotheses capturing ways in which spots can be associated with one. Estimation of the optimal tracks and association is carried out using efficient graph cut methods making the overall approach well suited to near real time implementation. The existing work in this field will be extended through the construction of dynamic models for the evolution of features associated with the spots (e.g., centroid location, low order moments) based on existing plasticity codes and incorporation of these models into the random field to achieve a multiple model, multi-hypothesis tracking approach for dynamic HEXD data."

Numerous real-time data of different types, different components, and various locations are generated to monitor and control power grids. Currently, the control of large-scale power grids is still mainly based on the physical system model, while the hidden knowledge in the abovementioned large-volume data has not been fully exploited. This project selects one typical control function in smart grids, low-frequency oscillation control, to explore the potential to enhance smart grid controls using the hidden knowledge. <br/>Low-frequency oscillation is a common phenomenon in operation of large-scale power systems. If not controlled properly, these oscillations may degrade power system security and make a large number of customers lose their power. This project aims at developing an intelligent controller to mitigate these low-frequency oscillations using data and machine learning technologies. If successful, it will advance the technology in smart grid, and remove obstacles for application of machine learning technologies in smart grid control. The proposed approach will contribute to more secure, reliable and economic operations of U.S. power grids. For example, the risk of blackout can be significantly mitigated; and thus outage cost could be saved, e.g., more than $1 billion for U.S. western grid collapse in 1996. The proposed project is also coupled with a broad dissemination of research findings and a strong educational component to engage students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The proposed research effort focuses on a completely new design methodology of intelligent oscillation damping control using the data-driven models. These data-driven models of power grids derive from synchronized measurement data using machine learning technologies, in conjunction with power grid domain knowledge. Specifically, this project will: (1) build a self-evolving dynamic knowledge base based on historical measurement data under different oscillation scenarios; (2) extract the critical features from historical and real-time data, and select the optimal features to improve data-driven model prediction accuracy; (3) develop machine learning algorithms to predict data-driven models for oscillation damping control design; and (4) validate and demonstrate the proposed methodology via computer simulations and hardware testbed experiments. This advanced approach will contribute to the energy security and efficiency of the U.S. electric power grids. This project will expose both undergraduate and graduate students to the state-of-the-art machine learning education and workforce training program. By coordinating with an established outreach program in an existing NSF/DOE engineering research center, the research results will be integrated into weekly seminars and short courses that are accessible to four partner universities, nine affiliate universities and more than 35 industry partners. Moreover, this project will encourage students to get involved with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses early in their pre-college years to prepare for STEM careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims at developing models and software tools to provide guidance for the smart and preventive operation of power systems, using available weather forecast data. It is anticipated that the developed tools will better estimate the impacts of hurricanes on the electric power grid and identify operation strategies that are resilient to the damages induced by the hurricane. Ultimately, the outcomes of this project will help reduce the size and duration of power blackouts during hurricanes. The avoided blackout costs can save the U.S. economy hundreds of millions to several billion dollars each year. This is an interdisciplinary research project, where electrical engineering, civil engineering, and atmospheric science students will closely collaborate and broaden their skill sets, thus advancing their education and empowering the nation's trained workforce.<br/><br/>This project exploits the availability of weather forecast data to guide preventive power system operation during hurricanes.  Currently, weather forecast data is not systematically integrated into the power system operation and, thus, preventive operation is not possible. The current research approaches employ an integrated framework, mainly based on physical and engineering models, which uses the hurricane forecast information to predict the component damage scenarios for the power system. The preventive operation decisions are, then, determined with stochastic optimization, through explicit modeling of the damage scenarios. The existing models have two main shortcomings: 1) they ignore the weather forecast uncertainties; and 2) they are extremely computationally demanding. There are substantial levels of inherent uncertainties in weather forecast data and component damage models, which affect both the effectiveness of the final preventive operation strategies as well as the model?s computational efficiency. Moreover, the computational time in real-time power system operation is extremely limited. The hypothesis governing this project is that a hybrid approach, which exploits the availability of data, while also relying on physical and engineering principles, can overcome the two challenges, mentioned above. First, using historical and real-time data, this project reduces uncertainties in order to improve both the solution quality and the computational needs. Second, by applying machine learning techniques on synthetic, historical, and real-time data, the project replaces computationally-demanding stochastic optimization with effective proxy deterministic models, to achieve computational tractability for real-time operation. Thus, this project will enable, for the first time, appropriate integration of uncertain weather forecast data within power system operation during hurricanes, to quickly identify effective preventive operation strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All of this had led to an unprecedented variety of wireless services that changes the way that people are working, interacting, and spending their spare time. However, the continued increase in data rates has also created great challenges, since the spectrum used for signal transmission is a limited and precious resource. For this reason, it is essential to both use new spectrum, and to exploit available spectrum as efficiently as possible. Advances in chip manufacturing have opened the possibility for low-cost communications systems using millimeter waves, which have much shorter wavelength than currently used cellular systems, and where a lot of spectrum is available. Still, given the increase in data usage, also this spectrum has to be used efficiently.<br/><br/>One way to drastically improve spectral efficiency is to transmit multiple data streams together, using the same spectrum. However, in a normal setting, the receiver obtains then a mixture of those data streams, and they would interfere with each other. It is thus necessary to transmit the data streams in a way that allows the receiver to disentangle them. This project investigates a recently discovered such transmission method that is especially suitable for wireless links where the transmitter and receiver can see each other, and are fixed - such situations can occur, e.g., for wireless backhaul (essentially, the connection from the base station to the internet), or wireless communication between servers in a data center. The method transmits different data streams on waves that have different orbital angular momenta (OAM), which describe the phase twist of a propagating wave. The current project investigates the fundamental science, as well as potential practical problems of OAM systems, and aims to assess their potential as a revolutionary method for drastically improving speed and efficiency of wireless data connections.<br/><br/>To make the above description more precise, OAM describes a phase twist of a propagating wave, and is different from the well-known polarization. Beams with different OAM are orthogonal to each other when propagating along the same beam axis, so that beams emanating from the same aperture, using the same time-frequency resources, can carry independent data streams. The project investigates the fundamentals as well as the real-world behavior of OAM multiplexing systems operating in the millimeter wave frequency range, specifically, 1) Explore the basic factors limiting OAM communication system capacity, in particular the pathloss of different OAM beams, and investigate measures to optimize the system capacity; 2) Investigate fundamental issues of OAM beam propagation, including the impact of attenuation and mode conversion by specular reflection and diffuse scattering; 3) Evaluate residual crosstalk between OAM channels, arising from various propagation environments; 4) Find new methods for compensating OAM channel degradation, in particular compensating for multipath propagation and atmospheric distortions; and 5) Analyze the connection between OAM and spatial multiplexing, and see how they can be combined in a manner that is most beneficial for implementation."

These new robots are capable of general field mobility and are being programmed to think like assistant field geologists in order to develop research strategies in rugged natural environments where measurements are lacking.

Field performance of the resulting human-robot teams will be evaluated according to criteria assessing the degree of robotic mobility and autonomy, the quality and reliability of the resulting geoscientific measurements, and the impact of the collection process on the sampled environment. Advances in legged robot mechanics and intelligent control have brought the field to a threshold where the next major challenges for autonomous mobility can only be formulated and engaged with respect to suites of abstract but formal tasks relative to unstructured environments against which the appropriateness and success of autonomously generated, goal-directed motor behaviors can be precisely measured.<br/>Robots endowed with even the rudiments of understanding what measurements are needed where and when by scientists, in order to test their hypotheses, would deepen our insight into the structure of human cognition.

Ideally, this technology could be quickly written, read, or erased, and would last indefinitely in any defined state. However, current technologies have limited lifetimes, are often arduous to write, consume significant amounts of power, and are not capable of sustaining the current global data growth. Biological systems on the other hand, solved this problem billions of years ago using deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) coupled with enzymatic methods for reading, writing, and erasing the data. In fact, the average human writes 40 exabytes of data each day while consuming comparatively little energy. Moreover, this data can be stored for hundreds or thousands of years. Thus, DNA represents a unique and interesting platform for developing memory technologies for the next generation of electronic devices. However, in order to leverage its phenomenal storage capabilities and become a viable memory technology contender, a number of important technical and fundamental hurdles must be examined and overcome. As an initial step toward this goal, this proposal aims to create a DNA-based Read-Only Memory (ROM) that can be patterned, placed, and programmed as desired, can be read electrically, and is capable of interfacing with conventional semiconductor electronics for long-term data storage and retrieval. To achieve this goal, we have established a collaborative, multidisciplinary team working at the nexus of biological systems electrical and computer engineering and charge transport physics. This Team has expertise in the control and assembly of DNA nanostructures, nano- and molecular electronic systems, and the theory and modeling of nanoscale electronic devices. Together, this team will work with students and junior researchers to understand and control the charge transport properties of DNA-based nanostructures, to assemble DNA-based memory devices and circuits, to develop tools for modeling and programming these systems, and to train a new generation of scientists and engineers capable of working at the interface between biology and nano/electrical engineering.

The cumulative effects of these disturbed environments also threaten human well-being through damage of habitation and disruption of transportation. An interdisciplinary collaboration of geoscience, cognitive science, and robotics researchers aims to accelerate and deepen the collection of data about the fluid and materials properties associated with such unstable soils by endowing legged robots with the instrumentation and scientific agenda of agile, novice field assistants. These new robots are capable of general field mobility and are being programmed to think like assistant field geologists in order to develop research strategies in rugged natural environments where measurements are lacking. Overcoming the specific locomotion challenges presented by these environments and developing algorithms and software sufficient to interpret and act on human research needs will greatly advance the field of robotics. The resulting new information about wind, water and materials processes will have bearing on the management of infrastructure and agriculture, and also the response of landscapes to environmental changes.<br/><br/>The project focus is to use the geosciences field research setting to test a chain of hypotheses reaching from the formal representation of scientific knowledge to the properties of provably correct algorithms for human-machine pursuit of scientific data. The geoscientific goal is to produce the first comprehensive, time varying maps of soil strength with co-located soil moisture composition and size over the course of rainfall events in a natural landscape. The cognitive science goal is to develop a formalized representation of the cognitive processes underlying field data collection and interpretation that is simultaneously suitable to underlie robotic field assistance algorithms while at the same time advancing the study of human perceptual interpolation and reasoning. The robotics goal is to achieve a provably correct architecture for generating from formalized human task specification a chain of safe, stable online automated legged gait transitions on complex broken terrain that subserve the geoscientist data collection objectives. Two different families of legged robots with a variety of perceptual and geoscientific instrumentation suites will be deployed over natural hillsides under investigation by human geoscientists. Field performance of the resulting human-robot teams will be evaluated according to criteria assessing the degree of robotic mobility and autonomy, the quality and reliability of the resulting geoscientific measurements, and the impact of the collection process on the sampled environment. Advances in legged robot mechanics and intelligent control have brought the field to a threshold where the next major challenges for autonomous mobility can only be formulated and engaged with respect to suites of abstract but formal tasks relative to unstructured environments against which the appropriateness and success of autonomously generated, goal-directed motor behaviors can be precisely measured. Robots endowed with even the rudiments of understanding what measurements are needed where and when by scientists, in order to test their hypotheses, would deepen our insight into the structure of human cognition. They would also open the way toward collecting massive amounts of data at presently unachievably fine spatiotemporal scales, potentially transforming the theoretical and empirical foundations of geoscience."

In this program, the principle investigator (PI) is planning to create and evaluate novel energy efficient electronic devices based on a new hybrid material platform consisting of two-dimensional (2D) materials (mono-/di-chalcogenides and graphene) and ferroelectric metal oxides (doped hafnium and zirconium oxides). The ferroelectric metal oxides provide programmable and non-volatile doping in 2D materials, while the atomically thin bodies in 2D materials enable strong electrostatic control over the channel by the ferroelectric metal oxides. Most previous research on 2D/ferroelectric hybrid materials has focused on traditional perovskite ferroelectric materials. This proposed work will undertake the first systematic study of 2D materials on newly discovered ferroelectric hafnium and zirconium oxides, which have the advantages of excellent scalability, high coercive field, and full compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The PI's team will investigate the synthesis of this new hybrid material platform and create ultra-low power logic, memory, and analog devices based on these materials. The low power logic and memory devices based on these materials will be essential for mobile devices, medical implantable devices, wearable electronics, and large data centers. Analog classifiers based on these materials will enable high speed and low power signal processing and image recognition systems. 3D integration of these low power 2D ferroelectric devices with high speed silicon circuits will result in next-generation highly parallel and ultra-low power systems to support ""Big Data"" applications such as the Internet of Things and social media. The PI will integrate research and teaching by creating a new graduate/undergraduate course on 2D materials to train the next generation workforce in nanoelectronics. The PI will establish several outreach activities including a new ""Little Einstein"" science education program for elementary students to cultivate young minds at an early age to respect and embrace a career in science and technology. The PI will also establish a ""Girls Go Tech"" program for middle school girls to promote enrollment of female students in science and engineering programs.<br/>Technical description:<br/>The objective of the proposed research is to establish the foundation for a new research direction: nanoelectronics based on 2D/ferroelectric metal oxides hybrid material platform. The PI's team will synthesize and characterize 2D/ferroelectric metal oxide stacks, seeking fundamental understanding of the ferroelectric phase transition in metal oxides with 2D materials as substrate/capping layers. The team will also utilize these materials to create energy efficient logic, memory, and analog devices. Specifically, the team will create and evaluate novel 2D ferroelectric tunneling field effect transistors (2D Fe-TFETs) to serve as ultra-low power logic; will investigate 2D ferroelectric hafnium oxide transistors (2D FHOT) to implement highly energy efficient, scalable, and durable ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM); will create embedded-gate graphene ferroelectric transistors (EGGFTs) to realize highly energy-efficient, extremely compact, and non-volatile analog classifiers. These devices will then be stacked layer-by-layer to realize 3D monolithic integration. This research will elucidate the device physics and evaluate the potential of these devices for future semiconductor technology. The resulting 3D integrated system will provide the hardware foundation for new circuit and architecture designs. This research is potentially transformative as it may unlock new lines of research and development in energy efficient devices, circuits, and architectures with a broad range of emerging applications from wearable electronics and implantable medical devices to data centers."

The inexorable growth in the role of information in society will place an increasing burden on the US energy economy. Aggregate energy used for information technology constitutes a genuine, looming energy crisis in information processing. At the most fundamental level, the energy used to manipulate a single bit of information is currently a million times greater than theoretical limits. In order to address this issue, there is a critical need for fundamental and conceptual breakthroughs in the underlying physics, chemistry and materials science that form the foundation of information-processing technologies. This Science and Technology Center for Energy Efficient Electronics Science (E3S) seeks to approach the fundamental physical limits and engineering realization of electronic devices and systems for digital information- processing technologies. The Center for E3S proposes to research revolutionary concepts, and scientific principles that would enable fundamentally new and different science for digital-information processing, in order to achieve a radical reduction in energy usage.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Current technology is dependent on the transistor, which suffers from a serious voltage-dependent limitation, since it requires a powering voltage close to 1 Volt, whereas the wires of an electronic circuit will function with tolerable signal-to-noise ratio, even at voltages as low as 1 millivolt.  If the operating voltage is reduced by a factor of one thousand, than power will be reduced by a factor of one million.  Hence, the energy per bit-function in digital electronics is currently one million times higher than it needs to be. New science that would enable a millivolt electronic switch will lead to a successor to the conventional transistor, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift in digital electronics. Currently, CMOS dissipates a minimum of about 30,000 eV per digital function.  The 2007 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors projects a goal for this value to be reduced to about 800 eV per digital function by the Year 2022.  To address this revolutionary challenge, an interdisciplinary team of scientists from UC Berkeley, MIT and Stanford University will assemble in E3S to conduct research in four interrelated themes: I. Nanoelectronics: solid-state millivolt switching; 2. Nanomechanics: zero-leakage switching; 3. Nanomagnetics: surpassing the Landauer Limit; and 4. Nanophotonics: few-photon optical communication, for the common goal of new energy-efficient device architectures.<br/><br/>The central idea behind Theme 1 is to change the operational paradigm for the logic switch by controlling the width of the energy barrier rather than the height. Conduction occurs via tunneling of electrons, and it can be shown that this type of device can be operated at very low supply voltages and with very low off-currents. Theme 2 is focused on the design of nanoelectromechanical switches that will have zero off-state leakage current. To overcome contact wear and reliability issues, two novel switching device structures are proposed; one with an interface material between electrodes as they close; and one that uses a complementary configuration to obtain very-low-energy switching. Theme 3 seeks to surmount the Landauer Limit of 18 meV energy dissipation per logic operation at room temperature by using nanomagnetic devices. Electrical control of ferromagnetism, as compared to an external magnetic field, is proposed as an energy-efficient alternative. Theme 4 seeks to use nanophotonics for ultra-low-energy communications to approach the physical energy limits for intra and inter-chip communication between devices. A new form of spontaneous emission of light will be explored that is potentially superior to conventional stimulated emission. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Many programs at the participating institutions (UC Berkeley, MIT, and Stanford and with three minority-serving institutions: Contra Costa College (CCC), Los Angeles Trade Technical College (LATTC), and Tuskegee University, international collaboration with Oxford University, the University of Toronto and the University Hong Kong and industrial partnerships with Intel, IBM, Google, Lam Research and Hewlett Packard) will be leveraged to integrate research and education programs.  Among these are pre-college programs including: Summer High School Apprenticeship Program for rising high school seniors (UC Berkeley), Pre-College Engineering Academy for 11th and 12th grade high school students (UC Berkeley), Saturday Engineering Enrichment and Discovery Program (MIT), Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science Program at the undergraduate level (MIT), the Transfer-To-Excellence Program for community college students (UC Berkeley), E3S Center Summer Research Program for community college students, the Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at UC Berkeley, and the MIT Summer Research Program for minority students. A Graduate Student Council will be formed to develop student leadership skills. A Graduate Student Rotation Program will benefit students as well as enhance synergy among the four proposed research themes.  At the postgraduate level, university postdoctoral fellows programs will be leveraged to recruit minority and female faculty.  The Center plans to disseminate research results and activities to a broader audience to increase energy awareness through weekly energy forums and monthly lectures in the San Francisco Bay area, and plans to implement a comprehensive evaluation and assessment plan for the Center?s research and education activities."

Over the past twenty years, we have witness a dramatic rise of information in which the analysis of such systems invariably present challenging big data complexity issues.  For example, in transferring resources and information, a key requirement is the ability to adapt and reconfigure in response to structural and dynamic changes while avoiding disruption of service. To this end, we propose to develop fundamental relationships between network functionality and certain topological and geometric properties of the corresponding graph. The thematic vision for this program is based on the recently discovered fact that the geometric notion of curvature (or how objects deviate from being flat) is positively correlated with a systems functional robustness or its ability to adapt to dynamic changes.  While the developed theory and tools will be applicable to a broad set of dynamical systems, we will focus on cancer biology and man-made distributed malware. The accomplishments of this research will be disseminated through raising engineering awareness of the proposed research through K-12 outreach, publications, tutorials in the form of open-source software, and developed workshops. Specifically, given the rise of data (network) science, there is an increasing demand for engineers especially in national security areas where U.S. Veterans may serve an integral role.  As such, we will work to directly engage veterans to engage in aspects of the proposed research while also providing vet dependent mentoring for better university preparation.<br/><br/>This said, to accomplish these goals, the proposed research program aims to study the intimate connections between discrete geometry, optimal mass transport, entropy, and control to formulate new approaches to quantify and predict dynamical properties of complex networks at varying scales.  System properties include, but not limited to, robustness, heterogeneity, and congestion. As such, this research fills a need by investigating network functionality through the confluent study of geometry and control that relies upon several observations with far reaching physical (statistical mechanics) and information theoretic significance. Specifically, by placing a probability structure on a graph, the advantage over existing methods is that the space of probabilities on graphs has much nicer properties than the underlying discrete space alone. The associated probability measures can then be endowed with a Riemannian structure whereby geodesic (shortest distance) paths ensue and convexity properties of the entropy along paths reflect on geometric qualities of the graph.  Given this foundation, we can then begin to develop powerful geometric network tools rooted in optimal and stochastic control.  Altogether, as geometry and control of networks is still in its infancy, this program addresses the increasing need to develop such areas as a further tool to understanding complex systems."

That vision creates new challenges for pervasive sensory interfaces to enable the always-on feature, rapid analysis of information, and design for security to prevent cyberattacks. In the meantime, however, significant power will be consumed to run machine learning and complex cryptography algorithms. Critical challenges also exist in integrating classifiers and security measures into sensors to enable continuous monitoring. This project proposes an integrated program of research, education, and outreach to develop low-power sensory systems with theory, algorithms and architectures to enable in-sensor intelligence and security. The transformative aspects of this research project include fundamental understanding of bio-inspired computing, discovering useful intrinsic device characteristics, analysis of real-time data with adaptive machine learning, and exploring chaotic behaviors for efficient encryption. This research will have a significant impact on the needs of society for secure and continuous real-time monitoring to improve health, transportation, and environment through the developments of ubiquitous sensing and computing. This project also incorporates an integrated education plan to inspire and motivate younger generations with diverse backgrounds, in particular women and underrepresented minorities, to pursue education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The plan will introduce the concepts of secure ubiquitous sensing and computing to undergraduate and graduate students, and create strong outreach activities to local K-12 students by illustrating easily-understood concepts of fundamental electronics and mathematics with compelling examples.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop ultra-low-power sensory interfaces that integrate autonomous sensing, classification, and secure measures into a single hardware platform. The bio-inspired classifiers incorporating combinatorial intrinsic characteristics emulate sophisticated biological systems where sensing, learning, and decision making are carried out through nonlinear and adaptive analog computing. The proposed architecture is driven by fast regeneration to extract relative timing information for hierarchical classification. Instead of using linear amplification and fine integration, inherent device mismatch and nonlinearity are exploited in time domain to achieve energy-efficient computation under low supply voltages. To process real-time data in sensors, Bernoulli variational distributions are employed for approximating the posterior to develop a computationally-efficient multi-layer neural network with Bayesian methods. The algorithm integrates medical knowledge and statistical analysis into the training process for adaptation to incoming signals. The proposed algorithm explores maximum sparsity in both sample and feature spaces, where regularizations of hardware constraints are included in the model to ensure robustness. Moreover, to perform encryption in sensors, the information will be randomized into deterministic noise for transmission. The pipeline chaotic system can be trained with time-varying maps to enhance the strength of the security without creating observable patterns to counter side-channel attacks. The transformation function is built with combinatorial intrinsic characteristics, which are physically unclonable to ensure complete security measures. This ensures data integrity and basic authentication for multi-layer security schemes from the edge sensors to the cloud while classification algorithms are performed locally in sensors to achieve rapid analysis and data reduction for wireless communications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this CAREER project is to develop a unified framework, including design of provably robust and efficient algorithms, characterization of the fundamental limits, for signal reconstruction under a variety of practical considerations such as imperfect calibrations, sensor drifts, mutual coupling, corruptions and missing data during data acquisition. The success of this project will have far-reaching impacts on many applications in sensing and imaging science. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will build upon recent advances in signal processing that exploit low-dimensional geometric constraints as a prior to regularize an otherwise ill-posed inference problem. Self-calibration models are introduced where the sensor perturbation is modeled as an unknown that needs to be recovered simultaneously with the signal of interest. The transformative aspect is to recognize that the perturbation also exhibits low-dimensional geometric structures, which shall be exploited in an integrated manner with the low-dimensional geometric structure of the signal of interest to render a well-posed inference problem to enable self-calibration. The CAREER program will advance STEM education by developing tailored educational components for students at all levels, designing signal processing modules that are appropriate for dissemination to K-12 students, and involving women and underrepresented students to promote their success through outreach activities."

For example, in air traffic control the distance and bearing to an aircraft in a dynamic environment is measured by an active radar. This measurement is not exact, having an uncertainty or error in its value. This uncertainty is not described well by the Gaussian pdf because the portion of the bell shaped curve  far from zero, called the tail of the pdf, is far smaller than the radar data suggests: the Gaussian bell shaped curve is known to have a light, rapidly (exponentially) decaying tail, while radar data is said to have a heavy tail.  It has been well recognized that reliance on the Gaussian pdf can be dangerous (reference: The Black Swan by Nessim Taleb).  Many dynamic systems in engineering, economics, biology, financial movements, earthquakes, atmospheric turbulence, etc., are poorly described by Gaussian pdfs and better described by heavy tailed ones. However, majority of current data processing algorithms are based on the Gaussian pdf assumption mainly because it leads to tractable, real-time implementations.  The newly proposed theory is a paradigm shift, which proposes new algorithms based on a heavy tailed pdf, known as the Cauchy pdf. The result is a more accurate and reliable automated system, which even for probabilistic models that are not Cauchy has demonstrated comparable performance to the Gaussian when the probabilistic environment is such. Since extreme data is likely, the estimator is rich in structure and hence is computationally more intense than its Gaussian counterparts.<br/><br/>From a more technical viewpoint, a new class of implementable real-time vector-state estimators and stochastic controllers for linear dynamic systems with additive heavy-tailed Cauchy process and measurement noises are to be developed. The estimation methodology for this vector-state, linear dynamic system with additive Cauchy noises was addressed by developing a recursion for the analytic measurement update and propagation of the character function of the unnormalized conditional probability density function (ucpdf) of the state given the measurement history.  Through a spectral transformation, the character function of the ucpdf is used explicitly in the development of stochastic controllers, based on a model predictive structure. These results entail significant analytical and numerical complexities due to the rich analytic form of the character function of the ucpdf, which produces a sum of terms that grows at each measurement update. The primary goal of the proposed study is to determine implementable real-time vector-state estimators and stochastic controllers by using simplifications that are due to the fundamental structure of the algorithms. Approximations that will conserve the basic structure of the character function are sought, and will be implemented on current computational hardware, such as graphic processing units. This work was performed with a colleague at the Technion under a Bi-national Science Foundation (BSF) Grant. This international collaboration will continue under the NSF/ENG/ECCS-BSF and BSF grants."

Numerous methods for network analysis have been developed using different quantitative approaches. However, many of these methods are still predominantly available for the analysis of static networks, i.e., snapshots of a network at a particular point in time. However, to assess how networks such as those in the brain change over time, improved methods for dynamic network analysis are required. This project will develop mathematical approaches motivated by the driving biological problem of analyzing temporal change of structural and functional brain connectivity, the chronnectome. Structural connectivity includes white matter connections in the brain and hence the underlying cabling enabling information exchange. Functional brain connectivity on the other hand describes how tasks influence brain activity and how different brain areas behave similarly under tasks. Quantifying changes in structural and/or functional connectivity over time can improve understanding of brain diseases, which deviate from normality. Moreover, the approaches developed here will have general use for other dynamic networks, from other biological networks to social networks and beyond. To maximize impact, the computational methods developed here will be made available in open-source form, with a software license permitting free commercial and non-commercial use. The project also includes research training and courses for students in network science.<br/><br/>Networks are commonly described as graphs, with nodes describing entities in a system and edges node relationships. Networks range from unstructured and rapidly changing social networks to structured slowly varying networks capturing structural brain connectivity. Network science seeks to develop methods to mine information from interaction patterns, for example, extracting tightly coupled nodes in communities. Time-dependent network data is increasingly available; however, sufficient analysis methods are still lacking as the majority of approaches have focused on static data, with ongoing development of methods for time-dependent networks having become more common only recently. The goal of this project is to advance general time-dependent network analysis, with brain chronnectome analysis as the guiding driving problem to motivate the technical development. Current approaches for the analysis of time-dependent networks lack several key properties required for chronnectome analysis: e.g., (i) the ability to analyze longitudinal network data, where networks are available for multiple subjects at multiple timepoints, (ii) the ability to include domain-specific prior information (such as prior knowledge of connectivity patterns), and (iii) the ability to deal with inhomogeneous subject groups and discontinuities in time. To address these shortcomings, this project will develop customized network analysis approaches based on (i) extensions to the stochastic block model approach of network analysis, and (ii) regression models for network-valued data."

To enable such a revolution, there is a pressing need for tremendous enhancement of the scarce radio spectrum resources and their use efficiency. The effective access to radio spectrum is crucial for a diverse span of social needs ranging from national security and public safety to transportation, broadcasting and commercial services and plays a decisive role in continuous economic growth. <br/><br/>The wireless access to radio spectrum resources is currently limited by the available signal processing hardware that are only efficient in the lower end of the spectrum; hence, forcing current wireless systems  such as smart phones, tablets and global positioning systems (GPS) to operate in a very limited frequency range (i.e. over ~0.3-6 GHz). Such a small frequency range is already overcrowded and cannot accommodate new wireless users or amenities that require ultra-fast data communication. Furthermore, available hardware are fundamentally incapable of simultaneous data transmission and reception in the same frequency band and at the same time. Therefore, current wireless systems are forced to occupy separate bands for data transmission and reception; hence, cutting the efficiency of the spectrum use in half.<br/> <br/>The proposed research targets surpassing the fundamental limitations of current integrated signal processors through development of a transformative nano-acoustic technology in single crystal germanium (Ge) that 1) operates efficiently over the entire super- and extremely-high-frequency regimes (i.e. 3-300 GHz), and 2) enables simultaneous data transmission and reception in the same frequency band and at the same time, through fundamentally different operation physics; hence, doubling the spectrum use efficiency. Research shall consist of (1) investigation of nano-acoustic waveguides in semiconductors, with a focus on single crystal Ge, for wideband signal processing beyond the ultra-high-frequency regime (>UHF: 0.3-3GHz); (2) exploration of the physics/science of active electronic amplification of elastic signals through the acoustoelectric effects in piezoelectric-semiconductor nano-acoustic waveguides; (3) design and demonstration of low-loss and wideband signal processors beyond the UHF; and (4) engineering of chip-scale nonreciprocal signal processors, with a focus on isolators and circulators. <br/>Integrated with the research, this project targets the enrichment of social knowledge on novel nano-electro-mechanical systems and their indispensable role in everyday life through educational kits and high-school curriculum, and enhancement of diversity in interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (iSTEM) research and careers through involvement of female and minority students."

The fact that the existing small evaporator can only deposit low-melting point metals, such as aluminum and gold, severely limits the research capability at Utah State University.  This proposal is to acquire an advanced sputtering deposition system which will provide crucial improvements include: (1) substrate holder for a 4-in wafer, (2) substrate heater up to 800 C, (3) sufficient power to sputter high-melting point metals, magnetic materials, and dielectric materials, and (4) a load-lock to improve through-put and film quality. <br/><br/>The proposed sputtering deposition system will enable a broad range of funded transformative research at USU including: (1) carbon-nanotube-based radiometer for unprecedented accuracy on measuring radiation for monitoring global warming and calibrate laser power. (2) Depositing catalytic nano-particles on patterned carbon-nanotube sidewalls for CO2 capture to help mitigate climate changes and conversion to useful chemicals such as methanol. (3) Depositing dielectrics and growing graphene patterns for the fabrication of intelligent antennas for next generation of cognitive wireless communication.

More innovative research will be supported since the tool is only limited by the targets available from suppliers around the globe. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this tool should be assessed by the synergy with other tools at NDL as a whole. The proposed sputter coater will be integrated into NDL which has been serving the research needs of faculty from at least 5 departments in Colleges of Engineering and Science. Approximate 30 graduate and undergraduate students from the 6 profiled major research groups are expected to be trained and using this tool with other tools at NDL for their research.  This tool is also planned to be involved in the capstone and senior research projects (~20 students/yr) in 4 engineering classes and a laboratory module for two microfabrication classes (~30 student/yr).  In addition to offering advanced training for university students, NDL participates in many activities organized by various units of USU for disseminating new science and technology to the general public.

However, several concerns related to robustness, safety, risk, and reliability have been raised centered on how to incorporate such large-scale data into solving critical decision-making problems, as the data and the estimated statistical models are often inaccurate. Thus, the proposed research will establish a control-theoretic foundation to resolve this issue by allowing distributional errors in the statistical models and by developing control strategies that are robust against the errors. The potential application domains of the proposed distributionally robust control tools include battery management systems, power grids, food supply chains, manufacturing systems and personalized medicine. With the successful implementations of the proposed control tools in such domains, we will be able to improve individual safety and quality of life, and the reliability of data-driven control systems, which would build high confidence in society. The research outcomes in this project will also be used for (i) the USC Chevron Frontiers in Energy Research Summer Camp which is one of our K-12 STEM outreach efforts; (ii) USC Women in Science and Engineering programs that provide hands-on research experiences to undergraduate and (iii) open house and workshops in Viterbi Center for Engineering Diversity to train and recruit educationally-disadvantaged underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of our proposed research is to develop theoretical foundations and computational methods for distributionally robust control problems associated with safety-critical and/or non-cooperative systems that operate with limited information. The proposed tools can contribute to the following three fundamental areas:  <br/>1. Stochastic control theory: The proposed research aims to establish a game theoretical and algorithmic foundation of distributionally robust control methods for nonlinear stochastic systems when faced with ambiguous distributional information about uncertain variables. In particular, we will investigate a duality-based dynamic programming solution to alleviate the infinite-dimensionality issue in the control problem and combine it with (deep) neural network- and occupation measure based methods to systematically adjust computational complexity and solution accuracy.<br/>2. Safety and risk aware control theory: We will extend stochastic reachability analysis methods to cases with imperfect information about the probability distribution of disturbances. This distributionally robust reachability tool will be used to specify the worst-case probability that the system fails to stay in the safe range and the worst-case risk of system loss. Based on the safety and risk specifications, we will then propose a systematic approach to synthesize a safety preserving and risk-aware control law that is robust against disturbance distributional ambiguity. <br/>3. Incentive contract theory: Incentive contracts under moral hazard can be used to coordinate noncooperative sub-systems controlled by local agents in which local control actions and uncertain variables cannot be monitored by a central coordinator. To broaden the applicability of the contracts to engineering and socio-technical problems, we will generalize the theory in two directions: (i) integrating engineering systems with nontrivial dynamics into contracts, and (ii) constructing incentive contracts in a distributionally robust fashion."

Moreover, new and emerging device concepts promise to open this largely-inaccessible spectrum to further scientific study as well as important engineering applications in imaging, non-destructive test and evaluation, and extremely high data-rate communications. The lower portion of the submillimeter-wave band (100 GHz to 500 GHz) remains a vast and untapped resource for wireless data transfer. Although limitations imposed by atmospheric attenuation make this spectral range unsuitable for long-distance wireless data transfer, these frequencies can potentially be used for super-high-speed wireless data transfer to augment and expand the performance of existing RF and microwave communications. To enable access to this submillimeter-wave band, this project focuses on the development of fabrication processes that will facilitate heterogeneous integration of compound semiconductors (e.g., gallium arsenide or indium phosphide) as well as methods to efficiently connect submillimeter-wave circuits with silicon CMOS integrated circuits. The intellectual merit in developing such processes lies in their potential to improve understanding of the fundamental science of electrical/mechanical interfaces as well as the practical issues involved with applying this knowledge to creating new wireless technologies. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to create the device, interface, and front-end infrastructure needed to extend the capabilities of existing wireless systems to access the submillimeter-wave region of the spectrum. To achieve this goal, the research effort focuses on three primary tasks: (1) robust methods for heterogeneous integration of gallium arsenide (or other III-V semiconductor materials) onto high-resistivity silicon carrier-substrates for interconnection with silicon CMOS backend electronics, (2) design and implementation of low-parasitic interfaces between CMOS chips and III-V submillimeter-wave front-ends, and (3) development of power-efficient up- and down-converters for accessing the submillimeter-wave region. The work proposed here represents an initial and necessary step towards developing an infrastructure that overcomes the limitations of current approaches in utilizing submillimeter-wave technology for wireless applications. Moreover, the research to be undertaken will address fundamental issues in heterogeneous integration, micromachining, and high-performance interfaces.

A cortically-based visual prosthesis is believed to provide a therapeutic solution for all causes of blindness.  However, restoration of visual senses to a useful level has not yet been achieved with cortical implants, mainly due to the complex organization of visual cortex and visual preprocessing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus.  Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to realize a novel neural interface for high-resolution stimulation and recording of neural activity in visual cortex, which will enable better understanding of the structure and function of neural networks during visual processing.  The proposed technology development of this research will yield novel and enabling tools for seamless communication with brain networks of small animals, by which neuroscientists could significantly move fundamental neuroscience knowledge forward.  The developed ultra-low-power microelectronics and advanced microfabrication techniques can be applicable to other implantable devices and biomedical systems.  In addition, the proposed project will offer unique training opportunities for students at multiple levels.  Integrated outreach activities will effectively convert state-of-the-art science and technologies into educational resources accessible to local K-12 schools and communities.  To reach broader audiences, the results will be disseminated through science fairs, publication, workshops and conferences. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>As the core of this proposal, a wireless, trimodal neural interface will be developed to form the most comprehensive interface with the central nervous system of awake, freely behaving animal subjects.  In particular, a multichannel opto-electro array will incorporate epidural light emitting diodes, intracortical microscale waveguide, and microelectrodes in a single platform, capable of optogenetic/electrical stimulation and electrical recording of neural activity of specific cell populations.  Implantable, ultra-low-power microelectronic system-on-a-chip will be able to receive and process neural recording data and drive the optical/electrical neural stimulating array.  Wireless telemetry links will be implemented to transfer power and data efficiently between the external data-acquisition/control units and implanted neural interface.  These key components will be integrated on a mechanically flexible substrate and encapsulated by a hybrid biopolymer package.  The integrated wireless neural interface will be implanted and characterized in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized and freely behaving rats, in order to validate its efficacy for wireless neural recording and stimulation.  The proposed research activities will be conducted by a collaborative team with complementary research expertise in the areas of bioMEMS, microelectronics, and neurophysiology.  Achievement of the goals of this research will pave the road towards the development of a fully functional, cortically-based visual neuroprosthetic system capable of generating artificial vision for completely blind individuals.  While the proposal is specifically tailored for studying the visual function of the brain, the developed technologies can also be used for functional mapping and controlling of other regions of the brain and nervous system, particularly those related to motor functions (e.g. spinal cord and peripheral nervous systems)."

Magnetic materials, in which both the charge and the spin of the electron can be harnessed simultaneously, provide a path to enable a new generation of advanced 'spintronic' devices with capabilities beyond those that can be achieved using the electron charge alone.  The ability to electrically gate charge transport was key to the electronics revolution, but at present, no mechanism exists to effectively gate magnetism in materials.  This project seeks fundamental understanding and practical application of a new mechanism to control magnetism electrically that can enable an unprecedented level of control with fast response, low gate voltage and power input, and robustness over many cycles.  The transformative aspect is the use of protons instead of electrons to mediate changes in magnetic properties in solid materials by injecting them towards and away from a magnetic thin film using a small applied voltage.  This new control mechanism could deliver superior functionality to enable future memory, logic, and other spin-based technologies that would have tremendous fundamental, technological, and societal impact.  The project provides a fertile training ground for undergraduate and graduate students in key interdisciplinary nanotechnologies, and will include an international collaboration that provides international scientific exposure for the supported graduate student.  Educational innovation will be achieved through project-centric curriculum development at the undergraduate level.  Outreach and diversity activities will include hosting high school teachers through the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Teachers program and by developing and delivering a 'Magnetism in Action' program at a local elementary school classroom for hands-on explorations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>Technical:  The objective of the proposed program is to enable a new means to electrically gate magnetism and spin transport in spintronic devices by exploiting reversible hydrogen insertion in all-solid-state thin-film heterostructures.  In ultrathin ferromagnetic films adjacent to a heavy metal like Pt and Pd, broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling give rise to a wealth of phenomena such as perpendicular anisotropy, chiral and other exchange interactions, and spin-orbit torques.  These same metals are well-known hydrogen storage materials that undergo a reversible transition between metallic and metal-hydride phases with correspondingly substantial changes to structural and electronic properties.  The transformative aspect of the proposed research is to harness electrochemical water splitting in the ambient atmosphere catalyzed by a rare-earth oxide/noble metal interface, to act as a solid-state proton pump capable of driving H+ ions through the gate oxide and into/out of the heavy-metal adjacent to a ferromagnet.  Heterostructures will be designed to examine and optimize low-voltage gating of critical magnetic properties, to assess the reaction and diffusion kinetics, to identify and mitigate device failure modes, and to apply this knowledge to exemplary devices in which spin waves can be electrically gated in dynamic magnonic waveguides and crystals.  The proposed research will establish a revolutionary new approach that will enable new devices and spin-based architectures, while providing a powerful knob to explore the origins of some of the most important interactions being studied in nanomagnetism today. The project moreover provides new interdisciplinary insights by combining spintronics with solid-state ionics, two traditionally distinct disciplines, which will lead to synergistic approaches to tackle key fundamental and technological challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such graphs frequently have complex structures and may be time-varying. Combined with recent rapid advances in data-collection technology, such as in cyber networks, data search engines, geo-positioning and wireless sensor networks, geographic information systems, and bioinformatics, this has resulted in the need for the development of a comprehensive and systematic framework that allows for the simple analysis and use of such large graph models.  As graph-based models for these systems are typically complex and high dimensional, the resulting analysis of their fundamental system behavior is often intractable.  We propose an algorithmic framework that addresses a common requirement in the study of these systems - to find simplified graph models that are representative of the original graphs.  In parallel with the technical research efforts, educational programs will be developed having a unique interdisciplinary nature with a computational core as the unifying thread. Undergraduates will be involved in simulations that will introduce them to the underlying research fields in a natural and intuitive manner. Targeted activities focused on the emerging prevalence of computational data analysis and optimization in physical and health sciences will be included, with one goal being to attract students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This research program addresses the need for reducing the complexity of graph models by uniting concepts from information and optimization theories, network analysis, control and dynamic system theory, and graph theory.  The development and application of a general computational framework addressing network and graph-centric aggregation problems will be undertaken.  This framework will incorporate domain-specific constraints on network structure; variability in interactions, interdependencies and cost functions; and allow for dynamics in constituent elements and network topologies. The resulting algorithms will be scalable and capable of handling exceptionally large data sets. Conceptually, the proposed framework is based on a stochastic approach where a probability density function is ascribed on the space of decision variables such that the most probable value for the decision variable is an approximate solution to the combinatorial problem under the given constraints. This probability density function is derived using the maximum entropy principle, which is motivated by the law of minimum free energy in physical chemistry; a similar mechanism is employed by nature in solving analogous combinatorial problems. In this project, we will develop a maximum entropy framework that will transcend standard approaches to large-scale graph-reduction problems derived from varied application domains, while exploiting their commonalities. The immediate application domains include neuroscience and epidemic control, with expected long-range potential impacts in biological, chemical and health sciences. The work in this proposal will be apt for the analysis and simplification of human contact networks that lead toward advanced epidemic analysis and control, and projects that incorporate networks of generative models, such as classification of brain-activity data from brain machine interfaces to predict motor intent for the purpose of guiding prosthetic devices.  The proposed framework facilitates the inclusion of information and constraints that are unique to these applications and not adequately covered in existing methods."

This may have significant impact on large-scale scientific computing and applications involving huge amounts of data processing. The antenna modules mimic ""wireless-base-station-on-chip"" concept since the antennas route signals inside the computer to achieve much faster and more efficient processing output. The project will demonstrate for the very first time a small compact and reconfigurable antenna module to be designed at high frequencies so they can be placed in computers. The specific frequency is chosen so that the antennas do not radiate beyond the computer itself. The research methods include designing the antenna by using simulations, and by demonstrating and testing antennas in the environment to verify that the desired goals are met. The impact of this research is to improve the capability of solving increasingly demanding computing problems in emerging scientific applications. This technology can potentially break performance barriers observed in computing and create new computing architectures. The project will integrate research with education, and provide learning opportunities merging the areas of computing, interconnects, high frequency simulations, and measurements to senior-level undergraduate students and graduate students. High school students and college freshmen will be able to explore technologies in a new freshman course module that introduces university students to different opportunities in electrical engineering. Graduate student course offerings will be enhanced with a signal integrity course for the online Masters of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering program at the University of Arizona. Hands-on and engagement activities will be offered to train and prepare students for their future career in industry or academia.<br/><br/>This project will create and demonstrate one of the first chip-compatible antenna arrays that allow real-time pattern adaptation for use in massively multicore computing. The antennas will be designed on a separate antenna module that includes a pattern-reconfigurable antenna to allow for redirection of the antenna patterns in the horizontal direction (chip to chip). The array will achieve at least eight unique beam positions to allow communication to neighboring cores. The antenna module has several novel components: it is thin (1-2 mm), includes a 3D (multilayer) stacked beamformer, and can be connected to a transceiver using flip-chip (solder ball bump) attachment technologies. On system level, the project will demonstrate a novel system design using reconfigurable wireless links to simplify the I/O (Input/Output) architecture and improve system reliability with reconfigurable data paths that work around broken links. The project includes developing accurate link models that takes into account antenna and propagation characteristics. This will provide for accurate network planning using details of the physical antennas such as their pattern characteristics in the operating environment, and enable optimization of the computer network topology.

Skyrmions are a novel magnetic ordering configuration in which electron's spins are arranged in whirlpool-like structures. They hold promise for next-generation magnetic information storage because of their nanoscale dimensions that can enable high information storage density and ability for ultralow energy consumption. Nanowires are ideal hosts for skyrmions since they not only serve as a natural platform for magnetic devices but can also potentially stabilize skyrmions. In preliminary results, the PI's group has shown enhanced stability, electrical detection, and current-driven dynamics of skyrmions in silicides and germanides  nanowires,  and proposes to fabricate novel device to create, manipulate, and detect isolated magnetic skyrmions in nanowires. The success of these studies will demonstrate the feasibility for skyrmion-based magnetic memory devices and open up new design concepts for developing novel spintronic devices with low-power consumption and enhanced performance, and therefore bring broad technological impacts.

Skyrmions are a novel type of exotic magnetic ordering in which electron's spins are arranged in whirlpool-like structures. Due to the topologically non-trivial spin vortex arrangement, skyrmions can be thought as free particle-like isolated magnetic domains (i.e. skyrmions outside of the skyrmion lattice) that are stable against small perturbations in magnetic field and temperature and do not pin strongly to the crystal lattice or impurities. A much lower critical current density is needed to drive the motion of skyrmions, therefore, they hold promise for next-generation magnetic storage, such as magnetic racetrack memory devices, because their nanoscale dimensions can enable high information storage density and their low threshold for current-driven motion can enable ultralow energy consumption. Skyrmions are superior over ferromagnetic domains for magnetic racetrack memory devices due to their stability and ease of manipulation with electrical current. Nanowires are ideal hosts for skyrmions since they not only serve as a natural platform for magnetic racetrack memory devices but can also potentially stabilize skyrmions. Based on the preliminary results on single-crystal nanowires of MnSi and other B20 silicides PI proposes novel device experiments to create, manipulate, and detect isolated magnetic skyrmions in nanowires by using Lorentz transmission microscopy, cantilever magnetometry, and Hall effect measurements to map the skyrmion phase diagrams in nanowires; using new magnetoresistance measurements to electrically detect confined skyrmions; nucleating isolated skyrmions using completely electrical means; and ultimately a potential demonstration of prototype skyrmion racetrack memory devices. This innovative and interdisciplinary project integrates the already developed nanowire materials with careful device studies to enable the first experimental demonstration of nucleation of skyrmions in nanowires and possible proof-of-concept magnetic racetrack memory devices based on skyrmions."

Current regulation regarding usage of the electromagnetic spectrum follows a static licensed allocation model. However, it is widely recognized that this model is no longer able to meet the rapidly growing demands for spectrum access. Dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radios have been proposed as solutions to the problem, but their ultimate success is predicated upon the existence of high-quality spectrum occupancy data. This project proposes a bold new concept for dynamic spectrum data analysis, which will significantly improve the efficiency of radio spectrum utilization while at the same time providing improved energy efficiency. Specifically, this concept is based on a fundamentally new way of processing millimeter-wave and microwave information using spin waves in magnetic thin films. Such new technology will make possible the replacement of today's bulky passive electromagnetic systems by a chip-scale, low-power device. If successful, the devices proposed in this project will become a new class of millimeter-wave and microwave components, performing many functions that today are only achievable with transistor-based circuits.  Students will be educated and trained in this new technology. Graduate students will be exposed to avenues for commercialization through University of Notre Dame's Innovation Park and the Engineering Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Excellence Masters (ESTEEM) Program that partners science, engineering, and business students with research faculty toward the goal of commercializing locally-generated fundamental research. Local high-school teachers will participate through an NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program, which will also include faculty from the local Ivy Tech Community College.<br/><br/>This proposal presents a micromagnetics-based real-time spectrum sensor that is low-cost, high-performance, and chip-scale. The combination of these features means this sensor can be deployed on individual devices in a network or IoT devices to provide the high spatial resolution necessary to realize spatial dynamic spectrum access and to provide the speed and resolution necessary to realize temporal dynamic spectrum access. In the proposed scheme, millimeter-wave and microwave signals are converted to spin-waves and processed by spin-wave interference, and then the intensity distribution of the interference patterns is converted back to the electrical domain. In particular, a spin-wave-based frequency spectrum and signal analyzer device is proposed that can perform high-resolution, real-time, wideband spectral analysis on millimeter-wave and microwave signals and provide an on-chip, low-power compact replacement for bulky and expensive spectrum analyzer instruments, which contain a large assembly of discrete microwave components (filters, sweep-oscillators, etc.). The benefits of this scheme, which combine small size, low power, and high speed, derive from the low-power and short-wavelength characteristics of spin waves. As such, our approach provides a potential solution to a particularly challenging task in modern electronics, namely to realize devices that are both fast and low-power. In conventional CMOS-based electronics, power consumption increases quickly with increasing computing speed (clock rate), which makes it very challenging (maybe impossible) to simultaneously achieve low power and high speed (several tens of gigahertz) operation in electrical devices. Our proposed spin-wave-based devices may provide a solution to this fundamental problem."

As a result of the pervasive  interest in scientific analysis at a system level along with  the ever-growing capabilities for high-throughput data collection in various fields, the study of networks has increased dramatically with multidisciplinary research efforts from researchers ranging from physics to systems engineering and the bio-behavioral sciences. As modern interconnected systems grow in size and importance, while they become more complex and heterogeneous, there is an urgent need to advance a holistic theory of networks.  In this context, research in this project will contribute towards understanding the inherent complexities of large-scale and strongly coupled systems ranging from critical engineering infrastructures to the brain. It will also impact teaching and design of networks, as well as signal processing theory and practice at the  fundamental level. At a broader scale, through cross-domain extrapolation of this project's Network Science leitmotif, the insights and technologies developed here will provide valuable tools for fundamental science and engineering research, positively impact environment and economy, and permeate benefits to cyber-security, IoT technologies, neuroscience, healthcare and sensing-integration for cyber-physical systems.<br/><br/>This research effort places particular emphasis on modeling, identification, and controllability of distributed network processes - often conceptualized as signals defined on the vertices of a graph. To untangle the latent structure of such signals, the key novel insight is to view them as outputs of unobserved graph filters  that model the emergence of complex network dynamics. Albeit simple, graph filters are appealing since they represent linear transformations between graph signals that can be implemented via local interactions among nodes, and they are well-suited to model network diffusion processes while remaining analytically tractable. In this direction, the research agenda is to develop novel theory and algorithms for the challenging problem of localizing sources of network diffusion given an observed (output) graph signal, e.g., a spatial temperature profile measured by a wireless sensor network, an opinion profile in a social network, or the neural activity in different regions of the brain. At a fundamental level, this effort broadens the scope of classical blind system identification to networks, or, of blind deconvolution of temporal and spatial signals to unstructured graph domains. Advocating a graph signal processing approach the aim tis o boost the interest in the area beyond its theoretical aesthetics as an elegant generalization of classical signal processing, and highlight its practical implications when solving real-world engineering problems encountered with sensor, social and brain networks, to name a few.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

QIP is expected to be used to secure and scale-up multiparty quantum computations to tackle computational problems that currently remain outside the reach of computers, such as large-scale molecular simulations for materials design and drug discovery; or it can connect a network of distributed quantum sensors for ultraprecise measurements with applications to biological imaging, gravitometry, and position navigation-timing. In a general landscape of QIP, quantum communications plays a special role, because it can be used to implement a secure data transmission network, leveraging the concept of quantum cryptography, where the security of transmission is guaranteed by the basic laws of quantum physics. Over the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in science and technology related to the generation, manipulation, storage, propagation, and detection of photons for QIP. Much of this progress has been focused on developing individual device components that satisfy the rather stringent requirements of QIP at the single-photon level. Integrating these individual components into a complete quantum-communication system with optimized operation requires an interdisciplinary approach. The move beyond individual discrete components necessitates a new paradigm that will integrate various components on a single chip. The main vision of this research is to push the frontiers of engineering in quantum technologies by implementing a silicon-based integrated platform and exploring the interactions of quantum devices in a quantum network. In addition to the advancement of the new science and technology, a major outcome will be the exposure of undergraduate and graduate students working on this project to a broad range of topics in an interdisciplinary environment.

The research covers both design and fabrication of single-photon and entangled photon pair sources, single-photon detectors, and integrated channels to manipulate photons, as well as experiments to characterize the quantum nature of the photonic states for implementation in viable quantum communication protocols. The proposed integrated platform is very promising for implementation in a quantum communication system network, as well as in development and realization of large-scale systems.

This vision is becoming possible due to recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Current computing technologies are still far from creating a digital entity that is as capable and as energy efficient as a biological brain. Digital learning systems are notoriously power hungry and can require a room-full of digital computer clusters. Compare that to the human brain which performs all its feats at a meager power budget of twenty watts and a weight of less than two kilograms. One reason for this inefficiency is that transistors, the basic building blocks of digital computers, do not function in the same way as synapses, the basis of biological computing. The proposed research aims at overcoming this barrier by making a relatively basic change to the structure of the transistor. An emerging material with ferroelectric properties, doped hafnium oxide, will be introduced into transistors. The new device is called a ferroelectric field effect transistor and can emulate the properties of biological synapses. In this project, the unique properties of the synaptic ferroelectric transistor will be used to design and optimize artificial intelligence cores such as deep neural networks that vastly exceed the performance and efficiency of the current state-of-the-art. The project will train participating students in an interdisciplinary setting that involves material science, circuit design, computer architecture, and neuro-science. The STEM outreach and education programs will help participating undergraduates, high school students and high school teachers to broaden their experience in computer science and novel semiconductor devices.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The project will explore the rich domain dynamics in ferroelectric hafnia-zirconia alloy gated silicon transistors to build synaptic units for vector matrix multiplication crossbars. The architecture and system level work will entail the design and optimization of full-blown deep neural networks based on these ferroelectric crossbar kernels. Physics based compact models of ferroelectric transistors that account for the important details of domain dynamics will be developed which will tie the material-device level work and the architecture-system level work. A key feature of the project is its vertically integrated approach that involves different levels in the computing hierarchy from materials to systems. Innovations at all these different levels will ensure that the interesting properties of the emerging ferroelectric device technology can be fully leveraged to create an energy efficient and high-performance hardware platform for advanced machine learning and data intensive cognitive applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among many others, extracellular vesicles, viruses, and prion proteins are natural nanoparticles and play essential roles in biology, disease, and medicine.  For instance, extracellular vesicles are key in cell communication, growth and development, and can effectively mediate drug delivery.  Viruses cause severe diseases like influenza epidemic and HIV/AIDS.  Prion proteins are linked to Alzheimer's.  On the other hand, numerous artificial nanoparticles have been synthesized for many important applications including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cancer hyperthermia therapy, drug and gene delivery, flexible electronics manufacturing, solar cell development, and surface plasmon resonance sensing.  Additionally, more than 1000 commercial products are developed with nanoparticles.  Thus, there is a widespread and urgent need for convenient and accurate measurement of particle size, size distribution, density (particles/mL), and surface charge.  These parameters are essential for any further nanoparticle exploration, such as colloidal stability, biological behavior, and toxicity.  Nevertheless, measuring these basic parameters is very difficult due to small particle size (less than 100 nm in diameter), significant size variation, and diverse particle origin.  They require single-particle, multi-parameter, high sensitivity and high throughput measurement, which is not available from existing techniques such as tunable resistive pulse sensing, advanced flow cytometry, nanoparticle tracking, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy.  This project proposes a novel broadband microwave flow cytometry method to address the problem.  The proposed method is expected to significantly facilitate nanoparticle efforts, such as those mentioned above, and strongly impact the development and advancement of nanomaterials, biology, medicine, mesoscopic physics, chemistry, and nanoparticle products.  The project also provides support and training to graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars in the emerging area of nanoparticle instrumentation science and technology.  It enables a female faculty member from a predominantly undergraduate institution to participate in cutting-edge nanoscale science research.  Additionally, it offers an exciting topic to attract high school, undergraduate, and underrepresented students to experience and study advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate broadband microwave flow cytometry techniques for the detection and comprehensive measurement of nanoparticles in a label-free and non-invasive manner.  Automated tunable interferometers together with nano-sensing structures and nanofluidic channels will be developed to measure single nanoparticles at multiple microwave frequencies.  The targeted particle size is from 20 nm to 200 nm in diameter.  The minimum detectable particle volume is about 10 times smaller than that of tunable resistive pulse sensing, an existing technique considered as one of the most promising nanoparticle characterization methods.  Physical and electrical models of a few nanoparticles will be established for data interpretation and parameter extraction.  Algorithms will be developed to obtain the size, size distribution, density (particles/mL), surface charge (i.e. zeta potential) and frequency dependent dielectric properties of nanoparticles.  Such dielectric properties are currently not available with any other technique.  The targeted throughput is 1 particle/second for a comprehensive multi-parameter measurement and 10 particles/second for simple detection.  The throughputs can be further improved in future development.  Commonly used nanoparticles (polystyrene and magnetic iron oxide) and copolymer micelles will be used to test the proposed techniques, and the performance will be evaluated by comparing with light scattering measurement results."

Indeed, historically, such dependences often formed the basis of physical laws. The abundance of large data-sets about complex natural or engineered systems in our modern technological world, has brought a sense of urgency to the need for reliable and versatile machine learning tools to detect relations between processes. The starting point of the project is the realization that often the observational time scale at which data is collected may not be the native time scale at which interactions occur and thus sampling might obfuscate the nature of such relations.  Indeed, linear dynamical relations between continuous-time processes may not be readily detectable from data collected at any finite sampling rate.  This project will develop methodologies that will allow to fully recover sought relations between processes at the natural time-scale from data at a (typically coarser) observational time-scale. Theory and statistical learning tools that will be developed for that purpose will be applied to geophysical processes, such as identifying relationships between climate variables using a suite of observations from ground and multi-satellite sensors at different spatio-temporal scales. <br/><br/>When relations between variables are dynamic (i.e., the interaction relies on memory in the system), sampling hides the nature of dynamical dependencies. Specifically, in linear stochastic processes, dynamical dependencies between vector-valued processes are reflected in the nullity of the power spectral density matrix when this is estimated at the natural time-scale of the process. At the observational sampling rate, the corresponding nullity no longer relates to the structure of the dynamical relations. Yet, with proper analysis the dynamical relations can be recovered by projecting sample-models to the natural time-scale of the processes involved.  In fact, for linear stochastic processes there is a fastest process time-scale that is consistent with the coarser scale observational data, and it is at that fine scale that models can be projected via solving suitable algebraic equations.  At any coarser scale, dynamical dependencies cannot be readily detected. The project will focus on how to learn and recover the natural time-space scale at which dynamical dependencies must be sought. Statistical learning tools will be developed and applied to geophysical data as proof of concept.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems typically operate well when the scene dynamics do not change rapidly. Unfortunately this is not the case in emerging societally-important applications like swarms of drones in rescue missions, smart self-driving cars on roadways, or cyber-physical systems searching for suicide bombers when they are on the move. This project will benefit our society with the development of the first four-dimensional (4D) millimeter-wave imaging system operating in fast changing scenarios, in which safety-critical decisions must be made quickly. One of the new applications of this system will be finding security threats, concealed under clothing or inside backpacks, in open areas like shopping malls, sport venues, and office buildings. Specifically, the system will have the capability to scan multiple people moving within a volumetric region of 26 cubic meters, producing 1000 image frames per second in three dimensions, thus outperforming existing millimeter-wave sensing and imaging systems that are currently used at airport checkpoints. In addition to the societal impact, the Principal Investigator (PI) will build a strong educational program through which diverse audiences can understand the principles and limitations of wave-based imaging systems. The integration of research and education will be accomplished through the development of new curricula and research training methods for students, as well as through the elaboration of a roadmap for transitioning students into industry, in collaboration with Northeastern University (NEU) Cooperative Education Program. The outreach plan includes enabling research experiences for K-12, undergraduate, and underrepresented students in collaboration with the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) centers at NEU, as well as education through online materials and public venues.<br/><br/>The research goal of this CAREER program is to understand the theoretical principles and fundamental limitations of adaptable compressive sensing and imaging systems using 4D (temporal and spatial) coding and to develop and experimentally validate these principles through a novel 4D millimeter-wave adaptive compressive imaging radar system. This system will produce 4D volumetric frame rates beyond 1000 frames per second, each frame having over one million pixels. The primary challenges of implementing 4D adaptable imaging systems are the following: 1) the system must be capable of handling variable dynamics, i.e., objects moving with different velocities and located at different focal ranges; 2) the system must sample data with sufficient signal to noise ratio during the limited period of time; and 3) the system must sample data extremely fast to perform fast 4D video reconstruction with high volumetric frame rates. This project will address these challenges as follows: (i) it will develop a new theory that brings together functional analysis, information theory, compressive sensing, and adaptable metamaterials to enhance the information transfer efficiency of sensing systems; (ii) it will develop a new mathematical framework to optimize 4D codes based on the desired information rate and energy efficiency of the compressive imaging system; and (iii) the system will utilize spatial light modulators, vortex-meta-lenses, and compressive reflectors to perform the coding and to dynamically adapt to the state of the imaging region. The result of this research will establish the scientific basis for the proposed new sensing and imaging systems, by enhancing the imaging performance, reliability, and efficiency while reducing the hardware complexity, overall cost, and energy consumption of the system."

The proposed automatic water monitoring solution is based on portable radio frequency sensors that can be quickly deployed and integrated into a wireless sensor framework. Compared with traditional water gauging technologies that are typically based on acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, or older float and shaft angle decoders, the proposed solution does not require contact with water and thus offers larger measurement range and robustness against biological buildup and corrosion. Compared with existing microwave technologies being investigated for water monitoring, the proposed solution features much lower cost and smaller hardware size taking advantage of advanced semiconductor technology, high-linearity demodulation, adaptive DC-tuning architecture, and embedded signal processing. Furthermore, the proposed system can operate with battery power and thus does not require continuous connection to powerlines, which could be vulnerable in the event of hurricanes. Field tests of monitoring receding water after hurricane flood and comparison with results from conventional measurements will validate the proposed approach. <br/><br/>If proven to be successful based on measurement in realistic environment, the proposed technology can be widely deployed as a sensor network in many urban, suburban, and rural communities to help government and homeowners automatically and accurately obtain real-time flood level information across a large region, without sending volunteers to dangerous areas for manual check. In addition to benefiting the national infrastructure, it will be valuable to many households for local flood monitoring and home protection. Furthermore, the big data collected from a network of such sensors will serve as a valuable resource for the understanding of the history, pathways, and extent of floodwater. It may enable strong interdisciplinary collaborative effort between researchers from electrical and coastal engineering and may result in transdisciplinary tools in sensor technology and coastal science."

In addition, certain classes of computational problems, i.e. combinatorial optimization problems, which have extensive applications in many real-world situations such as fault diagnosis, scheduling, resource allocation and even neural network training are fundamentally difficult to solve using the Boolean framework, the backbone of our current computational framework. This proposal aims to explore the potential of coupled oscillator networks made of living heart muscle cells, or bio-oscillators, as a collective computing fabric for solving computationally hard problems such as optimization, learning and inferences. New computing paradigms that can solve computationally hard problems efficiently using cell-based collective computing fabrics will transform how synthetic biocomputing circuits are built. In addition, the proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the electrical communication in muscle cell networks impacting potential future applications ranging from biorobotics to understanding and treating muscle disorders. The broader impacts will further be achieved through interdisciplinary student mentoring and education by the PIs with complementary backgrounds in Biology, Engineering and Computer Science, timely dissemination of key research outcomes via published papers and presentations, as well as proposed outreach activities including a workshop for middle school girls providing hands-on activities in STEM, mentoring of high school students, and a weekend long workshop each year for undergraduate and graduate students, called 'Biology Inspired Computing'. These activities will contribute towards educating a new cadre of students that will meet the future need of this emerging field. Attention will be paid to student recruitment from under-represented groups by participating in such recruitment programs at the PIs' institution.<br/><br/>Current designs that explore biological components for biocomputing leverages the information processing units of the cells, such as DNA, gene or protein circuitries, which are inherently slow (hours to days speed). Using electrically active cells that could individually operate in the hundred Hertz regime, and can be connected as networks to perform massively parallel tasks, can transform biocomputing and lead to novel ways of energy efficient information processing. The goal of this project is to explore the potential of electrically coupled oscillator networks made of living heart muscle cells to form a collective computing fabric for solving computationally hard problems such as optimization, learning and inference tasks. Heart muscle cells are electrically active components that can initiate and relay electrical signals without loss. More interestingly, they spontaneously beat (i.e. oscillate) at a stable pace, and when coupled with each other through ion fluxes, they synchronize to a locked, steady frequency. In this study, it is hypothesized that reconfigurable circuits fabricated using coupled heart muscle cell oscillators, or bio-oscillators, can be configured into functional continuous-time dynamical systems to solve computationally hard problems. Towards this end, state-of-art nanobiofabrication methods will be used to create bio-oscillators and to bi-directionally couple them through nanoporous ionic membranes for programmable computing. The design space will be explored for the geometry and size of the individual bio-oscillators, nanoporous membrane design for bio-oscillator connectivity through ion fluxes, as well as the network topology and fabrication feasibility of large bio-oscillator arrays. First, a pair of coupled bio-oscillators will be studied and computationally efficient compact models will be developed that accurately reflect the continuous time dynamics of the coupled bio-oscillators. Then, the design will be scaled up to larger network of coupled bio-oscillators and a feasibility study would be conducted for solving a prototypical hard optimization task such as vertex coloring of graph and graph partitioning. In addition to their inherent connectivity, scalability and parallel processing ability, the muscle cell-based approach proposed in this study requires minimal energy mostly in the form of sugar, and as such will be a low-energy alternative to current energy demanding traditional computing approaches for solving hard optimization problems using heuristics based digital computing techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to charge, electrons have spin that can be manipulated with magnetic and electric fields, resulting in a spin-polarized current that carries more information than is possible with charge alone. Spin-transport electronics demonstrate advantages for design of novel devices to overcome the limitation of traditional electronics. Graphene, a single atomic layer of graphitic carbon, has unique physical properties that make it very attractive for spintronic applications. Various experimental demonstrations of spin transport in graphene have been achieved by interfacing graphene with other classes of materials, including ferromagnetic materials, semiconductors, and metal electrodes. However, the experimental results are still well below theoretically predicted values. To bridge this gap, two areas of research is proposed: fabrication of graphene and a design of a novel device to advance graphene-based spintronic devices that will be capable of higher data transfer speeds, increased processing power and memory density, and added storage capacity. The PSU and Intel partnership will significantly enhance the transfer of research results to industry. It will also broaden the training and experiences of graduate and undergraduate students involved and facilitate active interactions between PSU and Intel scientists and train them in emerging areas of materials science and device technology, where fundamental insights can result in profound and rapid practical advances. The participation of underrepresented undergraduates in this project will be leveraged through ongoing NSF funded REU and LSAMP programs, the McNair Scholarship program, and the Undergraduate Research and Mentoring Program at PSU.<br/><br/>This proposal aims at the design and fabrication of novel hybrid diffusion drift spin valve (HDDSV) arrays through processes that are adaptable to industry. The proposed device will allow systematic investigations of graphene spin transport parameters including spin lifetime, spin diffusion length, and polarization injection efficiency by variations of device components and dimensions. The non-local spin valves (NLSV) device employed to study graphene spin transport has resulted in experimental values that are orders of magnitude lower than those theoretically predicted. The proposed HDDSVs are uniquely designed to detect nonlocal signals originating from a spin accumulation of spin polarized charge carriers, which occurs away from the influence of ferromagnetic (FM)/tunnel barrier (TB)/Graphene interfaces. This research effort represents a multi-disciplinary approach of combining graphene synthesis, device fabrication, and data measurement and analysis, to advance the understanding of graphene spin transport properties. The overall goal of this research is to address the principle roadblocks to the advancement of graphene spintronics. The novel device configuration will have the capability of isolating the effects of ferromagnetic contacts from graphene spin transport measurements, while enabling spin and charge carrier manipulation simultaneously. The proposed device will allow new spin transfer phenomena to be examined. The study of such a novel device will reveal the fundamental effects of ferromagnetic contacts and charge carrier drift in relation to spin diffusion lengths and spin lifetimes in a graphene transport channel. The academic and industrial research teams' complementary expertise and comprehensive capabilities warrant success of the proposed goals."

Thousands of new cases of spinal cord injury result in almost quarter million individuals in various degrees of paraplegia, due to automobile accidents, violent incidents, and other physical traumas. The affected individuals are treated by surgery and often require prosthetics which are in many ways primitive owing to a lack of information bandwidth between the brain and the prosthetic actuators and associated control electronics. This project could lead to reliable brain machine interfaces to neurons and peripheral axons to covey greater bandwidth of information over the lifetime of patients. Many patients suffering from Parkinson's disease can utilize life-long neural interfaces to feedback control electrical activities both through reliable sensing and actuation. Ultrasonic methods to reliably express stem cells into healthy neurons may lead to a targeted approach to repairing damaged parts of the brain by focused expression of stem cells inside brain and peripheral tissues. Reliable life-long interfaces will also lead to new ways for society to be productive. Being able to collect brain signals and using the data to ascertain processing required in daily life may provide new ways for humans to accomplish more tasks providing a productivity boost needed for society to progress into the future. This project will also train an electrical engineering student in biology and neural engineering producing a multidisciplinary skill-set. The work will also result in a new course on Science and Technology of GHz to THz Ultrasonic, generating an online course material aimed from K-12 to graduate program in Applied Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering.<br/><br/>Impact of electronic interfaces to neuroscience and neuro therapy is limited by two major challenges. One challenge is the failure of electrical neural interfaces over long term, and the other is the lack of technology for non-invasive, localized excitation of axons and neurons with 1-5m resolution for nerve activation and healing using stem cell therapies. Electrical interfaces consisting of electrodes that sample neuron generated potentials and currents are regularly used in research, some even with RF-powered and RF-data linked implantable systems have been developed. However, the neural probes do not last beyond a few weeks to a few months, as tissue buildup on the electrodes insulates the signal flow, even with capacitive readout. This broad exploratory project will lead to the identification of new effects of high frequency ultrasonics from GHz to THz, applied to neural cells and tissues. This capability is largely unexplored owing to the difficulty of conducting high frequency ultrasonic in the laboratory, and have the results translated to actual use in animal models and eventually into humans. By using a technology that enables miniaturization into CMOS chips, new ultrasonic effects may be discovered that can be translated into practice for life-long viable neural interfaces. These effects include new modes of ultrasonic absorption in ultrahigh frequency ranges, and in neural environments with time varying chemical and physical changes. Using the very small wavelengths in the 10s of microns to nanometer range, ultrasonic waves can be focused to individual neural components such as a single axon of a nerve bundle, without invasive probes."

Computers and their applications, however, have been the backbone of modern life and will continue to be so at even a higher rate.  The demands for increased computing capabilities will continue to be on the rise due to the increase in data volumes that need to be processed.   Further, the increase in demand for higher accuracy will also continue in order to support the rising needs for scientific discoveries and engineering breakthroughs, and the demand for smaller and more energy efficient computing devices is also rapidly growing as we move towards smarter cities and a smarter world.  It is therefore imperative to search for game changing computing devices that are orders of magnitude faster, smaller and more energy efficient as opposed to the current digital computer technology that seem to be approaching daunting physical limitations.  This proposal introduces a transformative computing device based on analog computing, reconfigurable computing architectures, nanophotonics, and the advances in material science.   This new computing device, which is referred to as the reconfigurable optical computer (ROC), aims to achieve a leap forward in processing technology in addition to opening the doors for continued future developments.<br/>This reconfigurable optical processor (ROC) that is capable of performing computations out of first principle by solving those partial differential equations (PDEs) that are used for most simulations in science and engineering in one shot, rather than iteratively as in digital computers.  Such PDEs can be realized and directly solved using a network of electric components. Those electric circuit components will be implemented using programmable nanophotonic devices, referred to as the reconfigurable optical elements (ROEs).  ROEs  can change their optical characteristics under electrical bias to represent different components suitable for solving different problems.  ROEs are novel voltage programmable photonic components utilizing electro-optic effects (i.e. modulation) and optical absorption (i.e. photodetection) to mimic electrical circuit elements. The approach includes a risk-tired strategy for ROE design (low-to-high). Supporting programming/reconfiguration memory cells and enabling electronic devices will be explored to form an integrated reconfigurable architecture, the Reconfigurable Optical Computer (ROC).  An appropriate software stack including programming and execution modules for such new paradigm will be also investigated to provide a productive platform for domain users.  If successful, the ROC system can potentially achieve orders of magnitude improvements in speed, energy consumption and footprint as compared to the modern state-of-the-art processors and potentially simplify software, providing substantial impacts on many domains from the electronic industry to smart life."

This is enabled by RF-excitation magnetic fields generated by so-called RF coils, whose frequency is proportional to the strength of the scanner's magnet, in units of tesla (T). Whereas state-of-the-art clinical MRI scanners are 3-T systems, MRI machines operating at 1.5 T still prevail in hospitals by a very large margin. MRI systems with stronger magnets and higher RF frequencies can provide higher resolution of images, faster exams, and more comfort for patients, among other improvements. However, they require new engineering and design approaches to make them operational, safe, and efficient. The main area of engineering research in advancing MRI scanners is in improving RF coils and fields. This exactly is the area of focus of this research project, aimed at introducing, developing, testing, evaluating, and establishing novel RF exciters and advancing RF coil designs for magnet strengths of 3 T, 4.7 T, 7 T, etc., for both state-of-the-art and next-generation clinical MRI scanners. The proposed research provides a new scientific methodology and engineering technology to solve a very general and challenging problem at the interface between RF and MRI and junction between engineering and science and with immediate applications, and hence it has substantial broader impacts on science and technology. Broader impacts on society are especially warranted by great and growing needs for medical diagnostic tools based on high-resolution imaging of human bodies, organs, and tissues. Education and outreach plan of this project includes enhancing course materials and delivery, advising and training of graduate students, undergraduate research, underrepresented groups, K-12 outreach, and international collaboration.<br/><br/>High-field (HF) MRI scanners are referring to the main static magnetic field (generated by magnet) from 3 T to 7 T, while ultra-high field (UHF) is 7 T and above. The proposed approach and novel method for multi-channel excitation of RF magnetic fields is based on subject-loaded multifilar helical-antenna RF volume coils for HF and UHF MRI, to advance RF coil designs at both 3 T (current best, yet to be advanced and broadly adopted at clinics and hospitals) and 7 T (expected next major clinical overhaul in the near future, yet with lots of unknowns and challenges). The novelty of this approach consists of using the inner volume of the helix coil to excite the target sample. Preliminary MRI data obtained in phantoms at 7 T with 4- and 8-channel helix coils demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach, with consistency between experimental results and numerical simulations. Preliminary simulations at 3 T show that the helical-antenna exciter provides better RF-field uniformity and larger field of view than other reported results, with comparable transmit efficiencies. The project will pursue characterization, evaluation, and advancement of multi-channel helix RF coils at 3T and 7 T, respectively. Based on the obtained results, it will develop, optimize, and realize coils for 4.7 T operation, chosen for this proposed research midway between 3 T and 7 T, with RF efficiency, specific absorption rate distribution, and spatial RF-field encoding quantified in phantom experiments and in simulations. Principal goals are to provide improved RF performance while potentially preserving the easiness of use for a volume coverage coil, to determine the potential gains offered by the proposed new coil structures, and to further advance them closer to preclinical medical research and realization for clinical practice on a more global scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to develop new methodologies to classify viable domain-specific systemic performance, risk, and fragility measures for dynamical networks and quantify inherent fundamental limits on the best achievable values for each class of such systemic measures. The main barrier to achieve this objective is the lack of rigorous knowledge about networks of interconnected dynamical systems when it comes to understanding their structure, dynamics and holistic behaviors. <br/><br/>The issue of fundamental limits and their resulting tradeoffs are important for synthesis of dynamical network as they reveal what is achievable, and conversely what is not achievable by feedback control mechanisms.

The combination of metals and dielectrics offers unprecedentedly small volumes, fast speeds, and enhancements to nonlinear effects in photonic devices such as light sources, waveguides, and switches.  Generally, however, the incorporation of metals necessarily increases the energy dissipated as heat in such devices, consequently reducing the energy carried by useful signals. We propose to create metal-dielectric and metal-semiconductor composites with the primary goal of demonstrating optical signal transmission without energy loss.  Semiconducting materials may be engineered to emit and absorb light over a very broad color range, and their properties may be tuned by external electronics. We aim to develop the theoretical underpinning and experimental knowledge on the role of active semiconductors in enabling propagation of optical signals without loss of energy, while still retaining the small footprint and fast operation of the metal-dielectric-based photonic devices. We additionally plan to explore, both theoretically and experimentally, the enhancement of nonlinear effects in such devices, due both to the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields and to the cascaded nonlinearities present at the interfaces between the constituent materials.<br/> <br/>(Technical) <br/>Hyperbolic metamaterials offer unique and enhanced functionalities compared to conventional optical materials.  For example, hyperbolic metamaterials exhibit highly localized electric fields in deeply subwavelength volumes, enabling field-enhanced nonlinear polarization, as well as broadband Purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate.  By introducing external strain, the band-structure of the constituent materials can be further modified, enabling multi-scale engineering of the hyperbolic metamaterials's linear and nonlinear optical responses.  Unfortunately, hyperbolic metamaterials typically suffer from considerable Ohmic losses, preventing their applicability to practical devices. To overcome this deficiency, optical gain may be introduced for improved device performance. To date, most research on gain-compensated metamaterials has focused on dye molecules as a gain medium because they are easy to incorporate in proof-of-concept experiments and can be accurately modeled using simple two-level systems. In contrast, inorganic semiconductors and their heterostructures are attractive as gain media because their absorption/emission resonances may be engineered from terahertz to ultraviolet frequencies. Additionally, semiconductor hyperbolic metamaterials may be electrically injected with charge carriers, allowing for a more direct and reliable control of their functionality. And lastly, inorganic semiconductors offer distinct advantages over dyes in terms of robustness, lifetime, and integrability with guided wave devices. The overall goal of this proposal is to advance the science and technology of Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials.  Specifically, we aim to comprehensively understand and experimentally demonstrate: (1) lossless propagation in waveguide-based Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials, (2) field-enhanced second- and third-order nonlinear effects in Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials, and (3) strain-enhanced nonlinear effects in Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials, all mediated by semiconductor gain.  For specificity, we focus on the near-infrared part of the spectrum, but we stress that the lessons learned from our work may easily be extended to ultraviolet and terahertz frequencies alike.  <br/>Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials offer an avenue for achieving unprecedented nonlinear conversion efficiencies with lossless signal transmission.  Due to their extremely small footprint and potentially fast operation, Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials will become strong candidates for integrated nonlinear devices of future photonic circuits.  The proposed research will not only advance the basic science and technology of active semiconductor metamaterials, but will also set an example for the investigation of physical phenomena in which the self-consistent treatment of electronic, electromagnetic, and mechanical interaction becomes crucially important.  We anticipate that Gain Enhanced Multifunctional Metamaterials will find applications in data- and telecommunications, graph-processing, computation, biomedical imaging, and chemical sensing."

Optical technologies have enabled us to record and infer neural activity with single-cell resolution. However, they are limited by low temporal resolution, and often fail to accurately capture the neural dynamics at the milli-second time scales. Electrophysiology, on the other hand, provides higher temporal resolution, but single-cell electrophysiology usually suffers from low throughput, and recordings that cover larger spatial scales suffer from poor spatial resolution, making it difficult to decipher neural activity at cellular scale from large areas. Realizing that micro-scale optical imaging and macro-scale electrophysiological recording possess complementary strengths in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, this multidisciplinary project will combine the two recording modalities using innovations in neural engineering, multi-modal imaging and signal processing, to understand neural activity at previously unattained temporal and spatial resolution. Such a capability will lead to new discoveries on information processing in the brain and circuit dysfunctions for neurological disorders (epilepsy, depression, memory disorders, etc.), affecting one billion people worldwide. Recording and resolving neural activity with enhanced resolution can drive the development of next-generation of brain computer interfaces for restoring vision, hearing, and movement. The outcomes of this project will also be integrated into developing interdisciplinary educational materials for training the next generation of neuroengineers, neuroscientists and signal processing experts. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>The project has three main technical components that consist of development of novel electrode arrays, careful design of multi-modal imaging experiments, and advanced signal processing techniques for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Simultaneous multiphoton imaging and electrophysiology experiments enabled by novel electrode arrays will generate brand new datasets which will be processed by new data-driven super-resolution algorithms that judiciously exploit the complementary strengths of the two imaging modalities. The key idea is to cast the fusion problem within the mathematical framework of bilinear problems, and exploit sparsity of the underlying neural activity as a key ingredient in solving the inverse problem by fusing the datasets obtained from optical and electrophysiological recordings. The mathematical principles and algorithms used for creating super-resolution images by fusing signals with complementary attributes have broader applicability beyond neural imaging, and can be used for developing more efficient solutions for ill-posed inverse problems that arise in diverse imaging applications."

Simply exciting the sample with a magnetic wave at its resonance frequency, yields a signal.  However, weak signal strength and months-long searches for resonances in unstudied materials prevent ready adoption of this inexpensive and simple technique, known as nuclear quadrupole resonance.  Quantum magnetometers, with sensitivities better than standard coil detectors, help with the former problem, but will, with this project, be developed to increase the search speed, potentially five orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method.  Despite the difficulty of discovering new resonance lines, researchers have pursued the use of quadrupole resonance for substance detection in a few applications of critical importance for security and society; in particular, the detection of explosives and the identification of counterfeit from real medicine at checkpoints. The adoption of quadrupole resonance for checkpoint and standards applications would greatly expand if resonance lines could be quickly identified for new materials.  In addition to national security benefits, the project will improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics education within George Mason by forging strong ties between the Electrical Engineering and Physics Departments through revitalized laboratory courses. Furthermore, by creating undergraduate internship projects focused on K-12 educational experiences, fledgling science teachers will be nurtured and seeds of a diverse and competitive technology and engineering workforce will be planted.<br/><br/>Atomic magnetometers are fundamentally different sensors than coils.  The use of optically aligned atoms as the detection medium and optical read-out of the sensor with a laser gives a better detection sensitivity than coils; noise in the magnetometer is fundamentally limited by quantum fluctuations.   Moreover, the operating frequency of the magnetometer can easily be changed to match the frequency of the excitation with a small static magnetic field.  In light of these advantages, the excitation frequency can be swept continuously, as opposed to pulsed excitation at a single operating frequency, obviating the need for a point by point search.  With pulsed excitation the material must return to an equilibrium condition before another signal is acquired; often long wait times are required between data acquisitions.  However by sweeping up through higher frequencies, then back down to the original frequency, the material is automatically returned to equilibrium.  In this way, the long wait times that compromise the effectiveness of standard pulse techniques is avoided.  As part of the project, the following goals will be met: <br/>1) Magnetometer cells with an active volume of 2 cm3 will be designed and constructed.  The resulting magnetometer will have sub-femtoTesla sensitivity. The small volume is critical for the practical implementation of the resonance search with a limited quantity of material.<br/><br/>2) Continuously tuning the magnetometer to a changing frequency will not alter its sensitivity.<br/><br/>3) The sensitivity of the magnetometer can be retained while resonant excitation on the order of a 100 micro Tesla is applied to a sample a couple centimeters away. Coil geometry and common mode rejection schemes using a second magnetometer will be employed.<br/><br/>4) If the above three goals are achieved, the search speed for resonance frequencies can be improved by as much as five orders of magnitude over conventional techniques."

The research while advancing science and technology for a societal need, will provide invaluable experience for students as they will be trained to work in an interdisciplinary environment. Furthermore, the outreach activities will educate pre-college students how advanced science and engineering can be merged to solve real, current problems.<br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to develop rapid odor detector implemented by merging the significant concepts in electronic noses and fast gas chromatography (GC) into a small footprint. The focus of this system is the uniquely designed chromatographic chip with multiple capillaries working in parallel.  The chip will be fabricated in silicon using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology and will be functionalized using ionic liquids. The major processing steps include deep reactive ion etching followed by silicon-glass anodic bonding. The proposed chromatographic chip will be interfaced with a detector or multiple detectors to generate a rapid odor-print of the sample.   The output will be an array of chromatographic responses which will be analyzed using advanced multivariate statistical and pattern recognition algorithms to determine if the food sample has been adulterated.  The statistical method can simultaneously perform a variable selection in nonadditive multivariate nonparametric model for analyzing the large data generated by the chip.   Olive oil and honey which have been the target of adulteration will be used to validate the technology.  It is expected that the new odor detector will achieve a total analysis time of less than a minute which is orders of magnitude faster and more economical when compared to established techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)."

To achieve this goal, the proposed research explores the possibilities to build magnetic memory devices based on magnetic skyrmions for room-temperature applications featuring in nonvolatile, high density and low-power consumption. A magnetic skyrmion is a particle-like, topologically protected magnetic domain. As a nonvolatile information carrier, each individual skyrmion in a memory device can enable high-density, low-power operations due to the small size, the low driving current density and the extra topological protection. The proposed research will establish a framework for magnetic memory devices using topologically protected spin texture as the information carrier. The impact will be transformative and thus enables the construction of novel magnetic memory. The high-density memory will help accelerate the progress of the big data and internet-of-things era. Meanwhile, when integrated with the CMOS semiconductor technology, it potentially resolves the energy dissipation challenge and thus further advances the technology node. Additionally, this interdisciplinary research also has a vast educational impact, as the new knowledge from the spin orbit coupling engineering will have emerging educational meaning for new students. Students with education level from high school to undergraduate/graduate students, and postdocs (including women and minorities) will be exposed and trained in this inter- and multi-disciplinary and emerging fields of physical science and engineering as well as computer science through PI's participation of the high school and freshman outreach programs at UCLA. The training of students in these emerging disciplines will provide diverse human capital, versed in scientific method and experienced in the applications. The educational impact is further amplified by current outreach programs through the California NanoSystems and the NSF-ERC on Translational Applications of Nanoscale Multiferroic Systems.<br/><br/>Although skyrmions can intrinsically exist in a group of so-called helimagnetic materials (B-20) compounds, skyrmions in magnetic multilayers or interfaces will be more compatible with existing magnetic recording/memory technologies. Thus, the proposed project focuses on the study of skyrmion creation, manipulation and detection in ferromagnetic layer/heavy-material (FM/HM) thin-film systems. This system provides the possibility to furthest adjust and tune the skyrmion properties for application purposes. The creation and annihilation of single, individual skyrmions will be experimentally realized and theoretically analyzed dynamically and statically. The manipulation of skyrmions can be controlled by currents via spin-orbit torque coming from the relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Each individual skyrmion can be detected using magnetoresistance effect via magnetic tunnel junctions. Single spin textures of single Skyrmions will be modeled via micromagnetic simulation.  Knowledge and experience learnt from this study will enable electrically encoding and decoding of information; the use of commonly accessible thin film material systems with low-temperature process in this research automatically ensures devices to be fully compatible with current CMOS or magnetic recording technology. The proposed research is transformative since it invokes many unique innovations from (1) interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in FM/HM heterostructures to create skyrmion with controllable sizes; (2) effectively manipulation of skyrmion motion by the current-induced spin-orbit torque at the FM/HM interface; (3) the use of high-quality MTJ for information encoding and detection; (4) nanostructure engineering and voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA)."

The research objective of this program is to explore how the information gathering capabilities of cryogenic sensor systems can be improved by an order of magnitude through novel combinations of ultra-low-power silicon circuits and superconducting sensors. Two different system applications will be studied: terahertz superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixer focal plane arrays and near-infrared superconducting nanowire single photon detector cameras.

These systems allow scientists to push measurements towards the limits of fundamental physics, and thus have had a profound impact on experimental science.

Finally, low-temperature electronics is a field in which there is limited expertise, and the training of new experts who understand the applications of these systems will help to ensure that forward progress continues in the years to come. To this end, a set of yearly scientific site visits will be organized in which graduate and undergraduate researchers will have the opportunity to present their research results to leading scientists and to learn about ongoing work at some of the nations premier research institutions."

Radio waves that are said to carry non-zero Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) are more like the swirling vortices that develop as water drains from a sink.  The OAM property of these vortex waves provides an additional dimension for transmitting information. This research will investigate antenna array analog filtering methods that can extract the OAM information from a received signal despite the presence of electromagnetic interference and noise. Mathematical filter design techniques, founded on topology and multi-dimensional signal processing, will be realized using complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based recursive filters, which will enable high-frequency, continuous-time data extraction.  Circuit theory will be created for use in designing RF vortex wave array processors that have multi-GHz bandwidth for challenging realizations in the microwave and millimeter-wave range. This work provides a new technique for exploiting an unused design dimension.  Apart from providing communications engineers with a new means of physically realizing OAM-multiplexing, the results of this effort might offer paradigm-changing solutions for improving imaging and encryption technologies. Such technologies could impact medical, telecommunications, and defense industries as well as radio astronomy and atmospheric science.  This knowledge will be distributed through outreach activitie at conferences and meetings. The project includes a female PI and will involve participation from underrepresented groups. There will be summer STEM workshops for high-school girls at both the University of Akron and the University of Texas at Dallas.  Lab open houses will educate the public of the possible merits of this project for future wireless systems.<br/><br/>Vortex modes are orthogonal to each other despite occupying the same carrier frequency and bandwidth, allowing independent encoding of information. OAM-multiplexing allows encoding with overlapped radio bandwidth. The project explores array-processing schemes for electronically tuning onto desired vortex modes using array processing and analog RF integrated circuits (ICs). Filter design techniques founded on curvilinear multi-dimensional signal processing are proposed for vortex-wave array processing using recursive filters, leading to high frequency continuous-time RF CMOS realizations.  Circuit theory will be created for use in designing RF vortex wave array processors that have multi-GHz bandwidth for challenging realizations in the microwave and millimeter-wave range. Design methodologies and techniques for analog realizations will result from theoretical analysis, circuit synthesis, simulation and modeling of the vortex signal processors. To circumvent the problem of scattering of incoming signals, the project explores novel subwavelength antennas that minimize radio wave reflections by virtue of their smallness and the fact that the characteristic impedance of the antenna material will be engineered so as to achieve impedance matching with free space. This work will take advantage of the cross-coupled electric, magnetic and acoustic properties of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials (to be realized using polymer nanocomposites) to drastically enhance the performance of electrically small antennas.  Conversion between electromagnetic and acoustic energy is advantageous because a signal of a particular frequency will have a much shorter acoustic wavelength than that of a radio wave."

However, the amount of available spectrum has not kept up. As the use of spectrum becomes increasingly condensed, it is critical to develop new technologies to improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization. Technologies that can better utilize the limited resources of frequency, time, and energy are needed to enable highly versatile and frequency-agile dynamic spectrum access. The proposed project develops a unique approach termed Dynamic Space Frequency Multiplexing (DSFM) for dynamic spectrum access by optimizing space and frequency utilization in physical-layer and integrating with novel channel coding, multiple access control (MAC) layer and coded caching designs to maximize spectral and energy efficiency. Successful execution of this project will improve spectral efficiency by at least an order of magnitude. The proposed design is posed to meet future 5G challenges such as cell densification and massive Internet-of-things (IoT) due to its great flexibility in supporting multiuser asynchronous communication. This project will provide valuable research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Outcomes of this project will also be tightly integrated into classroom teaching and outreach.<br/><br/>The proposed DSFM design builds upon two complementary technologies -- filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) for frequency multiplexing and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) for spatial multiplexing. FBMC has superior spectral property to that of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) due to a flexible prototype filter whose locality in both time and frequency can be controlled. The emerging technology of massive MIMO offers complementary benefits to that of FBMC through spatial multiplexing. It enables a crucial self-equalization property for FBMC systems that allows for great flexibility in the allocation of subcarrier bandwidth in accordance to dynamic spectrum availability. On the other hand, FBMC offers effective frequency multiplexing needed for practical massive MIMO systems.  The proposed DSFM design will maximize mutual benefits of FBMC and massive MIMO and thus is an exceptional candidate for both spectrum efficient and energy efficient dynamic spectrum access. This project is highly innovative in that it develops (1) novel adaptive prototype filter designs that enable self-equalization of FBMC for massive MIMO networks; (2) hybrid beamforming architectures to improve energy efficiency; (3) low complexity channel coding and decoding algorithms for high spectral and energy efficiency communications; (4) cache-aided DSFM carrier aggregation for improving spectral and energy efficiency; (5) DSFM-enabled dynamic MAC layer schemes; (6) city-scale testbed validation using the National Science Foundation (NSF) Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many practical applications, it is required that these waves propagate through nonreciprocal channels/devices able to exhibit different responses when source and observation points are interchanged. This is the case of isolators that protect sources and antennas from high-power reflections, circulators able to distribute signals to different outputs, or Faraday rotators that control the polarization of light. These components are fundamental building blocks for telecommunications, defense, health care, and space industries. Unfortunately, breaking reciprocity usually requires bulky and costly magnetic materials that are not compatible with integrated circuits. This project proposes novel approaches to break and engineer reciprocity at the micro/nano-scale by exploiting exciting properties of two-dimensional materials without requiring external magnetic fields. The findings will be applied to develop low-cost, compact, and highly-efficient nonreciprocal platforms that enable novel functionalities and are compatible with integrated circuits and other optoelectronic components. The main goal is to establish a new paradigm for nonreciprocal devices, lessening the dependence on magnetic materials and exploiting unusual responses to reshape many areas of the coming technology. The educational and outreach efforts will focus on engaging Hispanic students, ranging from K-12 to college, in science, technology, engineering and math. Summer fellowships will foster the participation of undergraduate Hispanic students in a research project about nonreciprocal antennas, allowing graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to interact and share knowledge and experiences learnt by implementing similar concepts at different frequencies.

This platform will permit to investigate the response of many systems under effective magnetic bias much larger than those attained in common laboratories and will enable the practical development of strain engineering. Such responses will be applied to realize Faraday rotators and nonreciprocal hyperbolic/phase profile metasurfaces, enabling functionalities such as one way giant optical forces and nonreciprocal beam steering/lensing. Second, the ultrafast field effect of two-dimensional materials will be exploited to judiciously modulate in space and time their electric properties. Spatiotemporal modulations will be applied to realize low-loss, efficient, and integrated nonreciprocal photonic and plasmonic platforms able to enhance the spectrum efficiency and data-rate in the telecommunication industry.

It has enabled electronic data (0s and 1s) to be directly written onto light pulses that travel the globe and essentially form the backbone of the internet. It is also used to change the color of light emitted by lasers, of importance for high-speed computing and sensing, as well as to enable realization of novel quantum sources of light that may enable next-generation ultra-secure optical communications. However, currently the performance of lithium-niobate based optical devices is limited by their bulky size. This project aims to miniaturize these to the nanoscale by patterning lithium-niobate onto a photonic microchip, thereby enhancing their efficiency many-fold. This will enable the design of novel light sources with greatly improved properties compared to current technology and also significantly reduce the optical power requirements. The proposed research program is a natural template for informing students, teachers, and the public of how scientists and engineers explore the unique behavior of materials at the nanoscale, and make use of these properties in the creation of new devices. The team will leverage the ""magic"" of optics and lasers to engage a wide audience and inform the public of their ongoing research. The program has strong theoretical and experimental components and addresses both fundamental and engineering aspects of light-generation in nanoscale optical devices and systems. Therefore, it represents a unique research and educational opportunity for students at all levels. The devices and systems that will be developed will be of great interest to both the scientific community and commercial industry.<br/>Abstract (technical): Lithium-niobate, with its large second-order susceptibility, relatively large refractive index and wide transmission window extending from ultra-violet to mid-infrared, is one of the most important optoelectronic materials, widely used for electro-optic modulation and classical & quantum optical frequency conversion. However, due to difficulties associated with fabrication, most of these components are discrete and cannot be easily integrated onto a photonic microchip. Fortunately, recent advances in lithium-niobate thin-film fabrication techniques, via crystal ion slicing, are promising and enable chip-scale integration of nanophotonic devices. The proposed program builds on these results and seeks to develop an integrated nonlinear nanophotonics platform that combines the unique material properties of periodically-poled lithium-niobate with the superior light confinement and dispersion engineering in wavelength-scale optical waveguides and cavities. The new platform will be developed based on thin x-cut lithium-niobate device layers (~500-nm thick) bonded on top of a SiO2 substrate that provides optical isolation. The team will develop new techniques for surface poling of thin x-cut lithium-niobate films, thus allowing for efficient phase matching. State of the art nanofabrication techniques will be used to realize optical waveguides and cavities directly in the periodically-poled device layer. The devices will operate over a wide wavelength range (visible to mid-infrared) and enable strong photon interactions resulting in 40-fold more efficient nonlinear processes than those found in conventional counterparts. The program is expected to result in a wide variety of integrated devices and systems with applications in quantum frequency conversion, entangled-photon pair generation, supercontinuum generation, and frequency comb generation.

The neuro-inspired architecture leverages the distributed computation in the neuron nodes and the localized storage in the synaptic elements. The neuron node today is generally implemented by tens of silicon transistors. Compared to the crossbar array of synaptic elements, the silicon neuron is power-hungry and area-inefficient, thereby reducing the parallelism of computing system. In such context, how to design a single device that can efficiently emulate the neuronal behavior (e.g. integrate-and-fire) is critical to the neuromorphic hardware design. This project aims to exploit the metal-insulator-transition phenomenon in strongly correlated oxides as a compact neuron node that can self-oscillate, namely oxide neuron, to overcome the aforementioned limitations of silicon neuron. The proposed research will have a profound impact on the society that is embracing the artificial intelligence. For instance, a compact design of neuromorphic hardware may enable intelligent information processing on power-efficient mobile platforms, e.g. autonomous vehicle, personalized healthcare, wearable devices, and smart sensors. The objective of the research and education integration is to train undergraduate/graduate students and next-generation workforce with interdisciplinary skills. The cross-layer nature of this project ranging from materials engineering, semiconductor device, circuit-device interaction and artificial neural network provides an ideal platform for this educational goal. The project also plans to engage minority and unrepresentative students in research. Technology transfer will be performed through video or on-site seminars and student internships with industrial collaborators.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this research is to advance the artificial neuron device design by exploiting the volatile and threshold switching behavior in strongly correlated oxides, with the purpose of significantly reducing the area and energy of the neuron node, and making it compatible for the integration with crossbar array of resistive synaptic elements. The scope of the project is to explore various material systems of the strongly correlated oxides, in particular, NbO2 and SmNiO3 to demonstrate the self-oscillation behavior in the artificial neuron node. When such oxide device is connected with a series synaptic element whose resistance is within the on/off dynamic range of the oxide device, the node voltage between the oxide device and the synaptic element will start self-oscillation, and the oscillation frequency represents the synaptic conductance. This project aims to explore such self-oscillation to emulate the integrate-and-fire neuronal behavior. To achieve the aforementioned research goal, device fabrication, physical and electrical characterization, device modeling, and circuit-device co-design will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and further optimize the device performance. The intellectual significance of this project is two folded. From the fundamental science perspective, the physical switching mechanism of metal-insulator-transition in strongly correlated oxides will be investigated. From the applied engineering perspective, the oxide neuron device will be integrated with the resistive crossbar array for demonstration of a neural network for solving a practical problem, i.e. the image pattern classification."

This research proposes to develop a method of creating at least 30 unique labels that can be used to label up to 30 cells or bio species. Most labeling techniques also require observation of individual cells, which can be time consuming for large samples or inaccurate if fast image processing is used. Our approach combines magnetic nanowire technology with radio frequency technology to characterize and detect unique nanowire strand systems. We use radio frequency signals to measure the ferromagnetic resonance properties of the magnetic material. By detecting the zero DC magnetic bias ferromagnetic resonance, we can read out 30 nanowires simultaneously based on the material properties of the nanowires set. This solution will revolutionize diagnostics and multi-cell medical research. <br/>Similar to the leap from barcodes to QR codes, these nanowires and nanowire arrays will provide a quantum leap to nano-medicine because large samples (e.g. tissues or whole vials) will be multiplexed so that ratios of labels can be detected simultaneously.

The RF signal will be observed as a sharp null in the signal frequency response corresponding to a specific ferromagnetic material.  These studies are essential to determine the specific signature of the RF signal and material system, whereby leading to a unique methods for characterizing magnetic nanowires outside of the manufacturing environment. The proposed research will involve design and synthesis of the nanowires (e.g. 10-200 nm in diameter and 0-100 microns long) as well as characterization of material properties using custom high speed chip diagnostic systems to evaluate single and mixed material systems based on static and dynamic magnetic behavior. Feedback from the nanowire diagnostics will be used to re-design solutions that will allow determination of FMR frequency shifts.

One of the intellectual contributions is the development of efficient wideband beamformers based on sparse factorizations of delay Vandermonde matrices (DVM). This DVM algorithm solves the longstanding ""beam squint"" problem, i.e., the fact that the beam direction changes with input frequency, making true wideband operation impossible. Another is the derivation of transform matrices with specified properties that approximate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Such approximate transforms are not subjected to the known computational complexity bounds of the exact DFT, and approximate-DFT-based multi-beamformers can in fact be efficiently implemented using current-mode analog ICs.

Polar codes, a recent breakthrough in the theory of error correction codes, are the first practical error correction codes that are asymptotically optimal in the sense of channel capacity. Their asymptotically optimal performance and low error floor make them promising candidates for future storage and communication systems. However, existing polar decoders suffer from inferior finite length error performance, long decoding delay, and inefficient hardware implementations. These issues form important obstacles to the adoption of polar codes in practice. Jointly addressing these interplaying challenges, the proposed research is a comprehensive investigation of polar decoders from the perspectives of error performance, complexity, delay, and hardware implementation, based on an integrated framework that harnesses the intricate relation between algorithms, their complexities and delays, and their hardware implementations.<br/><br/>The proposed research aims to devise new polar decoders that not only achieve superior error performance but also have reduced delay, low complexities, and efficient hardware implementations. To this end, the objectives of the proposed research include: 1) New decoding algorithms for polar codes with improved performance and reduced complexity and delay; 2) Efficient architectures and hardware implementations of polar decoders; 3) Analytical, numerical and experimental performance evaluation of the proposed polar decoders, including a field-programmable gate array emulation platform. <br/><br/>The proposed research tackles several key open research problems, such as error performance analysis of symbol-decision polar decoders, how to optimize the schedule of belief propagation decoding of polar codes, and belief propagation decoding of polar codes on over-complete factor graphs.

Wireless communication will be critical in providing IoT connectivity.  There are three main strategic directions that are envisioned in the future wireless networking. First, enhanced mobile broadband will result in even larger data rates for future 3D applications such as virtual reality. Second, Smart City/Community applications require large number of sensors that communicate sporadically over large urban or rural areas in a scalable, asynchronous, and energy efficient manner. The previous two directions, while important, are not the focus of our proposal. Instead, our proposal focuses on low-latency and ultra-reliable communications and networking that is critical for latency-sensitive, closed-loop control applications, like vehicle to vehicle communications, collaborative swam planning, and industrial control. In such latency sensitive applications, we need to rethink the networking stack, coding, networking architecture, and control design to enable communications and networking that can provide ultra-low latency (99.999%). This is far beyond what is currently possible. But even more importantly, we do not know what is possible and what are the fundamental limits for control system design over low-latency, high-reliability communications.<br/><br/>In this proposal, we will be rethinking the scientific foundations for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communications for latency sensitive control applications. We propose to achieve our scientific agenda by addressing three intellectual challenges: 1) Low-latency channel coding, where the goal is to focus on short packet codes for control loops 2) Control over low latency-aware communication channels, where the goal is to understand the what is the optimal tradeoff of latency to reliability for control loops and 3) Learning for Large Scale Wireless Control Networks, where machine learning will perform resource allocation for large numbers of control loops with competing latency/reliability requirements We intend to evaluate the proposed research agenda by leveraging our existing Intel Science and Technology Center (ISTC) on Wireless Autonomous Systems and demonstrate our ideas in future wireless protocols (IEEE 802.11ax) and experimentally demonstrate it in high-speed V2V and fast formation control with aerial swarms.  On the educational front, the University of Pennsylvania is planning to offer a Micro-Masters program in Internet of Things (IoT) on the edX MOOC platform. Longer term, our goal is to create a new community of researchers that focus on control over low-latency wireless networks for IoT devices.

These technologies have experienced exponential growth over the past several decades, thanks to the aggressive scaling of electronic devices. Next-generation information technologies, however, cannot be supported by only scaling transistors, and will rely heavily on data centers and cloud computing to drive performance improvements. We are already experiencing this trend with the increased investment from large technology companies in these sectors. To support this architecture, we need to bring optical interconnect technology (i.e., fiber optics), which is the backbone of the modern internet, to shorter length scales. Going beyond classical computing and communication technologies, quantum mechanics presents an opportunity to realize a paradigm shift in information technology. All these technologies, however, require ultra-low power optoelectronic devices; the power requirement is almost four orders of magnitude lower than that of existing devices. In my research, I aim to create these devices using atomically thin materials integrated with silicon nitride photonic circuits. Specifically, we aim to develop an optical modulator and optical switch, that can change light transmission using minimal power. These devices will be fabricated using well-developed semiconductor manufacturing technology. Along with developing new technology, the proposal aims to incorporate a design-build-test module in existing lecture-based nanophotonics courses to provide hands-on experience to the next-generation knowledge workers in the field of integrated photonics.<br/><br/>Technical Description: Ultra-low-power tunable and nonlinear optical devices hold the key for numerous optical technologies including optoelectronic information processing, communication, and photonic quantum simulations of strongly correlated materials. Currently, the power required to modulate the light transmission through photonic devices or to observe a nonlinear input-output response is too high. This power can be reduced by spatially confining the electronic and photonic wave functions to a nanometer-length scale for an extended period of time. Nanophotonic resonators integrated with emerging low-dimensional materials present an attractive platform to create ultra-low-power optoelectronic devices. To that end, this proposal aims to integrate van der Waals (vdW) materials (e.g., graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides) and their heterostructures with silicon nitride nano-resonators. The choice of silicon nitride is motivated by its large bandgap and compatibility with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing. The vdW materials are chosen for their unique quantum properties, large exciton binding energies, and atomic thinness that enable extremely small active volumes and unprecedented material compatibility; they can be transferred onto any substrate without requiring explicit lattice matching. Combining numerical simulation, device fabrication, and optical characterization, three research aims will be pursued: (i) develop an experiment-driven model for vdW material?cavity coupling; (ii) demonstrate optical nonlinearity at the few photon level in a coupled cavity array, and (iii) create an electro-optic modulator with attojoule electrical energy per switching. While the initial applications of these devices will be in ultra-low-power classical optical information science, the same platform can be used for developing quantum technologies, including quantum many-body simulations and quantum signal transduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fish movement data provide insight into choice of habitats, migratory routes, and spawning behavior. By advancing the state of the art in fish tracking technology, this project enables better-informed decisions for fishery management and conservation, including control of invasive species, restoration of native species, and stock assessment for high-valued species, and ultimately contributes to the sustainability of fisheries and aquatic ecosystems. By advancing the coordination and control of gliding robotic fish networks and enabling their operation in challenging environments such as the Great Lakes, the project also facilitates the practical adoption of these robotic systems for a myriad of other applications in environmental monitoring, port surveillance, and underwater structure inspection. The project enhances several graduate courses at Michigan State University, and provides unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for students including those from underrepresented groups.

This goal is realized through the pursuit of five tightly coupled research objectives associated with the application of tracking and modeling fish movement: (1) developing new robotic platforms to enable underwater communication and acoustic tag detection, (2) developing robust algorithms with analytical performance assurance to localize tagged fish based on time-of-arrival differences among multiple robots, (3) designing hidden Markov models and online model adaptation algorithms to capture fish movement effectively and efficiently, (4) exploring a two-tier decision architecture for the robots to accomplish fish tracking, which incorporates model-predictions of fish movement, energy consumption, and mobility constraints, and (5) experimentally evaluating the design framework, first in an inland lake for localizing or tracking stationary and moving tags, and then in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron, for tracking and modeling the movement of lake trout during spawning. This project offers fundamental insight into the design of robust robotic-physical-biological systems that addresses the challenges of system uncertainties and competing objectives. First, a feedback paradigm is presented for tight interactions between the robotic and biological components, to facilitate the refinement of biological knowledge and robotic strategies in the presence of uncertainties. Second, tools from estimation and control theory (e.g., Cramer-Rao bounds) are exploited in novel ways to analyze the performance limits of fish tracking algorithms, and to guide the design of optimal or near-optimal tradeoffs to meet multiple competing objectives while accommodating onboard resource constraints. On the biology side, continuous, dynamic tracking of tagged fish with robotic networks represents a significant step forward in acoustic telemetry, and results in novel datasets and models for advancing fish movement ecology."

To circumvent the problem of scattering of incoming signals, the project explores novel subwavelength antennas that minimize radio wave reflections by virtue of their smallness and the fact that the characteristic impedance of the antenna material will be engineered so as to achieve impedance matching with free space. This work will take advantage of the cross-coupled electric, magnetic and acoustic properties of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials (to be realized using polymer nanocomposites) to drastically enhance the performance of electrically small antennas.  Conversion between electromagnetic and acoustic energy is advantageous because a signal of a particular frequency will have a much shorter acoustic wavelength than that of a radio wave."

PI Madanayake will collaborate with co-PIs towards mentoring underrepresented students towards careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).  The proposal team is uniquely placed to promote STEM topics spanning both electrical engineering and mathematics domains. The project will lead to education of the wider community on the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration. Further, the team will strive to show the importance of learning deeper math topics towards success in technology and engineering careers.<br/><br/><br/>A multi-beam array receiver is deeply difficult to realize in IC form due to the underlying complexity of its signal flow graph. In this work, mathematical methods based on the theories of i) sparse factorization of structured complex matrices, and ii) approximate transforms are proposed to solve this problem. The resulting matrices are realized with multi-GHz bandwidths using analog ICs. One of the intellectual contributions is the development of efficient wideband beamformers based on sparse factorizations of delay Vandermonde matrices (DVM). This DVM algorithm solves the longstanding ""beam squint"" problem, i.e., the fact that the beam direction changes with input frequency, making true wideband operation impossible. Another is the derivation of transform matrices with specified properties that approximate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Such approximate transforms are not subjected to the known computational complexity bounds of the exact DFT, and approximate-DFT-based multi-beamformers can in fact be efficiently implemented using current-mode analog ICs. Finally, precision circuit design, digital calibration, built-in self-test, and other methods will be explored for efficiently realizing the proposed multi-beamforming networks in analog IC form."

Importantly, silicon photonics is compatible with modern electronics technology on which everyday integrated circuit chips for computers and communications are based. Motivating this project, there is a need for useful and economic means for silicon-based light generation for silicon photonics technology. We plan to fill this void by engaging a unique optical resonance effect on nanostructured silicon films to generate light. Thus, we propose to develop new active devices, namely lasers and amplifiers, enabled by this fundamental effect. This can lead to new types of lasers serving as sources for silicon photonic chips as well as amplifiers for enhanced detection of incoming signals carried by light pulses as used in internet data transmission. Integrated photonic systems are expected to increase transmission and processing rates in optical communications. Under the project, we will evaluate the utility of fundamental photonic resonance effects, thus far not applied for this purpose, to enable advanced light generation in silicon. The project provides excellent analytical and experimental experience for graduate students thus supporting the development of the next-generation workforce in photonics technology. If successful, the project will led to innovative light generation and amplification concepts with substantial economic benefits and societal value. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and characterize a new class of active nanophotonic guided-mode resonance elements. Specifically, we will investigate Raman amplifiers and lasers enabled by this effect. The research is motivated by the fact that Raman emission can be enhanced to high levels with these high-quality-factor resonance effects that are attainable in nanopatterned silicon films. We present preliminary device designs where the spectral placement of the pump and Raman lasing wavelengths achieves the proper Stokes-Raman shift in silicon. Here, the pump and lasing resonances have large quality factors with corresponding high Raman gain which is dominated by the product of the two factors. These elements will be fashioned as periodic nanostructures in the silicon-on-quartz and the silicon-on-insulator materials systems. We investigate fundamental aspects of the resonance interaction in these devices by computing emission spectra and attendant internal photonic field distributions including local field strengths. The fabricated devices will be characterized by electron-beam and atomic-force microscopy and their detailed spectral properties will be measured. The efficiency of the Stokes-Raman emission, including gain relative to pump, will be quantified relative to device architecture and input pump configuration. This project undertakes fundamental nanophotonic device research that is transformative, if successful, in view of potential applications in silicon photonics."

Magnetic components such as inductors and transformers are typically the largest and usually lossy components in power electronics.

Integrating the two distinctive systems in a synergistic way can potentially combine their merits and circumvent their weakness, to enable applications ranging from chemical and biological sensing to optoelectronics and optical communications. The realization of such a hybrid integration approach with both efficiency and sensitivity, however, is hindered by the large phase mismatching between the different types of optical modes in the two systems, which leads to low coupling efficiency between them. This program aims to solve the problem and achieve a hybrid platform that efficiently integrates nanoplasmonic resonators and silicon photonic waveguides with an emphasis on operation in the technologically important mid-infrared (mid-IR) band. The phase mismatching challenge is resolved innovatively by utilizing the super-coupling effect brought by the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) phenomenon in ring-shaped plasmonic coaxial resonators to achieve waveguide-plasmonics coupling efficiency greater than 90%. The hybrid system enables surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensing, which will be demonstrated with model systems such as lipid bilayer membranes and proteins. There are three-fold intellectual merits of the program. First, the novel physics of super-coupling enabled by the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) phenomenon is explored and utilized to efficiently couple nanoplasmonic resonators with silicon waveguides. The second intellectual merit lies in the research emphasis in the mid-IR band, which is currently experiencing very fast development and is exceedingly powerful for spectroscopic chemical and biological sensing. The third intellectual merit of the program is to achieve SEIRA biosensing. A new reflection mode detection scheme is investigated that avoids the passage of IR light through the solution and thus largely circumvents water absorption. The anticipated significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio would directly lead to enhanced detection sensitivity in SEIRA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Silicon RF photonics and Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) electronics technologies will be explored to implement both spectral- and energy-efficient mm-wave RAUs with small form factors. A successful demonstration of these chip-scale silicon photonics wideband mm-wave RAUs for RoF distributed antenna systems with simultaneous frequency agility and energy efficiency will revolutionize the future of 5G wireless cellular communications and indoor wireless communications (e.g., conference centers, airports, hotels, shopping malls, offices, and homes), and provide further opportunities for the semiconductor industry.

The research and educational results of this work will be disseminated to the academic, industrial, and government sectors.<br/><br/>This project addresses spectral efficiency as its primary goal and energy efficiency as its secondary goal. This project intends to develop novel chip-scale silicon photonics wideband mm-wave front-end architectures as both spectral and energy efficient RAUs for RoF distributed antenna systems using hybrid Silicon on Insulator (SOI) photonics and CMOS chips, and transmit/receive (TX/RX) full-duplex (FD) antenna units. Frequency agility, interference-resilience and spectral efficiency are achieved by employing reconfigurable silicon RF photonics filters and a FD front-end based on TX/RX antennas and CMOS mm-wave integrated circuits. At the same time, energy efficiency is addressed by the proper choice of silicon photonics technology, RF photonics filter topology, and FD front-end architecture. The proposed research tasks are: 1) architecture definition and performance analysis of a mm-wave silicon photonics-CMOS frequency-agile, energy-efficient RAU, 2) development of novel silicon photonics circuits capable of electrical reconfiguration, and relevant algorithms and hardware to provide frequency agility and energy efficiency, 3) implementation and testing of  CMOS prototypes which include the necessary frequency-agile, energy-efficient mm-wave integrated front-end along with the photonics circuit tuning hardware, and 4) hybrid integration of silicon photonics, CMOS chips, and TX/RX antennas and testing of the entire RAU.

Moreover, information is retained in magnetic memories in the absence of power supply, providing possibilities of new computing schemes.  However, existing magnetic memory devices have relatively low operating speed, which greatly limits their application. In this proposal, magnetic memory devices with ultrafast writing speed (<1 nanosecond) will be developed, which can potentially bring in revolutionary changes in memory and data storage industry. The realization of the ultrafast control of magnetic dynamics could also advance understanding on the properties of magnetic materials. In addition to these broad scientific impacts, this project also provides students with unique transdisciplinary training opportunities. This research project is proposed to be integrated with the educational missions, including inspiring career interest of K-12 students in science and engineering; providing undergraduate students with cutting-edge research opportunities; and preparing students for future careers through curriculum development and interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>To realize ultrafast magnetic memories, this proposal tries to leverage the fast development of fabrication techniques on spintronic devices with the recent advancement in new magnetic materials. Particularly, antiferromagnet will be studied for realizing magnetic memories with superior speed and high storage density. Compared with regular ferromagnet, antiferromagnet has ultrafast dynamics due to the high magnetic resonance frequency. However so far the lack of efficient control and detection mechanisms in antiferromagnet has made it challenging for practical implementations of antiferromagnet in magnetic memory devices. In this proposal, the PI focuses on spintronic devices made from antiferromagnet with internally broken inversion symmetry, where the inequality of the two sub-lattices allows the generation of staggered spin orbit torque and provides the possibility for magnetic probing and manipulation. The goals of the proposed experimental efforts include quantitatively determining the writing efficiency as well as exploring and optimizing the reading mechanisms of antiferromagnet. Specifically, a unique scheme for measuring antiferromagnet spin orbit torque is proposed, through which the underlying mechanisms for antiferromagnet switching will be revealed and quantified. Moreover, the switching speed of antiferromagnet devices will also be evaluated and the limiting factors on efficient magnetic switching will be determined through the antiferromagnet domain movement experiment. Finally, a high ON/OFF ratio will be pursued through the study of tunneling anisotropy magnetoresistance, which can lead to an efficient reading mechanism for antiferromagnet devices. In overall, the proposed research activities will not only facilitate the realization of practical antiferromagnet magnetic memory devices with fast accessing time and high density, but also enhance understanding on the current induced dynamics in antiferromagnet and widen awareness of the spin charge interaction in antiferromagnetically coupled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A person with lower-limb amputation relies heavily on a leg prosthesis to support himself/herself and stay mobile.  However, most leg prostheses in current use are unpowered, which can cause great inconvenience.  For example, these unpowered prostheses cannot propel the amputee users forward in walking, and cannot push them up while standing up or climbing stairs.  With the advances in medical robotic technologies, powered robotic leg prostheses are starting to become more common.  These powered prostheses can help amputees to walk more easily and naturally, and also provide power to support activities previously unattainable or extremely difficult with existing unpowered prostheses (such as standing up and stair climbing).  On the other hand, these robotic prostheses are much more complex than the existing unpowered prostheses, so tuning such a prosthesis to fit an individual user is very challenging and time-consuming, requiring numerous office visits with a clinician over a long period of time.  This is one of the main reasons why powered leg prostheses have not gained extensive use among the amputee users.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team will help to solve this problem by developing a new method to automate the prosthesis tuning process.  The main idea is to use a pendant-like wearable sensor to measure upper body motion, which provides rich information about how well the prosthesis is being controlled to help the user to walk and perform other basic tasks of daily life.  The new method will use such information and gradually tune the controller parameters over time without the need for constant clinical supervision.  To develop this method, the researchers will study how an experienced prosthetist tunes the prosthesis parameters and develop an algorithm to mimic this process.  Furthermore, the upper body motion will be used to infer the amputee user's intention more precisely, so the prosthesis can reliably understand what the user intends to do even if he/she changes the motion pattern while learning to use the robotic prosthesis.<br/><br/>By conducting research in this project, the researchers aim to develop a complete Personalized Prosthesis Controller Adaptation (PPCA) system, which provides personalized controller adaption on two levels: 1) automatic motion controller tuning, and 2) automatic intent recognizer adaptation.  The researchers anticipate to make significant contributions to the related scientific areas, including: 1) a novel wearable sensor that incorporates an inertial measurement unit (IMU), capacitive sensing (for sensor-torso relative motion), and advanced signal processing to provide reliable trunk motion information; 2) fundamental understanding of robotic prosthesis-assisted amputee locomotion, and how human expertise-based tuning optimizes its gait quality; 3) a novel quasi-supervised adaptation of classifier-based intent recognizer, which provides the advantages of the traditional supervised learning while avoiding its major weakness (highly effective in adapting to changing human conditions, and no repeated training sessions or human-conducted data labeling required).  Impacts of this project will also be generated by its various education activities, including the introduction of robotic technologies to the future prosthetic clinicians through a renowned prosthetics and orthotics education program, and the creation of hands-on robotic projects in undergraduate research, which can also serve as important tools in the K-12 outreach to attract children at different age groups to the science and engineering fields."

Current state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits triumph over other platforms because of their wafer-scale production where qubits are patterned lithographically with mature circuit fabrication technologies. On the other hand, atom-like solid-state spins constitute an appealing system that simultaneously possesses long coherence times and accessible optical transitions, while allowing for chip-scale integration with other quantum systems. In particular, rare-earth ions in solids feature numerous 4f- intra-shell transitions that are effectively shielded from their crystalline surroundings by closed outer shells, allowing for long spin coherence times (up to 6 hours in Eu:Y2SiO5) and narrow optical transitions (<100 Hz in Er:Y2SiO5). Yet, the lack of a wafer-scale synthesis technique for such high-performance qubits severely limits their prospects as a functional building block of quantum information processing. Here we propose a new technology of solid-state qubits based on rare-earth ions doped in epitaxial oxide thin films on silicon wafers. The thin film host matrix is synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy, offering the highest possible crystalline quality and ensuring consistent, long coherences of qubits throughout the wafer. This wafer architecture with embedded qubits can be processed with standard fabrication techniques into scalable quantum electronic and photonic devices.<br/><br/>Beyond quantum science and engineering, this project will generate substantial knowledge and technical advancements to push the limits of wafer manufacturing and optoelectronic technologies by enabling a new class of thin film based electrical and optical devices including lasers, modulators, switches, and transducers. These technologies are poised to revolutionize the existing fields of communications, computing and sensing. The complex and highly interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide a unique opportunity for training graduate students and postdocs as new generation quantum scientists and engineers. The project will also highlight outreach efforts to engage undergraduate, women, and underrepresented minority students via sponsored summer research programs at the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>Part 2:<br/>Qubits based on rare-earth ions possess long spin coherences and optical transitions in the telecom wavelength (erbium in particular), making them ideally suited for long-distance quantum network with existing fiber-optic telecommunication infrastructure. So far, the exceptional coherence of rare-earth ions has been routinely measured when they are doped in macroscopic bulk oxide crystals (e.g. Y2O3, Y2SiO5). These bulk materials, while having superior structural and optical quality, do not allow standard wafer processing to fabricate large-scale quantum devices as desired by state-of-the-art quantum technologies. In this EAGER proposal, we explore a new approach to epitaxially grow rare-earth qubits in oxide thin films as host matrix on industry-standard silicon wafers using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This concept is entirely new and exploratory given that there is little prior knowledge on the wafer-scale qubit manufacturing technique for long-lived rare-earth ions, which makes this research particularly fit for the NSF EAGER program. While the inherent risk is significant, the potential impact of this technology can be paradigm-shifting in the following aspects: 1) it vastly increases the packing factor of qubits (atomic length-scale) compared to the current superconducting circuit technology (micron scale). 2) high structural and optical quality of the epitaxial film enhances the rare-earth qubit coherence to ~1 second compared to ~100 microsecond in leading superconducting qubits; 3) qubits on silicon wafers enable seamless integration with silicon-based quantum electronics and photonics technology; 4) thin film topology enables large-scale top-down device fabrication using standard lithography and etching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The realization of short-wavelength VCSELs with stable and predictable light polarization will enable unique applications in high-density optical data storage, high-resolution printing, lighting, displays, projectors, miniature atomic clocks, and chemical/biological sensing that are not easily accomplished with conventional edge-emitting lasers. To address a variety of polarization-sensitive applications that require higher-power light emitters, the devices will be formed into polarization-pinned arrays. The educational and outreach components are aimed at promoting interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and developing scientific literacy at the undergraduate and K-12 levels. These activities are focused on working with underrepresented students, including Native Americans, Hispanics, and women. Specific educational objectives are to collaborate with the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute on an education and outreach program, continue mentoring activities for underrepresented populations and local K-12 teachers, and develop a combined undergraduate/graduate course in fabrication techniques for optoelectronic devices. <br/><br/>The unique material properties of nonpolar and semipolar orientations of Gallium nitride (GaN) will be combined with a novel flip-chip fabrication scheme to enable the first polarization-pinned GaN-based VCSEL arrays and the first semipolar GaN-based green VCSELs. The novel fabrication scheme utilizes band-gap-selective photoelectrochemical etching to remove the growth substrate, enable high-reflectance dielectric distributed Bragg reflector mirrors, and provide fine control of the cavity length. The nonpolar and semipolar GaN platform exhibits large and highly anisotropic optical gain, which provides a simple method to achieve polarization pinning in short wavelength GaN-based VCSELs. When combined, these approaches enable blue and green VCSEL arrays that are applicable to polarization-sensitive optical systems and provide orders-of-magnitude higher output powers than single VCSELs. An output power of 50 mW from a 10x10 element nonpolar blue VCSEL array is set as an initial target. The thorough study of nonpolar and semipolar VCSELs will generate new fundamental knowledge about the correlations between polarization-pinning with band structure, higher-order modes, gain-cavity resonance offset, and operating conditions. The polarization, spectral purity, and noise properties of individual devices as well as arrays will be investigated with confocal microscopy and correlated to the material and device properties. Finally, the first investigation of band-gap-selective photoelectrochemical etching on semipolar GaN may reveal new fundamental materials phenomena and be applicable to other semipolar light-emitting devices."

Many of the existing and proposed devices rely on spin torques which are used to control magnetization dynamics and to manipulate magnetic states of nanoscale devices. The prominent examples are magnetic switching and spin torque oscillators. Spin torque oscillators can be used to create local microwave fields assisting the magnetic writing in hard drives. Furthermore, they can transmit information by emitting spin waves into a magnonic waveguide. Such oscillators exhibit a rich palette of nonlinear phenomena that makes them particularly attractive device candidates within the emerging paradigm of neuromorphic computing. The central prerequisite for the design and realization of spin torque devices is the energy-efficient generation of customized spin torques. Spin torques are exerted by spin currents injected into a magnetic device element. Currently, the major bottlenecks for the development of next generation devices are limitations to the polarization direction of pure spin currents and ohmic heating. The proposed research addresses these challenges, aiming to advance existing and to spark novel device concepts. The objective is to overcome the polarization constraints for pure spin currents and to utilize thermal effects for the generation of customizable spin torques.  In the course of this research, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art experimental skills of device fabrications, material characterization, and magnetic spectroscopy. The proposal contains an outreach component that targets local school teachers who will receive training in electromagnetism and spintronics concepts. Moreover, an outreach program for a local science and arts event will be developed and presented to the students.<br/><br/>The proposed approach utilizes spin-orbit torques in metallic ferromagnets (such as anomalous Hall effect and planar Hall effect) and furthermore investigates thermal spin injection via spin Seebeck effect in coupled two-ferromagnet systems. It is planned to fabricate nanowire devices from bilayers consisting of an insulating ferrimagnet and a metallic ferromagnet, where the latter serves as spin injector. Spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements will be carried out to assess spin dynamics in these coupled spin systems and to investigate the spin torques due to the spin-orbit and thermal effects. Furthermore, spin injectors with perpendicular and oblique spin polarizations will be engineered and implemented in novel spin-electronic applications, such as perpendicular spin torque oscillators, spin superfluid conveyors, and antiferromagnetic planar switches.

Such a device promises to enable the solution of large-scale problems that cannot be addressed using other techniques. Applications include factoring large numbers (useful for cryptography), searching large databases, and simulating physical systems at the quantum mechanical level (e.g., for drug design). A quantum computer exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to perform calculations. Its fundamental building block is the qubit, or quantum bit. The power in a quantum computer lies in its ability to operate in a parallel manner; with every additional qubit added, the computational power doubles.  Because of this property, a quantum computer with just 300 ideal qubits could manipulate a data set that has more elements than there are electrons in the universe! However, the best available qubits are currently far from ideal and projections indicate that a quantum processor built with these imperfect devices will require millions of qubits to achieve the level of performance described above. One of the major challenges associated with scaling contemporary systems to this level lies in the complexity associated with the interface between the quantum processor and a standard computer. The central goal of this project is to explore the use of silicon integrated circuit technology to redesign this interface in such a way that it is amenable to scaling. The ability to scale the number of qubits from 100 qubits to millions of qubits is expected to make a significant impact in science and engineering. In addition to the technical goals of this project, a number of educational goals are being pursued. These items include curriculum development, undergraduate and graduate student research opportunities, trips to scientific research centers, and outreach to K-12 educators.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the control and readout of superconducting transmon qubits. Such superconducting artificial atoms are a particularly attractive choice for use in a large-scale quantum computer due to the fact that they can be engineered at the circuit level and constructed using the standard lithographic techniques. However, it is necessary to protect these devices from environmental noise by cooling them below 0.05 Kelvin. Today, control and readout is carried out using racks of room temperature equipment, connected to the quantum processor through bulky coaxial cables. To enable scaling from systems with less than 100 qubits to the million-qubit level, the classical/quantum interface must be integrated in the refrigerator and in close proximity to the quantum processor. To prevent heating of the cryogenic system, the power consumption of the control and readout electronics must be pushed towards the fundamental limits. The objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of a prototype quantum control and measurement system that is of low enough energy consumption that it may be placed near the quantum processor. The project consists of three inter-related efforts. First, waveform generators appropriate for controlling transmon qubits will be investigated. These devices will be optimized for energy consumption and gate fidelity. Second, an integrated circuit receiver appropriate for qubit readout will be developed. Both the readout and control circuits will be implemented in SiGe BiCMOS technology, owing to its cryogenic low noise and low power capabilities. Finally, these two devices will be tested with qubits and the gate/readout fidelity will be reported. Integrated cryogenic electronics are believed to be essential to enable the manipulation and readout of future fault-tolerant quantum processors; as such, the development of this new technology is expected to greatly advance the field of quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, discovering methods that improve the performance of electronic systems will directly lead to improvements in quality of life. Moreover, improving the energy efficiency of electronics directly impacts society as it reduces the carbon footprint of modern data centers and increases the lifetime of ubiquitous mobile devices. This project aims to improve both the performance and energy efficiency of electronic systems by exploring a new electronic integration concept based on heterogeneous interconnect stitching. The principle innovation in the proposed integration approach is the use of stitch chips on the surface of a package to form dense and low-energy interconnects between the assembled dice. The assembled chips, moreover, are interconnected using multi-height and multi-pitch compressible micro-interconnects, which are high density mechanically flexible interconnects that enable robust interconnection between all chips. To accomplish our objectives, the following fundamental research topics are investigated: 1) analysis of the power supply noise in multi-die assemblies using interconnect stitching; 2) experimentally demonstrating the assembly of a 2x2 array of chips using interconnect stitching; and 3) extracting the frequency-dependent parasitics of the compressible micro-interconnects up to 50 GHz. All research will be performed at Georgia Tech, which is one of the nodes within the NSF supported National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure program. This enables us to easily expose K-12 students to this research and encourage them to pursue science and engineering education. The proposed research will also involve the graduate and undergraduate students conducting the research with multiple disciplines that include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering. Such research experience will enhance their education and better prepares students to work in industry because they would already have a fundamental understanding of how different disciplines interact with each other in electronic systems.<br/><br/>The performance and power dissipation of electronic computing systems have become increasingly dominated by interconnections. The proposed Heterogeneous Interconnect Stitching Technology (HIST) can greatly reduce interconnect length between components; thereby offering higher bandwidth density at reduced energy per bit. Moreover, the proposed research will enable the integration of active devices (photonic, logic, memory, etc.) in very close proximity (i.e., face-to-face bonding); thereby greatly reducing electrical parasitics and improving interconnect densities. But, the proposed integration approach may exacerbate the challenges in power delivery due to increased power density of the assembled package. As a result, the intellectual merit of the proposed research is twofold. First, the proposed research will develop fundamental understanding of the power delivery network design in the proposed heterogeneous integration approach to minimize parasitics-induced voltage drops and switching noise as a function of several technology parameters. Second, the proposed research will experimentally demonstrate the key interconnect and assembly technologies that will enable low-power and high-performance computing systems. The experimental effort will specifically focus on developing a 2x2 array of dice interconnected using stitch chips and the characterization of the HIST interconnect channels up to 50 GHz. The experimental research will also explore robust and high-yield batch-scale fabrication of multi-height and multi-pitch compressible micro-interconnects as well as their mechanical reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A person with lower-limb amputation relies heavily on a leg prosthesis to support himself/herself and stay mobile.  However, most leg prostheses in current use are unpowered, which can cause great inconvenience.  For example, these unpowered prostheses cannot propel the amputee users forward in walking, and cannot push them up while standing up or climbing stairs.  With the advances in medical robotic technologies, powered robotic leg prostheses are starting to become more common.  These powered prostheses can help amputees to walk more easily and naturally, and also provide power to support activities previously unattainable or extremely difficult with existing unpowered prostheses (such as standing up and stair climbing).  On the other hand, these robotic prostheses are much more complex than the existing unpowered prostheses, so tuning such a prosthesis to fit an individual user is very challenging and time-consuming, requiring numerous office visits with a clinician over a long period of time.  This is one of the main reasons why powered leg prostheses have not gained extensive use among the amputee users.<br/><br/>In this project, the research team will help to solve this problem by developing a new method to automate the prosthesis tuning process.  The main idea is to use a pendant-like wearable sensor to measure upper body motion, which provides rich information about how well the prosthesis is being controlled to help the user to walk and perform other basic tasks of daily life.  The new method will use such information and gradually tune the controller parameters over time without the need for constant clinical supervision.  To develop this method, the researchers will study how an experienced prosthetist tunes the prosthesis parameters and develop an algorithm to mimic this process.  Furthermore, the upper body motion will be used to infer the amputee user's intention more precisely, so the prosthesis can reliably understand what the user intends to do even if he/she changes the motion pattern while learning to use the robotic prosthesis.<br/><br/>By conducting research in this project, the researchers aim to develop a complete Personalized Prosthesis Controller Adaptation (PPCA) system, which provides personalized controller adaption on two levels: 1) automatic motion controller tuning, and 2) automatic intent recognizer adaptation.  The researchers anticipate to make significant contributions to the related scientific areas, including: 1) a novel wearable sensor that incorporates an inertial measurement unit (IMU), capacitive sensing (for sensor-torso relative motion), and advanced signal processing to provide reliable trunk motion information; 2) fundamental understanding of robotic prosthesis-assisted amputee locomotion, and how human expertise-based tuning optimizes its gait quality; 3) a novel quasi-supervised adaptation of classifier-based intent recognizer, which provides the advantages of the traditional supervised learning while avoiding its major weakness (highly effective in adapting to changing human conditions, and no repeated training sessions or human-conducted data labeling required).  Impacts of this project will also be generated by its various education activities, including the introduction of robotic technologies to the future prosthetic clinicians through a renowned prosthetics and orthotics education program, and the creation of hands-on robotic projects in undergraduate research, which can also serve as important tools in the K-12 outreach to attract children at different age groups to the science and engineering fields."

It has enabled electronic data (0s and 1s) to be directly written onto light pulses that travel the globe and essentially form the backbone of the internet. It is also used to change the color of light emitted by lasers, of importance for high-speed computing and sensing, as well as to enable realization of novel quantum sources of light that may enable next-generation ultra-secure optical communications. However, currently the performance of lithium-niobate based optical devices is limited by their bulky size. This project aims to miniaturize these to the nanoscale by patterning lithium-niobate onto a photonic microchip, thereby enhancing their efficiency many-fold. This will enable the design of novel light sources with greatly improved properties compared to current technology and also significantly reduce the optical power requirements. The proposed research program is a natural template for informing students, teachers, and the public of how scientists and engineers explore the unique behavior of materials at the nanoscale, and make use of these properties in the creation of new devices. The team will leverage the ""magic"" of optics and lasers to engage a wide audience and inform the public of their ongoing research. The program has strong theoretical and experimental components and addresses both fundamental and engineering aspects of light-generation in nanoscale optical devices and systems. Therefore, it represents a unique research and educational opportunity for students at all levels. The devices and systems that will be developed will be of great interest to both the scientific community and commercial industry.<br/>Abstract (technical): Lithium-niobate, with its large second-order susceptibility, relatively large refractive index and wide transmission window extending from ultra-violet to mid-infrared, is one of the most important optoelectronic materials, widely used for electro-optic modulation and classical & quantum optical frequency conversion. However, due to difficulties associated with fabrication, most of these components are discrete and cannot be easily integrated onto a photonic microchip. Fortunately, recent advances in lithium-niobate thin-film fabrication techniques, via crystal ion slicing, are promising and enable chip-scale integration of nanophotonic devices. The proposed program builds on these results and seeks to develop an integrated nonlinear nanophotonics platform that combines the unique material properties of periodically-poled lithium-niobate with the superior light confinement and dispersion engineering in wavelength-scale optical waveguides and cavities. The new platform will be developed based on thin x-cut lithium-niobate device layers (~500-nm thick) bonded on top of a SiO2 substrate that provides optical isolation. The team will develop new techniques for surface poling of thin x-cut lithium-niobate films, thus allowing for efficient phase matching. State of the art nanofabrication techniques will be used to realize optical waveguides and cavities directly in the periodically-poled device layer. The devices will operate over a wide wavelength range (visible to mid-infrared) and enable strong photon interactions resulting in 40-fold more efficient nonlinear processes than those found in conventional counterparts. The program is expected to result in a wide variety of integrated devices and systems with applications in quantum frequency conversion, entangled-photon pair generation, supercontinuum generation, and frequency comb generation. The proposed program is transformative since it introduces lithium-niobate into the family of materials suitable for integrated, on-chip photonics. It will result in the development of a wide range of novel & more efficient nonlinear optical devices & systems, and make an impact on disciplines as diverse as quantum information science & technology, remote sensing, astronomy and optoelectronics."

These estimators should be robust to gross errors on the measurements and the model parameter values while providing good state estimates even in the presence of large dynamical system model uncertainties and non-Gaussian thick-tailed process and observation noises. It turns out that the current Kalman filter-based dynamic state estimators given in the literature suffer from several important shortcomings, precluding them from being adopted by power utilities for practical applications. To be specific, they cannot handle (i) dynamic model uncertainty and parameter errors; (ii) non-Gaussian process and observation noise of the system nonlinear dynamic models; (iii) any type of outliers that are induced by impulsive measurement and system process noises, or incorrect system parameter values, to cite a few; and (iv) all types of cyber attacks. To address these challenges, this project will resort to both robust statistical theory and robust control theory to develop a general theoretical framework for robust dynamic state and parameter estimation. This new general framework will provide reliable real-time state and parameter estimates for power system monitoring, control, protection, and security analysis. In addition, it will contribute to the next generation of online state estimators with synchrophasor measurements and the redesign of robust detectors against cyber attacks. The project also contains an integrated educational agenda for K-12 students, undergraduates and graduate students who are interested in the STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) area.<br/><br/>This project will pioneer a general theoretical framework that integrates both robust statistical theory and robust control theory for robust dynamic state and parameter estimation of a cyber-physical system. Specifically, the generalized maximum-likelihood-type (GM)-estimator, the unscented Kalman filter, and the H-infinity filter will be integrated into a unified framework to yield various centralized and decentralized robust dynamic state estimators. These new estimators will be able to handle large system uncertainties as well as suppress three types of outliers while achieving good statistical efficiency under a broad range of non-Gaussian process and observation noise. The three types of outliers, including observation, innovation, and structural outliers are caused by either an unreliable dynamical model or real-time synchrophasor measurements with data quality issues, which are commonly seen in the power system. Furthermore, the theories of robust statistics will be extended to structured nonlinear regression models. That is, the theory of breakdown point in linear structured regression will be extended to nonlinear dynamical models characterized by sparse Jacobian matrices, which is precisely the case for power systems. To this end, the global and local breakdown points of all the proposed methods will be investigated. Finally, the developed methods will be implemented and tested on two practical power systems, including the Southern Brazil power system and the Dominion Virginia Power 500-KV transmission system, which is observed through a set of redundant real-time synchrophasor measurements."

If successful, the research will have tremendous impact on molecular electronics community and many other areas, such as energy research and molecular force spectroscopy. The education and outreach objective of this proposal is to tightly integrate the research efforts and results with graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 education and to globally disseminate both research and the education outcomes.<br/>Technical:<br/>Although the electrical conductance and mechanical properties of single-molecule junctions have achieved significant progress over the past decade, challenges of a detailed understanding of molecular binding structures and electron transport, and the structure-force-conductance correlations, are still unresolved. This research will develop a combined molecular simulation and scanning probe microscope break-junction technique to probe and control the structure and dynamics in molecular electronics devices: (1) Performing molecular simulations by using as close as possible the experimental parameters, dynamics of electrode and realistic atomic interactions to understand the binding structure and force measurement in scanning probe experiment; (2) Developing a dual-mode feedback system with AC-coupled high speed amplifier at radio frequency to capture the key transitions of molecular binding sites that induce conductance changes. The experimental data at nanosecond (ns) timescale will be directly compared with molecular simulation results; (3) Using the coordinated molecular simulation and scanning probe break-junction experiment to probe the structure and dynamics of selected benchmark systems under different mode trainings. Multi-variable force-conductance two-dimensional cross-correlation histogram analyses for the force and conductance traces will be performed in experiments and simulations, and the distinct stable configurations of molecular junctions will be identified. The coordinated computational and experimental research project will also provide an interdisciplinary research for students in materials, mechanics, chemistry, electronics, and computational materials science."

Agricultural runoff from over-fertilization and waste from large farms into natural water sources can cause algae outbreaks, reduce the dissolved oxygen in water, resulting in ecosystem disturbance and decline in fish populations. Precision agriculture with data-backed decision-making such as fine-grained spatiotemporal soil properties (moisture, temperature, pH, nutrients, organic matter, etc.) has potential to improve the efficiency of the farming practices by increasing crop growth and reducing agricultural runoff that contaminates surface and groundwater along with other negative environmental impacts. Current practice of soil property measurement relies heavily on taking samples for laboratory testing, which is costly and time consuming for implementation over large areas. This project will investigate a low-cost autonomous soil nutrient sensing system to support precision agriculture by integrating microelectromechanical system sensors, ground penetrating radar, as well as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled wireless sensor network.<br/><br/>The project includes the development of a passive, low cost, pervasive, maintenance-free sensor that can be interrogated wirelessly and provide measurement of soil water content, temperature, pH, and nutrient concentration. The project focuses on detecting and evaluating nitrate and heavy metal ions concentration in the soil, which are indicators of agricultural runoffs and environmental contaminants. For this purpose, surface acoustic wave sensors that consist of surface acoustic wave delay lines and conductive polymer-based impedance sensors connected to a reflector will be considered as the main sensing modules. The sensors can be placed in the soil for in-situ measurement. The specific research objectives of this project are to: 1) identify specific polymers for nitrate and heavy metal ion detection, 2) design, fabricate and validate the surface acoustic wave sensors, 3) design and select proper antenna and ground penetrating radar for wireless measurement of the passive sensors, and 4) integrate the data analysis and communication system. The project team has a collective research expertise in biochemistry, radar and antenna design, microelectromechanical sensors, and communication networks in the field of electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering as well as life sciences. The success of this project can lead to significant improvement in the autonomous devices with novel antenna, communication system and nutrient sensor designs to measure signals in the soil at a reasonable cost and are scalable for deployment on a larger scale. The resulting integration of knowledge and expertise from multiple domains, and the generation of new methodologies and data, will provide the means to address pressing societal challenges in sustainable agriculture from a holistic design point of view. The project has potential to forge important new directions for several scholarly and professional disciplines that are oriented toward improving community resilience and train a cohort of undergraduate and graduate students from multiple disciplines to engage in scientific research and create usable scientific tools for stakeholders for a sustainable future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

No current camera technology can operate at these extremely high frame rates and video durations for the observation of isolated events. The primary challenges for such a technology are the short time-gating and high light irradiance necessary to achieve fast exposure times with extremely high frame rate and the massive information bandwidth associated with such high-speed image acquisition. Such a high-speed single-shot imaging system is an enabling technology for numerous applications throughout engineering and the physical and life sciences. In particular, we plan to leverage the ultrafast single-shot imager developed through this program to better understand the dynamics of materials under extreme conditions. This research can positively impact society from a health and safety perspective through better understanding of the effect of impacts on materials and thus facilitate the development of materials that can better control and prevent injuries to the human body. In addition, through this research program we plan to offer undergraduate research experiences, provide the project data and experimental system for educational purposes such as class design projects and hands-on lab demonstrations, and further our participation in outreach activities for young students from severely underrepresented groups within the engineering discipline. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this research program is to develop and experimentally validate a photonic imaging system employing compressed sensing (CS) for video acquisition at frame rates well beyond a terahertz (THz). Our approach leverages the dimensionality reduction afforded by CS to reconstruct three-dimensional spatio-temporal video information from a single high resolution two-dimensional image captured by a camera. Thereby, the measurement efficiency of CS will also mitigate the traditional challenge of the acquisition of a large amount of image data in an extremely short amount of time. Furthermore, our approach is built upon a temporal Fourier processor using a time-lens to imprint the temporal scene dynamics onto an ultrafast laser pulse's spectrum allowing for capture of three-dimensional spatio-temporal video information using a hyperspectral CS camera architecture. This time-lens approach fully leverages the available optical bandwidth maximizing both the frame rate and the number of frames captured in a single exposure. We aim to reach frame rates beyond 1 THz and record lengths of more than 100 frames. No current technology can achieve this combination of performance, yet such a technology can be revolutionary for understanding of ultrafast physical phenomena. Specifically, such single-shot imaging is necessary for observing isolated events such as destructive, rare, and/or costly events and is extremely challenging on ultrafast time-scales. Through this research program we will develop this imager, investigate methods for increasing image contrast, and begin to explore its application to the understanding of material failure under extreme conditions."

While the project's goal is to develop methodologies that can find application on a wide range of control systems, the control of small autonomous networked mobile agents will be used to focus the research and to validate the technologies developed. The interest in mobile agents for civilian applications is at an all-time high, motivated by a large number of applications, including mapping and surveying, infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, agricultural monitoring, precision agriculture, livestock management, among many others. In fact, it was foreseen that the legalization of commercial drones will create an economic impact of $82 billion until 2025 and that agriculture would provide the most substantial portion of that growth. This proposal is focused on autonomous and networked mobile agents, as autonomy and network connectivity allow groups of agents to carry out tasks faster and more reliably. The proposed activities will have a strong educational component aimed at motivating students to pursue advanced degrees in the sciences and engineering, through a combination of activities aimed attracting high-school students to the STEM disciplines through a Summer Internship program, exposing undergraduate students to research, and expanding the opportunities for mentoring and professional development for graduate students.<br/><br/>The wide range of small, low-power, low-cost microprocessors, solid-sate sensors, and communication devices point to control architectures in which feedback loops are composed of multiple units connected through shared communication networks. These units will include controllers, sensors, and actuators, each endowed with the ability to perform some level of local computation. The use of shared networks results in architectures that are extremely flexible, easy to deploy, and highly reconfigurable, but also introduce additional challenges because the traditional unity feedback loop that operates in continuous time or at a fixed sampling rate is not adequate when sensor data arrives from multiple sources, asynchronously, delayed, and possibly corrupted. However, this challenge is mitigated by the availability of significant computational power at each node, enabling novel forms of control design. An attractive alternative to traditional forms of feedback control design relies in the use of online optimization algorithms that search directly for control actions and directly incorporate in this search all (or most of) the desired design constraints, including those constraints related to performance and robustness with respect to faults. Until a few years ago, the use of online optimization was mostly restricted to the control of slow processes, such as in chemical process control, supply chain management, or enterprise control, because of the long times required by the optimization engines. Nevertheless, when sampling was sufficiently slow, techniques like Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) enjoyed an impressive success and became the de-facto standard in many domains. The technological advances in microprocessors, solid-sate sensors, and communication devices mentioned above have the potential to enable online-optimization to reach a wide range of applications with fast sampling times and limited energy budgets, including the control of small autonomous networked mobile agents. The research proposed will make significant contributions towards the development of principled approaches for control based on the integration of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to achieve in stable and high performance feedback control systems."

The expected data rate to satisfy the needs of the customers is projected to be 100 Gbit/s by 2020. However, the speed of today's wireless communication systems is limited by the narrow bandwidth of existing transmitters and receivers and the heavy use of the electromagnetic spectrum up to 60 GHz. This trend has been forcing researchers to push the carrier frequencies of transceivers to higher frequencies to allow operation at frequency bands which have not been allocated to any specific active service yet. In order to increase the channel capacity, researchers have been trying to operate at terahertz frequencies, which cover the frequency range of 0.3-10 THz in the electromagnetic spectrum. While communication systems with such high carrier frequencies have been hard to develop so far, a data link operating at terahertz frequencies with data rates exceeding 100 Gbit/s over 10-20 meters distance is believed to be viable now thanks to recent advancements in terahertz photonics and electronics. The research component of this program plans to develop such a high data rate wireless communication system at terahertz carrier frequencies for indoor communication applications. A system with this capability can be very suitable for the next generation indoor wireless communication systems such as wireless local area networks and wireless personal area networks, kiosk downloads, wireless backhauling, data center connection, and real-time data analysis for wearable devices. Additionally, this program plans to integrate research with education and outreach activities by developing new courses, recruitment and involvement of undergraduate students, and organizing high-school seminars. <br/><br/>During this program a directional terahertz transceiver system based on an adaptive two-dimensional array of plasmonic photomixers operating under novel communication protocols is designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated. The proposed work presents an entirely new perspective on the potential use of terahertz bandwidth for increasing wireless communication data rates to levels that could not be envisioned before due to low output power and limited adaptability of existing terahertz transmitters. This limitation can be tackled through use of plasmonic photomixer arrays that offer significantly higher terahertz radiation powers and higher level of transmitter adaptability compared to other terahertz transmitter candidates. Additionally, the adaptive nature of the proposed terahertz transceiver system allows compensation for accidental misalignments and shadowing effects through beam-forming and non-line-of-sight communication links. While theoretical investigations provide a deep understanding of fundamental physical limitations of terahertz transceiver systems based on plasmonic photomixer arrays and achievable wireless communication data rates, the experimental effort provides valuable data to develop accurate channel models at terahertz frequencies in order to utilize appropriate communication modalities, equalization techniques, and adaptive signal tracking systems to mitigate signal fading in indoor terahertz communication systems."

The applications resulting from these possibilities require increasingly broader bandwidth. This ever-increasing need for broader bandwidth over a very crowded spectrum below 30 gigahertz (GHz) necessitates new paradigm shifts to enable spectrally efficient communications. Improving spectral efficiency by only increasing the complexity of modulation schemes to 256-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) or higher is expected to plateau, as it exerts stringent design requirements that are impossible to achieve given the power budget constraint in a wireless system. On the other hand, the vastly under-utilized spectrum across the terahertz (THz) band, commonly referred to the frequency band from 300 GHz to 3 THz, has prompted researchers to investigate futuristic wireless systems that can potentially achieve 10+ gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates, normally only achievable in wired (copper or optical) links. The availability of wide spectrum over the THz band also addresses a challenging requirement associated with conventional wireless links, that is, the need to accommodate very complex modulation schemes to enhance spectral efficiency so as to best take advantage of an already congested band at lower radio frequencies (i.e., 30 GHz and below). <br/><br/>The main objective of this interdisciplinary research project is to study, design, and implement novel integrated phased-array wireless transmitter architectures that are amenable to frequency scaling and will be the core enabling blocks for a wireless infrastructure that can potentially achieve 50 Gbps line-of-sight (LOS) wireless connectivity over a 20-50m link range. The project will leverage prior experience and knowledge established in the PIs' research groups in the areas of silicon-based THz integrated circuits design as well as multi-antenna wireless communication theory.  This proposal will develop new phased-array transmitter architectures that overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we propose a phase locked loop based phased-array with no need of local oscillators or radio-frequency phase shifters and front-end power amplifiers. Importantly, we exploit the non-linearity of front-end frequency triplers to combine three streams of lower bandwidth intermediate-frequency data right before the high data rate signal is radiated by the antennas. We propose to study analog beamforming and hybrid analog/digital beamforming methods that are fine-tuned to specific phased-array structures proposed in this project so as to provide efficient adaptive beam-steering. This clearly requires a close collaboration between circuits and communications experts to address many challenges. As proof of concept, we will design and implement a 300-GHz, 16-element phased-array transmitter. Upon successful fabrication and temporal/spectral measurements, we will expand our current indoor wireless testing setup and conduct outdoor wireless testing."

To exploit these data efficiently for elevating application-specific objectives, built-in intelligences are warranted in these sensor platforms to endow transitions from the traditional rule-based computing paradigm to emerging data-driven computing methods. Deep learning on multi-layered networks of neurons has provided such an opportunity to achieve intelligent computing through learning from the abundant data collected by sensing devices. How to make the current energy-intensive deep learning that mainly runs on clusters of general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) amenable to various low-power systems remains to be a formidable challenge. This project envisages inventing hardware-friendly learning techniques and designing customized low-power deep learning hardware capable of real-time in-situ learning. The innovative hardware will be implemented on various low-power platforms to significantly accelerate the deployment of the nascent Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology. The low-power deep learning chip will enable energy-constraint systems to sense, process, organize, and utilize the data more intelligently. Useful information associated with the collected data can be extracted and exploited at the front end, thereby reducing the system response time and the energy consumption in wireless communications.<br/><br/>In this research project, energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) will be used to construct deep learning networks. By leveraging the sparsity in multi-dimensional input data such as image, audio and video, the use of event-triggered SNNs can potentially result in significant energy savings. Building deep neural networks in SNNs also has the advantage of good scalability as CMOS technology advances beyond 10 nm. Through address-event representation, hundreds of sub-SNNs can be interconnected to build large SNNs solving disparate types of large-scale problems. Underlying difficulties owing to lack of effective learning algorithms in SNNs will be addressed by formulating the modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rules. Through these bio-inspired on-line new learning rules, hardware-based SNNs can be designed for the event-triggered computation and deep learning. The neural hardware will be at first prototyped and validated on commercial FPGA boards, before realizing digitally by using nano-scale CMOS technology. Finally, in order to further reduce energy dissipation as warranted in ultra-low-power wearable systems, emergent memristor, i.e., analog resistive memory technology will be co-integrated into CMOS chip to mimic high-density artificial synapses. Variation-resilient architectures and algorithms will be developed to fully exploit the density of the memristor arrays, while tolerating their concomitant conductance variations due to several manufacturing limitations. Further, the integration of research and education will train future engineering workforce encompassing minority and female. Instructive materials developed under this project will be disseminated to research communities and practicing engineers by leveraging the NSF supported nanoHub repository."

The strategies and decisions of data center DR will be made based on the workload management algorithms that balance quality of service and energy efficiency and determine the supply functions. The workload management algorithms will optimize quality of service under the electric load constraints imposed by DR accordingly. This project will make three unique contributions: (1) new market programs with strategic participation of data centers in DR, instead of passive price takers, (2) fundamental understanding of the impacts of power network constraints on data center DR and new distributed algorithms for solving optimal power flow with stochastic renewable supplies, and (3) high-performance dynamic server provisioning and load balancing algorithms for large scale data centers under time-varying and stochastic electric load constraints and on-site renewable generation."

Photonics uses light instead of electronics to perform a variety of functions such as information processing and transfer. While most of us still work in offices and meet friends in person, mobile and networking device capability has enabled massive online business and social transaction growth. The Internet and its cloud-based services are used for production systems, banking, entertainment, social interaction, information distribution and research. Resulting information accumulation is fueling the rise of ""big data,"" as well as the powerful correlation tools that help analysts spot financial trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and improve quality of research. More and more, we put content in the cloud for easy access from anywhere and at any time, with data growing exponentially. All this data transfer uses a surprising amount of energy. To reduce data center energy consumption while increasing data capacity by over ten fold, this research will investigate novel hybrid data communication interfaces, using light rather than electrons to process and transfer data at higher speeds. The potentially explosive increase in data rates enabled by these hybrid photonic interconnects could lead to several transformative applications, such as future exascale data centers, terabit speed local area networks, and massively-parallel computing for big data applications. These hybrid photonic interconnects will not only have a broad impact on the semiconductor industry, but also US energy sustainability and security, as more energy-efficient computing systems would reduce carbon footprint of the Internet cloud. Further, to prepare students for the workforce with the necessary skills to drive future technology, the project includes a strong educational component. Interactive learning methods will be employed to teach electronic circuits and to bring photonics to integrated circuit design. The project also incorporates a high school outreach program, with an annual Smart Environments for Sustainability-themed one-week summer camp for high school students that commits to fostering women and minority group representation in integrated circuit design.<br/><br/>Technology development leveraging integrated photonic circuits and optical interconnects has thus far largely focused on binary communication using silicon photonic modulators. To enable future optical interconnects for higher data rates and energy-efficiency, researchers must reconsider the hybrid integrated circuit paradigm. An important technology enabler is the high-speed signal processing capability of integrated photonic devices. The research approach will first be to develop a photonic design kit with standard cell libraries and compact models to enable large scale integration of photonic devices into hybrid integrated circuits. Researchers will employ photonic device high-speed optical domain signal processing into novel circuit configurations, exploit synergistic interaction between electronic and photonic components, and form a mixed-signal photonic architecture. Next, to exploit photonics beyond binary interconnects; researchers will develop novel mixed-signal photonic data converters, which they will use to demonstrate an advanced modulation transceiver architecture that is scalable to terabits per second data rates with order-of-magnitude lower energy consumption. Research outcomes will empower integrated circuit researchers by equipping them with a new photonics expertise to tackle nano-scaled technology design challenges, where data transfer bottlenecks constrain system performance. The photonic design kit will lower industry barriers to help facilitate photonics adoption into integrated circuits; resulting mixed-signal photonic data converter architectures will set a new paradigm by achieving greater than 10 GHz sampling rates with significantly reduced energy consumption over existing complementary metal?oxide?semiconductor (CMOS)-only architectures. Researchers will broadly disseminate project results by developing online educational material for a new CMOS photonics integrated circuit design graduate course, and through international journals and conferences."

Because of the limited transparency, most computed predictions are not easily justifiable by humans who need to render final decisions. This project addresses this shortcoming of machine learning predictions by investigating a class of machine learning algorithms that mimics natural processing and leads to more interpretable representations of data. Such processing decomposes visual patterns or other data into parts through unsupervised learning and produces non-negative parts only.  Since this approach allows only additive recombination of parts to reconstruct the original data, it mimics natural processing in human perception and cognition. The project advances novel data representation beyond standard computational learning approaches.  Tests are conducted with planar images or tabulated data that describe specific domain of interest. The tests objectives are to produce useful and understandable features, logic rules or verbal explanations in lower dimensional space. <br/><br/>This work aims at evaluating how rich data can be explored in order to be better understood. The novel paradigm is to generate non-negative, sparse and localized features and receptive fields within hierarchies of features. This is achieved through autoencoder-based transformations of visual images or of typical non-negative data matrices.  The novel autoencoders are constrained to have non-negative weights. Specific conditions to be tested include pooling, rectifying-type activation functions of neurons and select norms of activations sparsity. The project advances the following transformational challenges at the intersection of computational and human systems: (1) Representation of data with non-negative encodings only, (2)  Complexity of layers and of receptive filters (more simpler filters vs. fewer complex filters), (3) Choice of the number of layers, also in the context of hyper-parameter tuning, (4) Pooling for non-negative processing,  (5) Connections between the autoencoder-based learning and related biological evidence, and finally (6) Ability to generate explanations or understandable rules for select domains"

Expert analyses show that in 2011, the amount of generated data surpassed 1.8 zeta bytes and will increase by a factor of 50 until 2020. To overcome these challenges, both the semiconductor industry and the research community are exploring new avenues in computing. Two of the promising approaches are acceleration and approximation. Among accelerators, Graphic Processing Units provide significant compute capabilities. Graphic Processing Units, originally designed to accelerate graphics functions, now are processing large amounts of real-world data that are collected from sensors, radar, environment, financial markets, and medical devices. As Graphic Processing Units play a major role in accelerating many classes of applications, improving their performance and energy efficiency has become imperative. This project leverages the fact that many applications that benefit from Graphic Processing Units are amenable to imprecise computation. This characteristic provides an opportunity to devise approximation techniques that trade small losses in the output quality for significant gains in performance and energy efficiency. This project aims to exploit this opportunity and develop a comprehensive framework for approximation in Graphic Processing Units along with effective quality control mechanisms based on coding theory. Energy efficiency is arguably the biggest challenge of the computing industry. To maintain the nation's economic leadership in this industry, it is vital to develop solutions, such as this project, that address the fundamental challenges of energy-efficient computing. The computing industry has reached an era in which many of the innovative techniques, such as this work, crosses the boundary of multiple disciplines, including computer architecture, information theory, and signal processing. Thus, it is imperative to educate a workforce that not only deeply understands multiple disciples, but also can innovate across their boundaries. This project provides a foundation for such education and research. This project will produce benchmarks, tools and general infrastructure. These artifacts will be made publicly available and will be integrated in the Georgia Tech and Harvard curricula. To transfer these technologies, the principle investigators have established close contacts with several companies. Besides the customary routes academics use to disseminate results, the principle investigator will continue organizing workshops on approximate computing. The principle investigator is also coauthoring a book on approximate computing, which will include results from this project. The investigators are committed to diversity and inclusion of undergraduate, underrepresented, and high school students and are currently mentoring students from all groups that will continue throughout this project. <br/><br/>This project will first develop an accelerated architecture for Graphic Processing Units, which leverage an approximate algorithmic transformation for faster and more energy efficient execution. The core idea is to use neural models to learn how a region of code behaves and replace the region with a hardware accelerator that is tightly integrated within the many cores of the Graphic Processing Units. Second, inspired by Shannon's work and the success of random codes in providing reliable communication over noisy channels, this work will devise quality control solutions that utilize coding techniques to reduce the imprecision. The code is implicit in a sense that whenever an approximate output must be improved, its correlation with available exact outputs is exploited for constructing and decoding the code. Third, the project will study mechanisms that leverage the inherent similarity and predictability in the real-world data to address the memory bottlenecks in Graphic Processing Units. The main idea is to predict the values of a data load operation when it misses in the local on-chip cache and continue the computation without waiting for the long-latency response from the off-chip memory. To perform effective prediction, this project will develop multi-regime adaptive nonlinear time-varying dynamical models for the input data using our new theories of model matching."

However, wireless sensor networks usually need to collect and transmit vast amounts of data. Utilizing the random, non-uniform, and scarce harvested energy intelligently to meet the energy demand caused by ""big data"" is extremely challenging. The real-time latency requirement for data delivery makes the problem even more complicated. This project overcomes these challenges through strategically allocating the stochastic energy resources to collect and transmit the most important sensor data, providing a reliable pipeline for data collection, transmission and analysis in energy harvesting sensor networks. The project is expected to have direct impact on the design and wide deployment of energy harvesting wireless sensor networks, with applications in radio spectrum management, environment monitoring, healthcare, surveillance, disaster relief, etc. Furthermore, the proposed work has widespread potential applications far beyond energy harvesting wireless sensor networks, such as automatic residential energy consumption scheduling in smart grid, micro-grid planning with renewable energy inputs, information extraction from astronomical amounts of data collected from large-scale participatory sensing, etc. The proposed project integrates a research agenda with a strong educational component and will serve the following educational purposes: 1) the PI will use the proposed project to stimulate and maintain undergraduate students' interests in engineering via undergraduate research, senior project design and project based learning; 2) the requested funding will be used to train graduate students via curriculum development, proper research mentoring and industry collaboration; and 3) the proposed project will be used to attract potential engineering students through various outreach activities. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to construct a new paradigm of sensing and transmission schemes in data-intensive energy harvesting wireless sensor networks to intelligently utilize the random, non-uniform, and scarce harvested energy with analytically provable sensing, transmission and inference performance guarantees. Two different but closely coupled approaches are proposed to achieve this goal. One is an energy-driven approach and the other is a data-driven approach. For the energy-driven approach, the statistics of the energy harvesting process are exploited to construct online sensing and transmission schemes. Two main tasks addressed in this research thrust are objective-oriented cooperative sensing scheduling policies to cope with the non-uniform energy supply in large-scale sensor networks, and delay-constrained data transmission schemes to meet the real-time latency requirement. The data-driven approach utilizes the characteristics of the underlying sensing phenomena to adaptively and strategically allocate scarce energy resources for the collection and transmission of the most important sensor data. Two specific tasks in this research thrust include a Gaussian process based framework to systematically utilize the spatial-temporal correlations in sensing fields, and adaptive sensing strategies that exploit the structured sparsity of underlying sensing signals, both under the stochastic energy constraints at sensors. The project promises to build intelligent energy harvesting wireless sensor networks with superb sensing, transmission and inference performances on a solid analytical foundation. The delay-constrained information theoretic analysis for energy harvesting communications will integrate a new set of analytical tools from renewal theory with tools in information theory, and create synergies between them. The proposed data-driven adaptive sensing approach will develop synergies between stochastic queueing control and high-dimensional data analysis. The interdisciplinary nature of the research allows us to utilize techniques from stochastic queueing control, renewal theory, information theory, machine learning and is expected to advance the understanding of those areas."

The proposed research will improve the resilience of smart grids to cyber-attacks in meters, parameters, topology and communication infrastructure and large physical disturbances by developing new techniques for distributed control of large complex systems that guarantees secure and reliable performance.

The PIs plan to teach short courses on smart grid security at conferences.  In addition, they plan to engage under-represented minority students in their project. <br/><br/>The project aims at developing a distributed nonlinear controller for transient stability enhancement. The new control layer will actuate on distributed energy storage systems, be robust to uncertainties in modelling and capable of compensating input time-delay while independent of operating conditions.

Ultrasound is studied because it is a wireless, high resolution, medically safe, and inherently secure technology that is driving innovations in wearables, medical implants, secure / encrypted communication systems, and imaging. The project's neural network algorithms can characterize materials and engineered systems from the micro-level (e.g., micro-electrical-mechanical systems) to the macro-level (e.g., pipelines, airplanes, or rail lines). The neural networks characterize the materials by learning the general behavior of ultrasound from simulated data, physical constraints, and measured data. That learned behavior is then compared with the true measured behavior.  To achieve our goal, three significant challenges of applying neural networks (and machine learning generally) to many engineered systems are studied: (1) experimental training data is often scarce or unavailable, (2) data diversity and variability is typically high, and (3) purely data-driven approaches offer few engineering assurances. Data scarcity is addressed by training neural networks with simulations rather than experimental data. Data diversity and variability is addressed by using transfer learning theory to transfer generalized knowledge from the simulation data into the analysis of the experimental data. Engineering assurances are improved by incorporating physics-based constraints into the neural networks. The resulting neural networks are referred to as Helmholtz networks, named for the time-independent wave equation.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to establish the foundation for Helmholtz networks, which are deep, generative, physics-informed neural networks that reconstruct ultrasonic wave propagation and locate ultrasonic sources. The Helmholtz networks are based on the fact that each frequency of a wave can be represented as the sum of a sparse number of spatial modes. The modes are constrained by the Helmholtz equation and this physical constraint ensures that the machine learning algorithm is trustworthy for system-critical engineered systems (e.g., health monitoring of an aircraft). Such physics-informed machine learning is an important (albeit not widely studied) topic for integrating advanced computation tools into real-time engineered systems. <br/>The research thrusts of this proposal are to initiate and explore the foundations for three new types of neural networks: (1) generative Helmholtz networks to learn modal representations of waves and reconstruct wavefields, (2) localization networks to locate ultrasonic sources under uncertainties, and (3) localization Helmholtz networks to locate sources from learned modal representations. Thrust 1 explores the creation of generative models (i.e., generative Helmholtz networks) that learn the spatial modal characteristics of a medium from simulations. These generative models then reconstruct wavefields from undersampled test data. Thrust 2 studies localization networks to locate ultrasonic sources under simulated uncertainties, such as velocity, delay, and/or amplitude uncertainty. Thrust 3 investigates the use of transfer learning to combine Thrust 1 and Thrust 2 and use the learned modes to locate sources in geometrically complex media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is vitally important to have accurate predictive nitrogen soil models that can help farmers reduce fertilizer use by knowing exactly what type of fertilizer to use and precisely when and where in a field to apply.  However, the accuracy of these soil models is lacking because soil nitrogen concentration data acquired at numerous points within a field is currently cost prohibitive and technically challenging.  This research will create low-cost sensors that can electrically transmit soil nitrogen levels (ammonium and nitrate ion concentration levels) from various soil depths and locations to a central hub so that data can be transmitted through the internet and analyzed remotely.  Sensors that can be fitted with low-cost data transmission electronics will be made of low-cost graphene (carbon) that is disposable and can be created using scalable manufacturing protocols.  The completed sensors will be tested in the soils surrounding tomato plants to acquire high resolution spatial and temporal nitrogen data for improving soil nitrogen models that can be utilized by farmers.  <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop bury-and-forget nitrogen sensors coupled with remote sensing technologies for real-time analysis of soil health. The sensors will be developed with flexible graphene electrodes functionalized with ionophore membranes for sensing of ammonium and nitrate ions in soils using laser inscribing and inkjet printing techniques (Aim 1). A network of these sensors will be developed using commercial Bluetooth-based mesh network modules for sensor power, computing, and communications (Aim 2). This project will elucidate the sensor depth and broadcast frequency that is capable/needed for successful in-soil nitrogen monitoring using a bucket brigade approach. This sensor network will be merged with existing crop models developed and challenged with in-field relevant conditions using a model tomato system in a testbed facility (Aim 3). The testbed facility will be used for collecting high resolution nitrogen sensor data from the soil coupled with monitoring of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of the plants as benchmarks to integrate remote sensing and real-time field measurements. The proposed project will lead to new: 1) wireless nitrogen sensors (both labile and mobile); 2) knowledge of spatiotemporal dynamics of soil nitrogen coupled with above ground plant physiology; 3) knowledge of scaling micro/nanosensor subsurface soil data, long-duration signal acquisition/curation, and pinpointing the maximum wireless data transmission depth in soil; and 4) best management practices for coupling soil sensor results to current field-scale tools such as remote sensing. The project will be the first to connect in-situ nanosensors, remote sensing, and crop modeling for the same sample, therein establishing a platform for improving understanding of soil biogeochemistry, sensor networks, and fundamental spatiotemporal scaling principles.  This project will facilitate rapid studies for improving empirical model parameters (crop coefficients), as well as to validate assumptions in remote sensing (links between yellowing leaves and nutrient stress) and in-situ soil sensors (nutrient fate and transport). In addition to testing the developed sensor systems, this project will establish strategies and best practices for the development, testing, and deployment of soil nutrient sensors that can be reproduced anywhere for sensor testing and/or hypothesis testing, leading to improved models and observation networks to manage soil health. Such sensor networks and resultant models are expected to lead to precision agriculture where fertilizers are spread onto specific locations of the field in a metered fashion only when needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The applications resulting from these possibilities require increasingly broader bandwidth. This ever-increasing need for broader bandwidth over a very crowded spectrum below 30 gigahertz (GHz) necessitates new paradigm shifts to enable spectrally efficient communications. Improving spectral efficiency by only increasing the complexity of modulation schemes to 256-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) or higher is expected to plateau, as it exerts stringent design requirements that are impossible to achieve given the power budget constraint in a wireless system. On the other hand, the vastly under-utilized spectrum across the terahertz (THz) band, commonly referred to the frequency band from 300 GHz to 3 THz, has prompted researchers to investigate futuristic wireless systems that can potentially achieve 10+ gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates, normally only achievable in wired (copper or optical) links. The availability of wide spectrum over the THz band also addresses a challenging requirement associated with conventional wireless links, that is, the need to accommodate very complex modulation schemes to enhance spectral efficiency so as to best take advantage of an already congested band at lower radio frequencies (i.e., 30 GHz and below). <br/><br/>The main objective of this interdisciplinary research project is to study, design, and implement novel integrated phased-array wireless transmitter architectures that are amenable to frequency scaling and will be the core enabling blocks for a wireless infrastructure that can potentially achieve 50 Gbps line-of-sight (LOS) wireless connectivity over a 20-50m link range. The project will leverage prior experience and knowledge established in the PIs? research groups in the areas of silicon-based THz integrated circuits design as well as multi-antenna wireless communication theory.  This proposal will develop new phased-array transmitter architectures that overcome the above challenges. Specifically, we propose a phase locked loop based phased-array with no need of local oscillators or radio-frequency phase shifters and front-end power amplifiers. Importantly, we exploit the non-linearity of front-end frequency triplers to combine three streams of lower bandwidth intermediate-frequency data right before the high data rate signal is radiated by the antennas. We propose to study analog beamforming and hybrid analog/digital beamforming methods that are fine-tuned to specific phased-array structures proposed in this project so as to provide efficient adaptive beam-steering. This clearly requires a close collaboration between circuits and communications experts to address many challenges. As proof of concept, we will design and implement a 300-GHz, 16-element phased-array transmitter. Upon successful fabrication and temporal/spectral measurements, we will expand our current indoor wireless testing setup and conduct outdoor wireless testing."

To alleviate these problems, this project explores ways to design wireless links at terahertz frequencies that can provide data rates of hundreds of gigabytes per second that would alleviate ""cable management"" and ""pin-count"" problems. Insights and results from this project will develop fundamental understanding of wireless propagation at terahertz frequencies and also stimulate further related research in wireless communications and computer engineering.<br/><br/>Wireless data communications between co-located computer systems, such as datacenter blades and racks, would greatly help alleviate the ""cable management"" problem that arises in datacenters, where physical routing of the many data cables creates airflow, serviceability, and even reliability problems.

Equipped with diverse sensors, from GPS to camera, and paired with the inherent mobility of their owners, mobile devices are capable of acquiring rich information of surrounding environment. However, the wide adoption of mobile crowd sensing is largely hindered by its privacy concerns. To facilitate the functionality of each stage of mobile crowd sensing, including sensing task allocation, sensing data collection, and result aggregation, sensing devices report their location information, sensing capabilities, task preferences, and sensing results to servers that will potentially disclose their daily routings, behavior patterns and even identities. With these concerns, the overall goal of this project is to address privacy leakage issues from different stages of mobile crowd sensing. Privacy-enhanced mobile crowd sensing will attract more participants and thus accelerate the maturity of smart health care, environment monitoring, traffic surveillance, social event observation, etc. In addition, this project will also serve as a training ground for educating future decision-makers and workforce on theory and tools. <br/><br/>The PIs plan to develop effective and efficient privacy preservation schemes for different stages of mobile crowd sensing. It corresponds to three closely intertwined research thrusts. Thrust I explores protecting user's sensitive information, such as locations, sensing capabilities and task preferences, from the server, while still allowing it to optimally or approximately solve task allocation problems. Rather than highly computationally-intensive crypto-based techniques, privacy preservation schemes will be designed based on decomposition methods and distributed computing algorithms.

This is important for handling future cellular data traffic, expected to grow at a rate of 40-70% annually. As existing cellular bands are already crowded, it is necessary to explore other bands, and more specifically millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. Critical issues for practical millimeter wave transceivers on handhelds are power and bandwidth handling. With this in mind, the goal of this research is to explore power-reduced and hardware-reduced transceivers to realize several concurrent high gain beams for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and to concurrently overcome propagation losses for cellular connectivity. Achieving these goals is expected to have transformative impact on all aspects of wireless communications. Concurrently, the large available bandwidth at millimeter wave frequencies will enable secure wireless communications systems for large data rate transfers. This research is also in line with the National Broadband Plan aimed at providing every American with affordable access to robust broadband services. Moreover, this project will train students in emerging wireless technologies. Specifically, a variety of outreach activities are planned to attract undergraduates and underrepresented students in engineering, including high school students through summer camps and wireless connectivity projects relating to 1) medical sensors, 2) short distance communication applications and 3) energy harvesting using ambient RF signals.   Examples of societal impact include the realization of reliable high bandwidth handhelds and secure wireless communications systems for large data rate transfers.<br/><br/>Several innovations are proposed to enable practical use of the yet unharnessed capacity of the mm-wave spectrum. Among them are: 1) Novel ultra-wideband arrays that incorporate balanced feeds. 2) Hybrid frequency and code division multiplexing for secure high data rate communications to cover an unprecedented 10GHz bandwidth. 3) A beamformer architecture that combines all antenna array signals into a single analog-to-digital (ADC)/digital-to-analog (DAC) converter without loss of signal path identity. This is done by introducing a novel on-site code division multiplexing technique. It is noted that reduction of ADCs and DACs by a factor of 10 or more implies proportional reduction in power usage and back-end circuitry. 4) Hybrid integration of the phased array with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) and/or III-V transceiver and associated digital beamforming processor. Antenna arrays will be fabricated on low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrates and be vertically integrated to ensure the highest possible gain and compactness. 5) Indoor/Outdoor measurements of the aforementioned integrated mm-wave system to characterize the impact of line-of-sight (LOS) versus non-LOS links, range, angle of arrival distributions, pathloss/shadowing, and delay spreads. Such outdoor measurements have yet to be performed at mm-waves using beamforming arrays."

Equipped with diverse sensors, from GPS to camera, and paired with the inherent mobility of their owners, mobile devices are capable of acquiring rich information of surrounding environment. However, the wide adoption of mobile crowd sensing is largely hindered by its privacy concerns. To facilitate the functionality of each stage of mobile crowd sensing, including sensing task allocation, sensing data collection, and result aggregation, sensing devices report their location information, sensing capabilities, task preferences, and sensing results to servers that will potentially disclose their daily routings, behavior patterns and even identities. With these concerns, the overall goal of this project is to address privacy leakage issues from different stages of mobile crowd sensing. Privacy-enhanced mobile crowd sensing will attract more participants and thus accelerate the maturity of smart health care, environment monitoring, traffic surveillance, social event observation, etc. In addition, this project will also serve as a training ground for educating future decision-makers and workforce on theory and tools. <br/><br/>The PIs plan to develop effective and efficient privacy preservation schemes for different stages of mobile crowd sensing. It corresponds to three closely intertwined research thrusts. Thrust I explores protecting user's sensitive information, such as locations, sensing capabilities and task preferences, from the server, while still allowing it to optimally or approximately solve task allocation problems. Rather than highly computationally-intensive crypto-based techniques, privacy preservation schemes will be designed based on decomposition methods and distributed computing algorithms.

Because no two events are ever identical, the knowledge learned from past events must be transferred to knowledge about present events that are not identical but only ""similar"" - and in ways that may not be known in advance and so must be discovered. <br/>* Learning and detection - and the actions that follow learning and detection ? must take place in a timely fashion: it is of little use to learn how to respond to an emergency only long after the emergency has passed.  <br/>To accomplish this, the proposed work relies on new methods to discover what is relevant both in each individual data stream and across data streams, and to learn and exploit the similarities between the past and the present.  This work is transformative and success in this project has the potential to lead to enormously enhanced, even life-saving, responses to emergencies of many sorts. <br/><br/>Existing approaches treat individual data streams by exploiting particular physical characteristics of the signal, and treat multiple data streams in an ad-hoc fashion.  These approaches miss the fact that it is not the physical characteristics of the signal that are important but rather the (semantic) information in the signal, and that there are connections between the information in different data streams. This project transforms the problem of learning from multiple (multi-modal) data streams by focusing on the relevance of information in each data stream, across data streams, and through time.  The relevant information will generally be different for different events and different purposes and will not be known in advance, so relevance must be learned.  To do this, this project organizes the information available at each moment in time in terms of contexts which encode exogenous metadata (e.g., when, where and by whom data was gathered) and endogenous metadata (e.g., features and statistics extracted from the data). In general, there are an enormous number and variety of contexts, but the most relevant information is embedded in only a few contexts. Because these most relevant contexts will not generally be known in advance and will be different in different scenarios, this project will develop a new class of methods and algorithms to discover the relevant contexts from multiple dynamic, multi-modal and high-dimensional data streams, and to use what is discovered to learn, detect and respond in a timely fashion.  Because no two events are exactly the same, this project will develop of a new class of methods and algorithms for the discovery of relevant semantic similarities and their application, making it possible to transfer knowledge learned from past events to knowledge about present events.

This project will address these challenges by developing a new paradigm of energy-aware sparse sensing scheme. The proposed scheme can significantly reduce the amount of data to be collected and processed in sensor networks powered by extremely limited energy sources, such as devices harvesting energy from light, vibration, or heat. The sparse sensing is enabled by the fact that some information is more important than others, thus the amount of collected information can be significantly reduced by sampling only the most essential information. In addition, the sparse sensing scheme can also be used for extracting useful information from an ocean of data that have already been collected by a system. This is especially important for crowd-sensing applications where a huge number of users voluntarily contribute sensing data with their smart phones or tablet computers. The proposed research will accelerate the wide range deployment of large-scale participatory sensing and energy-harvesting sensor networks. Results obtained from this project can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as disaster relief, stock market analysis, surveillance, and pollution monitoring, etc. This research will contribute to public safety, improve homeland security, and promote the social and economic development of the United States. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to conquer the ""big data"" challenge in large-scale energy-constrained sensing applications through a new paradigm of energy-aware sparse sensing, which dynamically and sparsely samples a random field by adapting to the energy availability of sensors and the time-varying nature of the monitored objects. The energy-aware sparse sensing scheme can significantly reduce the amount of data to be collected and processed, bridge the gap between energy supplies and energy demands in energy-constrained systems, and provide energy-efficient and scalable solutions to large-scale sensing applications. The specific research thrusts leading to this goal include: 1) Create a new paradigm of dynamic sparse sensing. The dynamic sparse sensing is enabled by ""information diversity"", i.e., data collected at different space locations and time instants have different impacts on a certain design objective. Thus the number of required samples can be significantly reduced by sampling only the most informative data, which can be adaptively identified by learning through previous sensing results.  2) Design energy-aware sparse sensing techniques for systems powered by energy harvesting devices such as photovoltaic or thermal devices. For systems with energy harvesting devices, there is energy diversity due to non-uniform energy supplies across the sensors. The energy-aware sparse sensing is achieved by aligning energy diversity with information diversity, so that the limited energy resources are used to collect the most informative data."

Today, there are well over a billion such twisted pairs installed globally, an infrastructure which has been the basis for nearly all telephone connections for over 100 years. In the late 1980s Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) services were developed, in which an RF signal carrying digital data was essentially piggy-backed on top of the same copper wires used for analog voice signals. Through advances in data encoding and frequency multiplexing, these systems can now typically deliver data at gigabit per second rates. The astounding (and ongoing) commercial success of DSL arises largely from the fact that these services do not require new wire or fiber connections (which cost thousands of dollars per customer to install), but instead can deliver high bit rates to customers using the existing infrastructure. However, advances in encoding and multiplexing have nearly reached their limit, so the only way to further increase the data rate is to increase the frequency of the RF carrier wave, since there is more bandwidth available at higher frequencies. The proposed research will explore the use of these existing copper twisted-cables for transmission of signals at much higher frequencies than those that have previously been employed in DSL systems. Similar multiplexing and encoding schemes will be necessary, due to the unavoidable mixing of these high-frequency signals as they propagate along these non-uniform cables. If these signal processing approaches are still useful at high frequencies, and if the overall signal loss is not too high, then this initial demonstration will validate the feasibility of operating a DSL-like system with a data rate of a terabit per second, vastly higher than anything that has been envisioned previously. This would open up an entirely new realm for fixed (not wireless) data services.<br/><br/>This EAGER proposal suggests a radically new way to think about DSL transmission systems. In all discussions to date, the fundamental physics of the electromagnetic signal propagation is described using the language of transmission lines. Conventionally, a transmission line guides an electrical signal by propagation of a time-varying voltage between a pair of electrically isolated conductors. However, when the free-space wavelength of the guided wave approaches the relevant dimensions (e.g., the distance between the two conductors), it is more appropriate to describe this transmission process using the language of waveguides. Inspired by the fact that the typical free-space distance between wires in a twisted-wire pair can be on the order of a millimeter, this project seeks to study the use of millimeter waves or terahertz waves as the carriers for modulated digital data on twisted-pair cables, acting as waveguides. This proposal seeks to initiate a research collaboration between the PI at Brown University and engineers at ASSIA, Inc. This company specializes in the software and signal processing that enables efficient use of spectrum in DSL systems. Their expertise, in particular in the area of vectoring (conceptually equivalent to MIMO in wireless systems), combined with the PI's expertise in millimeter-wave and terahertz waveguides, represents a unique team which is ideally positioned to carry out the proposed exploratory research program. The approach involves the experimental characterization of the waveguide modes (all output modes for each possible input excitation) for a set of model cable systems, starting from a simple single-twisted-pair and working up to more complicated (and longer) waveguides. The effects of modal dispersion, dielectric loss, and bends will be studied, and the results will be used as inputs in channel models developed by ASSIA to predict the rate and range performance characteristics. This work represents the first realistic exploration of the idea of using millimeter waves for long-distance guided-wave data transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Expert analyses show that in 2011, the amount of generated data surpassed 1.8 zeta bytes and will increase by a factor of 50 until 2020. To overcome these challenges, both the semiconductor industry and the research community are exploring new avenues in computing. Two of the promising approaches are acceleration and approximation. Among accelerators, Graphic Processing Units provide significant compute capabilities. Graphic Processing Units, originally designed to accelerate graphics functions, now are processing large amounts of real-world data that are collected from sensors, radar, environment, financial markets, and medical devices. As Graphic Processing Units play a major role in accelerating many classes of applications, improving their performance and energy efficiency has become imperative. This project leverages the fact that many applications that benefit from Graphic Processing Units are amenable to imprecise computation. This characteristic provides an opportunity to devise approximation techniques that trade small losses in the output quality for significant gains in performance and energy efficiency. This project aims to exploit this opportunity and develop a comprehensive framework for approximation in Graphic Processing Units along with effective quality control mechanisms based on coding theory. Energy efficiency is arguably the biggest challenge of the computing industry. To maintain the nation's economic leadership in this industry, it is vital to develop solutions, such as this project, that address the fundamental challenges of energy-efficient computing. The computing industry has reached an era in which many of the innovative techniques, such as this work, crosses the boundary of multiple disciplines, including computer architecture, information theory, and signal processing. Thus, it is imperative to educate a workforce that not only deeply understands multiple disciples, but also can innovate across their boundaries. This project provides a foundation for such education and research. This project will produce benchmarks, tools and general infrastructure. These artifacts will be made publicly available and will be integrated in the Georgia Tech and Harvard curricula. To transfer these technologies, the principle investigators have established close contacts with several companies. Besides the customary routes academics use to disseminate results, the principle investigator will continue organizing workshops on approximate computing. The principle investigator is also coauthoring a book on approximate computing, which will include results from this project. The investigators are committed to diversity and inclusion of undergraduate, underrepresented, and high school students and are currently mentoring students from all groups that will continue throughout this project. <br/><br/>This project will first develop an accelerated architecture for Graphic Processing Units, which leverage an approximate algorithmic transformation for faster and more energy efficient execution. The core idea is to use neural models to learn how a region of code behaves and replace the region with a hardware accelerator that is tightly integrated within the many cores of the Graphic Processing Units. Second, inspired by Shannon's work and the success of random codes in providing reliable communication over noisy channels, this work will devise quality control solutions that utilize coding techniques to reduce the imprecision. The code is implicit in a sense that whenever an approximate output must be improved, its correlation with available exact outputs is exploited for constructing and decoding the code. Third, the project will study mechanisms that leverage the inherent similarity and predictability in the real-world data to address the memory bottlenecks in Graphic Processing Units. The main idea is to predict the values of a data load operation when it misses in the local on-chip cache and continue the computation without waiting for the long-latency response from the off-chip memory. To perform effective prediction, this project will develop multi-regime adaptive nonlinear time-varying dynamical models for the input data using our new theories of model matching."

However, the accuracy of these soil models is lacking because soil nitrogen concentration data acquired at numerous points within a field is currently cost prohibitive and technically challenging.  This research will create low-cost sensors that can electrically transmit soil nitrogen levels (ammonium and nitrate ion concentration levels) from various soil depths and locations to a central hub so that data can be transmitted through the internet and analyzed remotely.  Sensors that can be fitted with low-cost data transmission electronics will be made of low-cost graphene (carbon) that is disposable and can be created using scalable manufacturing protocols.  The completed sensors will be tested in the soils surrounding tomato plants to acquire high resolution spatial and temporal nitrogen data for improving soil nitrogen models that can be utilized by farmers.  <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop bury-and-forget nitrogen sensors coupled with remote sensing technologies for real-time analysis of soil health. The sensors will be developed with flexible graphene electrodes functionalized with ionophore membranes for sensing of ammonium and nitrate ions in soils using laser inscribing and inkjet printing techniques (Aim 1). A network of these sensors will be developed using commercial Bluetooth-based mesh network modules for sensor power, computing, and communications (Aim 2). This project will elucidate the sensor depth and broadcast frequency that is capable/needed for successful in-soil nitrogen monitoring using a bucket brigade approach. This sensor network will be merged with existing crop models developed and challenged with in-field relevant conditions using a model tomato system in a testbed facility (Aim 3). The testbed facility will be used for collecting high resolution nitrogen sensor data from the soil coupled with monitoring of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of the plants as benchmarks to integrate remote sensing and real-time field measurements.

However, new applications as implantable bio-potential sensors or submersible sensors for measuring mechanical stress require further miniaturization of existing state-of-the-art sensors hardware. As an additional challenge, these applications often require a significantly increased transmission data rate due to the need to perform multichannel sensing. Consequently, these approaches require the design of very low-power sensor hardware architectures, which can support reliable and secure transmission over these high-speed data links. Rather than studying the performance of traditional sensor architectures, signal processing techniques, and forward error correction (FEC) strategies for these challenging requirements, the goal of the proposed research is find and study novel low-complexity asynchronous communication and error correction strategies that are tailored to this emerging class of highly miniaturized low-power integrated wireless sensors. The results of this study have the potential to remove the power and throughput limitations given by traditional sensor hardware based on synchronous signal processing, and thus to enable significant advances in many sensing applications. In particular, the proposed research is able to provide a significant transformative impact on many other applications employing low-power modulation schemes, even outside the field of sensor systems. Another important aspect of the project is the education plan that combines the cross-disciplinary strengths of the PIs. This includes the integration of the research results into existing curricula, student exchanges, conference tutorials, and open access to all details of the proposed sensor architectures.<br/><br/>The proposed project will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in integrated low-power low-complexity high-data-rate wireless sensor design by employing ideas from circuit design, signal processing, coding, and communication theory and practice in an interdisciplinary fashion. Specifically, a systematic solution for integrated wireless sensors will be developed by devising asynchronous delta modulation on the sensor interface in combination with asynchronous ultra wideband (UWB) transmission on the wireless radio interface in order to extensively decrease the power consumption of the sensor hardware. Further, to ensure that the sensor operates with guaranteed reliability over the noisy communication link, new non-binary FEC schemes with low complexity encoding are analyzed, whose data symbols consist of both asynchronous timing information and pulse signs. In particular, the project contributions are 1) to study design and properties of a novel asynchronous sensor signal interface based on a switched-capacitor amplitude sampling circuit; 2) to investigate the open problem of efficient FEC solutions for sensors based on asynchronous data modulation; and 3) to develop and analyze an asynchronous radio interface based on frequency shift keying on-off keying modulation for UWB data transmission."

This two-fold data reduction (local processing and pulse encoding) enables high data-rate support within the specified bandwidth. The compressed data stream will then be fed to an injection-locked power oscillator to drive the antenna for wireless transmission. The proposed transformative large volume wireless data acquisition scheme will influence various sensor related applications and decision-making processes, such as transportation, public health, cortical mapping, smart homes, etc. The education goal is to integrate the artistic skills of underrepresented K-12 students to motivate, engage and help learning STEM materials through a fun loving environment and get them prepared for future STEM careers. The project will continue training undergraduate and graduate students, conduct summer camps, and promote outreach programs through ""It's Electric"", ""C3-STEM"" and UAB CORD program, to increase the number of underrepresented and minorities towards higher education.<br/><br/>In pursue of the research objectives in the SWiT-IoT project, mainly three research goals are targeted: (i) Energy-Efficient Local Processing for Data Reduction, (ii) An energy-efficient analog-RF chip level implementation of multi-order orthogonal pulse generator, and (iii) Spectral efficient orthogonal pulse based analog pulse-sequence encoding. First, a local processing unit will be investigated by employing oscillatory neural network (ONN) and improved spike detector algorithms. By utilizing ultra-low-power self-oscillating nodes, the ONN will perform class-associative pattern recognition task by synchrony or desynchrony among the nodes, and only relay the values of the recognition indicators frequency of synchronization and convergence time, instead of the raw data. A modified nonlinear energy operator based energy-efficient spike detector algorithm will be investigated for detecting signal events e.g. impact loading, action potentials, abrupt changes, etc. and relay the event stamp to reduce the data volume. Second, the SWiT-IoT project will investigate a Modified Hermite Polynomial based multi-order orthogonal pulse generation scheme. An innovative neuro-inspired architecture will be utilized with reduced system complexity, better energy-efficiency, and integrated circuit level implementation with smaller form factor. Third, a novel combinatorial pulse-sequence encoding will allow simultaneous multichannel wireless telemetry with superb spectrum-efficient data density and data security. In this scheme, n distinct multi-order orthogonal pulses will be used to create pulse-sequence for each channel. The use of (n-1) redundant orthogonal pulses for each channel will enable supporting a large number (= n!) of channels and (n-1)!-times of data rate improvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A comprehensive methodology referred to as DEFENDA - DEtection of FalsE and uNexpected Data Attacks - is proposed to quantify the integrity of data and to characterize the impact of false data on power systems. These attacks are referred to as unobservable or stealth false data injection (FDI) attacks, and they are crafted to bypass traditional bad data detection.  DEFENDA's vision is to quickly detect sensor manipulation attacks and correct the false data. The project aims to contribute enhanced state-of-the-art cyber-physical security strategies for transmission system operation, where results will inform solution of similar problems including cyber-physical attack detection at generation, transmission, and distribution levels as well as in communication networks, banking systems, cloud computing and storage, and other critical infrastructures. <br/><br/>DEFENDA will contribute attack detection strategies for real-world power grids via deep neural network (DNN) architectures known to offer superior representational power and improved detection performance. Specifically, DEFENDA aims to develop an efficient and robust FDI attack detection mechanism based on a deep long-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) that captures the time series nature of the status and measurement data and learns their respective normal and malicious patterns. To ensure detection efficiency, DEFENDA investigates optimal selection of the deep architecture and underlying hyper-parameters. Furthermore, DEFENDA ensures detection robustness through three measures. First, DEFENDA enables replacement of any missing status and measurement data via a deep LSTM auto-encoder (LSTM-AE) to enhance detection performance even in presence of jamming attacks. Second, using a deep variational LSTM auto-encoder (V-LSTM-AE) DEFENDA is capable to detect attacks that have not been characterized via an anomaly detector. Finally, DEFENDA carries out detection decision fusion based on centralized, semi-centralized, and decentralized detection architectures.  DEFENDA will also create and make available synthetic cases with scenarios designed to promote research in cyber-physical analysis and attack detection.

Consequently, data centers today are a significant contributor to global carbon emissions, making the design of data centers with improved efficiency an important societal need. The goal of this project is to reduce the power conversion losses in data centers through innovations in power electronics and system control, with the aim of extreme efficiency. This research program is expected to have far-reaching consequences for the economic and environmental impact of data centers. If successful, the large-scale adoption of the proposed power delivery architecture could save 4.44 billion kWh of energy in US data centers, based on conservative 2010 data and preliminary experimental results from an early proof-of-concept demonstration. These energy savings would in turn reduce harmful emissions equivalent to removing 850,000 cars from U.S. roads. Research will be conducted by undergraduate and graduate students who will be provided with opportunities to develop broad research and education skills. The research will complement existing educational efforts, and will help enhance community outreach programs. Additionally, educational activities include the development of power and energy focused educational modules for middle school teachers.<br/><br/>This research will explore a radically different power delivery architecture that is designed specifically for multi-machine environments such as racks of servers, and provides significant improvement both in terms of volume savings and power efficiency. The proposed power conversion architecture exploits the large number of servers available in today's data centers, and achieves extreme power conversion efficiency by electrically connecting servers in series, similar to solutions developed for solar PV and battery applications. Stringent voltage regulation and operational requirements will be met through the combination of a) isolated, high-efficiency, high power density differential power converters that maintain each server voltage within specifications, b) hardware circuitry that enables safe and reliable isolation and hot-swapping of malfunctioning servers, and c) system control that achieves high efficiency, and which handles start-up and shutdown of individual servers and racks of servers. The research plan includes major research components in the areas of power converter topologies; design, fabrication, and testing of high density switched-capacitor power converters; development of isolation and hot-swapping circuitry for safe and reliable operation; bidirectional hysteresis control for improved light-load efficiency; and evaluation and benchmarking against existing solutions."

Going forward, these fiber-optic links must scale to higher speeds at an acceptable cost in both dollars and in watts, but today's solutions, using on-off keyed signaling and power-sensing receivers, will not meet cost and dissipation targets as rates exceed 40 gigabits per second.  Neither will fiber-optic transceivers developed for telecommunication networks, as these require complex receivers, expensive lasers in both transmitter and receiver, and power-hungry digital signal processing.  To close the performance gap, this research program will investigate fiber-optic links in which the polarization of the transmitted light is switched to carry the data.  Polarization shift keying and Stokes vector modulation (which switches both the polarization and amplitude) can transmit multiple bits of data per transmitted symbol, greatly accelerating the link's data rate while maintaining tolerance to fiber loss and other signal impairments.  Research tasks will include theoretical study of noise impacts, optimization of advanced transmitter and receiver designs, simulation of polarization-modulated communication links, and experimental study in a lab testbed that incorporates dynamic optical networking.  The timely and practical focus of this project will offer graduate and undergraduate students excellent opportunities to develop into productive practitioners in communications, fiber optics, and data center design.  Beyond its direct impact on the student researchers, the program will offer additional educational benefits to the broader community by presenting lab tours and demonstrations to college and high-school students who might otherwise lack an opportunity to experience modern fiber-optic technology.  Finally, by advancing the state of the art in data center technology, the project will contribute to economic growth as well as helping to keep the U.S. innovation pipeline well-filled.  <br/><br/>The primary technical objective of this research program is to advance the understanding of multi-dimensional modulation techniques based on polarization-shift keying and Stokes vector modulation, as applied to fiber-optic transceivers for terabit-class data center networks (i.e., photonic networks in which each wavelength channel carries about 1 terabit per second of data).  Such research is critically needed because no existing technique has been found that offers both the data throughput and the cost needed to support Big Data applications in the 2020-2030 timeframe.  Scaling of massive data centers to meet future demands will require a radical shift in optical data link technology.  Current development based on pulse amplitude modulation will not be able to reach the 1 terabit per second level, because it is based on a one-dimensional symbol space.  Coherent lightwave systems developed for long-distance telecommunications offer multi-dimensional symbol spaces, but they are too costly and power-hungry, and their slow setup times will inhibit the rapid dynamic networking needed for data center networks.  Polarization-based modulation formats can provide 2-D, 3-D, or even 4 D symbol spaces using direct (i.e. non-coherent) detection, once critical challenges are overcome.  This program will study fundamental issues of symbol constellations and noise mapping into Stokes space, as well as low-complexity digital signal processing and multiple-input, multiple-output techniques to enhance both receivers and transmitters.  Alternative Stokes vector receiver designs will be compared theoretically and experimentally for both unimpaired link budgets and impairment tolerance. In support of dynamic topologies, performance under rapid optical switching/routing will be directly tested.  At all stages, the work will be socialized through publications, presentations, and bilateral collaborations, while preparing students to enter the industrial and academic communities."

The main challenge is that the often large amount of acquired raw sensed data does not provide any clue of what lies beneath the sensed field. The acquired sensor data contain information about different and unknown in number phenomena of interest. The vision of this project is the development and analysis of an algorithmic framework that has the ability to learn the unknown structure of a monitored field and enable the mining and exploration of information in heterogeneous sensor data. The techniques developed in this project will enable learning of the sensed field while effectively reducing the usually large amount of sensor data that need to be processed by removing irrelevant and non-informative sensor measurements. This research project will introduce benefits in a wide span of areas including analysis and mining of ecological and climatic data.  The proposed techniques will be capable of analyzing heterogeneous sensor data sets with different information content and adhering to different statistical models. It will pave the way for efficient learning schemes that extract the informative portion of the sensed data, and remove irrelevant or noisy sensor measurements that can hurt any subsequent data processing/inference task.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the development of general algorithms that have learning capabilities and can identify different informative portions, in a data vector sequence, which may adhere to different data models. The task of clustering data into groups that contain information about different sources is translated into a sparsity-aware canonical correlation analysis formulation. Building on this link, a generalized toolbox is proposed to address settings where the number of information sources and their statistical behavior is unknown. The proposed framework has the potential to uncover multiple information data clusters that may exhibit different statistical behavior, and separate them before applying standard statistical inference tasks. Different from the notion of outliers which are present in a small number of data, the project involves the design of a novel framework that allows the extraction and elimination of corrupted data affecting an arbitrary in size data portion. The idea is to exploit the low-dimensionality that informative data usually have, and identify corrupted data by controlling the rank of the corresponding covariance matrix to be in agreement with the low dimension of the informative data. Distributed optimization tools are also explored to deal with high-dimensional and spatially scattered data."

The fast growing renewable generation puts forth great operational challenges since they will cause large, frequent, and random fluctuations in supply. Data centers, on the other hand, offer large flexible loads in the grid. Leveraging this flexibility, this project will develop fundamental theories and algorithms for sustainable data centers with a dual goal of improving data center energy efficiency and accelerating the integration of renewables in the grid via data center demand response (DR) and workload management.  Specifically, the research findings will shed light on data center demand response while maintaining their performance, which will help data centers to decide how to participate in power market programs. Further, the success of data center demand response will help increase renewable energy integration and reduce the carbon footprint of data centers, contributing to global sustainability. The PIs will leverage fruitful collaboration to eventually bring the research to bear on ongoing industry standardization and development efforts. The PIs teach courses spanning networks, games, smart grid and optimization, and are strongly committed to promoting diversity by providing research opportunities to underrepresented students.  <br/><br/>Built on the PIs expertise on data centers and the smart grid, this project takes an interdisciplinary approach to develop fundamental theories and algorithms for sustainable data centers. The research tasks are organized under two well-coordinated thrusts, namely agile data center DR and adaptive workload management. The strategies and decisions of data center DR will be made based on the workload management algorithms that balance quality of service and energy efficiency and determine the supply functions. The workload management algorithms will optimize quality of service under the electric load constraints imposed by DR accordingly. This project will make three unique contributions: (1) new market programs with strategic participation of data centers in DR, instead of passive price takers, (2) fundamental understanding of the impacts of power network constraints on data center DR and new distributed algorithms for solving optimal power flow with stochastic renewable supplies, and (3) high-performance dynamic server provisioning and load balancing algorithms for large scale data centers under time-varying and stochastic electric load constraints and on-site renewable generation."

Better understanding of these performance limits and tradeoffs will significant enhance capabilities for collection, processing, and communication of analog sensor data beyond the current state of the art. These capabilities are particularly acute for emerging sensor network applications in health and wellness, security, energy-efficient infrastructures, and smart cities, where many low-cost low-energy analog sensors will be collecting large amounts of data and transmitting it to remote locations for processing. <br/><br/>The proposed research will investigate the interplay between sampling, quantization, communication and reconstruction of analog signals under memory constraints, communication constraints, and energy constraints.

Specific Shannon-theoretical limits for the performance of combined sampling and source coding - the tradeoff between the digitizer's sampling rate and quantization precision in terms of distortion will be investigated. In addition, the optimal fidelity in the reconstruction of analog data from a sequence of samples will be derived. Fundamental limits on communication under energy constraints, where an analog sensor must digitize and communication its data under finite energy constraints, will be determined. Methods used will draw from prior work in Shannon capacity, rate-distortion theory, joint source-channel coding and separation, sampling, estimation, and statistics. In particular, after extending existing results on rate-distortion theory to incorporate sub-Nyquist sampling, joint source-channel coding techniques applied to the sampled analog data transmitted over a rate-limited channel will be developed.

Detection delay, which is defined as the time difference between the occurrence and detection of an anomaly event, is critical for many practical applications. A longer detection delay might lead to catastrophic results, such as the collapse of a bridge or the loss of power to millions of people. With a shorter detection delay, remedial actions or countermeasures can be carried out in a timely manner to significantly reduce the damages caused by faults, attacks, accidents, or disasters. This project will develop a new paradigm of low-latency anomaly detection methods that can minimize the detection delay while maintaining satisfactory detection accuracy. This is different from most current anomaly detection techniques, which focus solely on detection accuracy with little or no attention given to detection delays. The proposed low-latency anomaly detection methods can be applied to a wide range of civil, industrial, scientific, and military applications, such as power plants, communication networks, surveillance, structure health monitoring, and financial transactions. Outcomes of the proposed research work can significantly reduce the response time to anomaly events, thus minimizing the damages and economic losses caused by cyber-attacks, system failures, fraudulent activities, or natural disasters. Technologies developed through this project can improve the safety and security in both the physical and cyber-space, and promote the competitiveness and economic development of the United States. Expertise gained through the proposed research work will be used to facilitate the development of new course materials and student research projects, and enhance students' learning experiences from the perspectives of both technology innovations and social impacts.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop low-latency anomaly detection methods with imperfect data models. The design objective is to minimize the detection delay while maintaining satisfactory detection accuracy. One of the most formidable challenges faced by low-latency anomaly detection is the accurate modeling of the data used during detection. Since a decision needs to be made with minimum delay, there is extremely limited amount of data that can be used for model training or model selection, especially for data generated by the anomaly events. In recognition of the paramount difficulty in obtaining the precise data models, this project aims to proactively develop new detection methods tailored specifically for imperfect data models. The proposed research activities will transform the research on anomaly detection from the following perspectives. First, using detection delay instead of detection accuracy as the primary design metric can significantly reduce the amount of time required to detect an anomaly event, while still maintaining satisfactory detection accuracy through additional design constraints. Second, the low-latency detection algorithms are designed specifically for systems with imperfect data models. The fundamental performance limits imposed by model uncertainty on the detection latency are analytically characterized by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and imperfect models. The analytical results are used to guide the design of parametric and non-parametric low-latency algorithms, which can provide a theoretical guarantee on the worst case delay. Third, the newly developed theories and algorithms will be applied to the fault detection of electrical machines and the intrusion detection for smart grids, where the designs are performed by considering the unique challenges and opportunities of these cyber-physical systems."

However, the ultimate goal in many information-processing tasks is to infer some parameters of interest, that govern the statistical and physical model of the data. This includes applications ranging from source localization in radar and imaging systems to inferring latent variables in machine learning.  The number of parameters in such problems is much smaller than the acquired volume of data, which leads to the possibility of more intelligent ways of sensing high dimensional signals, that can exploit the statistical model of the signal (with or without invoking sparsity), and the physics of the problem. The objective of this project is to develop a systematic theory of smart sampling and information retrieval algorithms for modern sensing systems that exploit the correlation structure of high dimensional signals to significantly reduce the number of measurements needed for inference.  The proposed research can lead to deployment of fewer sensors (than what is traditionally required), as well as more energy efficient ways to collect and process spatio-temporal data that will positively impact a number of applications across disciplines, such as, high resolution imaging, remote sensing, neural signal processing and wireless communication.  The educational component of this project aims at integrating the research outcomes into innovative teaching platforms such as ''Sense Smarter'', and ''Signals Everywhere'' that will help train the next generation of electrical engineers, and encourage them to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The technical component of the project has three interconnected goals: (i) designing fundamentally new geometries for correlation-aware samplers that exploit the statistical as well as physical signal models, (ii) developing, and analyzing the performance of new correlation driven algorithms to understand fundamental capabilities of correlation-aware samplers, and (iii) exploiting the ideas behind correlation-aware samplers to develop more efficient algorithms for solving bi- and multi-linear problems. Design of these samplers will provide new theoretical insights into properties of quadratic samplers, and will help address fundamental mathematical questions that can be of independent interest.  The samplers also facilitate the development of new inference strategies, and the proposed rigorous theoretical analysis of these algorithms is expected to fundamentally advance our current understanding of the limits of parameter estimation from compressed data. Finally, the ideas behind correlation-aware samplers have strong connections with problems in machine learning such as dictionary learning, and latent variable analysis, and they will foster future research advances in these areas."

To accomplish any meaningful grid-wide optimization task, the distribution system operator will need to precisely know the power consumed or generated at every node, the line and transformer parameters, and the topology of the grid. However currently, limited instrumentation and their sheer size render power distribution grids unobservable in general. To complement the smart metering and grid sensing infrastructure, the novel technique of grid probing is introduced here. Grid probing can be accomplished by commanding smart inverters residing at a subset of nodes to intentionally yet instantaneously perturb their power injections. Actuating the networked physical system and subsequently sensing the incurred voltages at metered nodes can unveil non-metered loads and network topologies. The original and potentially transformative idea of engaging smart inverters outside their intended control functionality pioneers new grid data analytics. This program goes beyond probing and maps the observability limits by processing smart meter data too. Contemporary optimization schemes together with their real-time and decentralized variants will deal with streaming and spatially incomplete voltage and power injection data collected at large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.<br/><br/>On the broader impact, this program lies at the nexus of power systems, nonlinear system identification, and statistical learning; advances our understanding of unique patterns in grid data; and discovers novel uses for inverters in grid monitoring and control. Enhancing situational awareness in distribution grids benefits society by enabling the efficient and reliable integration of distributed renewable energy, electric vehicles, and customer participation. The expected benefits to industry are cutting-edge grid analytics solutions, advanced asset management, and value added for inverters and smart meters. The proposed activities bring about a potentially transformative paradigm for grid data processing, neatly integrated with educational and outreach objectives. The program reaches pre-college female students through hands-on learning activities and collaborative app-based games on electric grids. It also involves undergraduate research and continues our outreach to undergraduate students through visits to residential communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a promising technique to increase the efficiency of the spectrum utilization, cognitive radio (CR) technique has the great potential to meet such a requirement by allowing unlicensed users to coexist in licensed bands. In conventional CR systems, the spectrum sensing is performed at the beginning of each time slot before the data transmission. This unfortunately results in two major problems: 1) transmission time reduction due to sensing, and 2) sensing accuracy impairment due to data transmission. To tackle these problems, a new design for future CR is proposed by exploring the full-duplex (FD) techniques to achieve the simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission. The aim of this proposal is to transform the promising conceptual framework into the practical wireless network design by addressing a diverse set of transformative challenges such as protocol design and theoretical analysis. The educational plan will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students. Active student involvement is ensured via mentoring, research involvement, and participation in testbed development. Outreach events targeting high school students, particularly women and minority, will be organized. Broad dissemination is guaranteed via publications, tutorials, workshops, and online tools.<br/><br/>The proposed research aims at laying the foundations of FD CR networks via an interdisciplinary framework that synergistically marries concepts from signal processing, wireless communications, networking, and RF hardware design to yield several innovations: 1. With multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) FD radios, secondary users can simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum, and thus, significantly improve sensing performances and meanwhile increase data transmission efficiency. The research issue is using MIMO to jointly considering primary user receivers and FD self-interference. 2. Classic CR networks using listen-before-talk, while FD enable listen-and-talk, which can significantly improve the network performances. The research issues are to investigate the tradeoffs. 3. The classical multiple random access protocol is based on carrier sensing multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), while FD enables collision detection (CSMA/CD). The research issue is to analyze the performances under self interference. 4. The proposed FD network protocols will be tested using WARP boards equipped with MIMO technology."

These severely ill patients undergo multiple complex interventions at the same time, and care is so complex that they are extremely vulnerable to medical errors and adverse outcomes.  Critical care patients are the most heavily instrumented patients in the hospital. Physiological signals are collected using many different types of sensors. These sensor signals reflect the underlying dynamic, integrated physiological state of the patient and are thus highly complex and inter-related. The biggest challenge faced by critical care physicians is that the amount and complexity of these data push the limits of what they can cognitively assimilate and relate to the overall physiological status of their patients. They are confronted by Big Data at every moment, yet they must interpret and act on them quickly. They lack the tools to do this. In this project, a goal is to develop and apply a novel class of algorithms, known as optimal change-point detection algorithms, to the problem of detecting when a patients state changes from one clinical condition to another. The application of sophisticated algorithms to healthcare will not only transform treatment in critical care units, but will be brought to the classroom to undergraduate students minoring in Computational Medicine.<br/><br/>The research team plans to develop automated computational methods for processing physiological time series data from critical care patient sensors to quickly detect changes in clinical state. These methods will include; (i) improved selection of features that characterize patient state; (ii) optimal control algorithms to detect transitions of patient state based on these features. One innovation in the proposed approach is a re-formulated the state transition detection problem as an optimal change-point problem from the fields of controls-theory and Bayesian optimal sequential decision making. This in turn has enabled us to derive an optimal detector by first defining a cost function that reflects performance goals (e.g. maximize sensitivity, minimize false positives), and then developing the detection rule that minimizes this cost. The researchers have demonstrated that this approach decreases time to detection of epileptic seizure onset by 50% relative to other state of the art methods. Another innovation lies in how to compute features from physiological waveforms. The goal of proposed research is to determine if optimal-change point algorithms in conjunction with these new features applied to the analysis of multiple types of physiological time series data can support earlier detection of changes in the clinical conditions of patients in the critical care unit. A new course or course module that introduces statistical and mechanistic model estimation and simple early detection algorithms will be developed. This course will expose biomedical engineering students to experimental data, biophysical-based models, and statistical models of biological systems that have clinical relevance."

Real-time diagnostics/prognostics and predictive maintenance/control of Li-ion battery are essential for reliable and safe battery operation in a wide-range of battery-powered applications, from hybrid and electric vehicles (HEVs/EVs) and medical devices, to the emerging smart grid and all electric airplanes. The proposed platform enables a battery management system (BMS) to develop predictive maintenance/control of a Li-ion battery through concurrently analyzing degradation mechanisms and anticipating failure modes. Successful execution of this research will advance our understanding of how to extend life and prevent catastrophic failure of Li-ion batteries, and will potentially lead to development of battery-powered devices that are more durable and safer than current devices. This project will disseminate research findings to battery industry by demonstrating the platform with a Li-ion battery in an implantable application, through collaboration with a leading industry partner. The project will offer a wide range of education and outreach programs, including 1) incorporating research findings into the Reliability Engineering curriculum, 2) leveraging university research programs to attract undergraduate and K-12 students to engineering career, and 3) organizing paper sessions and panels on Design for Failure Prevention of Li-Ion Battery in major conferences. <br/><br/>To date, real-time diagnostics/prognostics of Li-ion battery has been exploited only empirically and largely in isolation with the underlying degradation mechanisms. This may be attributed to the lack of cognizance of the causal relationship between degradation mechanisms and failure modes. This project will bridge the gap between physical mechanisms and functional failures by creating a dynamic reliability assessment platform that facilitates a synergistic integration of physics-based modeling and sensor-based prognostics. The platform will allow for: 1) identification and quantitative analysis of multiple degradation mechanisms through online estimation of the degradation parameters; and 2) anticipation of the failure modes through online prediction of their remaining useful lives (RULs). The creation of the platform involves three research thrusts: 1) validation of multiphysics models, which updates multiphysics battery models using high precision charge-discharge cycling data; 2) training of health estimators, which adopts machine learning to quantitatively analyze multiple degradation mechanisms from a single measurement of charge curve; and 3) prognostics of failure modes, which leverages the quantitative degradation analysis for prediction of failure mode RULs. The platform provides the methods and tools needed to leverage prognostics and prognostics-informed predictive maintenance/control for achieving the failure prevention capability of BMS. Although this project focuses on the specific case of dynamically updating battery reliability with measured electrical data, the methodology will be applicable to other engineering cases in which measured data are used to dynamically update reliability estimates that support maintenance/control decision making."

One promising approach to solve this issue is to utilize optical rather than electrical signals to send and receive data, which can theoretically lead to much higher speed and lower power consumption. However, difficulties in integrating high-performance optical components onto silicon electronics have been hindering practical application of optical links to chip-scale data communications. Here, we propose an innovative yet feasible optical link architecture consisting of nanoscale transmitters and receivers on a silicon platform.  Relating the fascination of optoelectronics to its impact on carbon footprint of data centers will be the foundation of a new education and community involvement platform.  Already, the PI participates in several activities to broaden the impact of laboratory research to society including direct relationships with high-schools, on-campus teacher training and helping to organize UCLA students for community involvement.  In this case, the PI will (a) incorporate the findings of the proposed research into the UCLA curriculum (b) train and mentor high-school students through summer internships and student exchange programs, (c) form a targeted effort aimed at increasing community knowledge and participation through a high-school technology roadshow and campus visitations to create excitement for innovations in high-speed, energy-efficient optical links.<br/><br/>The research objective of this proposal is to develop nanophotonic optical links based on compact, energy-efficient, and directly integrated lasers and photodetectors as transmitters and receivers on silicon-on-insulator via selective-area epitaxy of III-V nanopillars. The proposed design is fundamentally different from other interconnects with externally bonded lasers, as both transmitters and receivers are monolithically aligned and simultaneously integrated on conventional silicon waveguides. The proposed optical links include electrically-driven nanopillar array lasers and single nanopillar photodetectors, which are engineered to achieve an energy-to-data ratio of <10 fJ/bit. For lasers, a one-dimensional photonic crystal cavity consisting of an array of nanopillars can achieve a high cavity quality factor of 19,000 and waveguide coupling efficiency of 60 % with a footprint of only 7.7  0.2 m2. Purcell enhancement from an ultra-small and high-Q cavity as well as an introduction of three-dimensional diffusion barriers from InGaAs/InP nanopillar heterostructures results in an internal quantum efficiency of 93 %. For detectors, nanopillar photodiodes combined with plasmonic field enhancement achieved by metal nanoslot couplers realize the efficiency far beyond the diffraction limit, resulting in a dark current of 1 pA at 10 V, a bandwidth of 3.4 GHz, and a noise-equivalent power of 1.5  10-13 W/Hz1/2.  The total power consumption is expected to be 6.3 fJ/bit assuming that these transceivers are linked by 3 cm-long waveguide, which is more than an order of magnitude reduced power consumption compared with the state-of-the-art optical interconnects. The proposed electrically injected nanoresonators and plasmonic light manipulation architectures on silicon not only enable ultra-compact and energy-efficient optical links, but also pave the way toward quantum computing, all-optical switching and memories, single-photon sources, and bio- and chemical sensors."

This is one of the fastest growing loads on the electric grid in the U.S. as well as worldwide, because of customers' soaring demands for online data and cloud computing. This rapid-increasing consumption significantly contributes to global carbon emissions. Therefore, updating the power delivery for data centers with improved efficiency is an important societal need. The goal of this project is to address this power consumption bottleneck by using a new power distribution and conversion architecture that is compact, scalable, ultra-efficient, low-heat, low-cost, and reliable. If successful, a wide application of the proposed system could result in more than 8.1 billion kWh or ~$810 million annual savings in electricity consumption for data centers in the U.S. alone. These savings would, in turn, reduce harmful greenhouse gas emission of ~1.3 million passenger cars from U.S. roads. The impact can be further amplified by adoptions of the proposed system and its sub-systems in other information technology applications, such as communication systems, automotive, high-performance portable devices, etc. The research will be conducted by graduate students and undergraduate students who will be equipped with the knowledge and skills in integrated power electronics and energy efficiency for future opportunities in both professional and educational development.

Employing new converter topologies that can efficiently support large conversion ratios, the architecture reduces the number of power conversion stages from the grid to core voltages from four or more to only two. The first stage, converting grid AC voltage to a DC bus voltage, electrically stack server boards in close proximity in a server rack to allow each of them to handle only a fraction of the input grid AC voltage, leading to ultra-high power conversion efficiency, low cost and high reliability. This first conversion stage also exploits a novel, experimentally validated smart-cable method that can significantly reduce on-board heat, leading to substantial thermal management cost reductions. For the second stage converting the DC bus to core voltages, the research team will explore a new direct-conversion hybrid DC-DC converter topology family to enable superior efficiency and power density at extremely large conversion ratios. The research plan includes design, fabrication, and verification of multiple new hybrid converter topologies, integrating different types of AC-DC and DC-DC hybrid converters, smart-cable solution design and implementation, system failure protection circuit implementation and test, system scaling for different specifications and applications, and benchmarking against existing solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a particularly relevant problem as batteries perform multiple tasks in each application (e.g. driving, recharging, grid services, etc.) which can contribute to its aging differently. Furthermore, batteries not only perform multiple tasks in a single application, but migrate to a second application as a second life battery. This CAREER proposal aims to understand battery aging dynamics as context-dependent and to provide a unified theory and modeling that can link context events and lives with cell and module aging events. This will benefit all battery applications and the emerging battery repurposing sector by providing tangible methods to improve battery testing, estimation and management. As educational components, this project will propose new hands-on distributed laboratory capabilities for undergraduate and graduate students to explore battery technologies in the context of grid and vehicle applications. Outreach includes hosting female Hispanic students through the Michigan College and University Partnership, and also participating in the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineering mentoring and conferences.<br/><br/>Batteries are subjected to highly uncertain scenarios depending on their context, present cell to module and pack variations due to its space and function distribution and different monitoring capabilities at different scales. This CAREER proposal will consider that these conditions are comparable to ecological systems, such as fishery, forestry, etc. and that battery lifetime and aging should tackle the multi-scale and multi-life problem under ecological approaches and methods. For this, testing methods will include low-cost large-scale distributed testing that will experimentally probe individuals and populations of batteries across context variations and different lives. Data from these tests will be used to develop probabilistic reasoning networks to link causality for battery aging and will provide the ability to establish monitoring and data needs across lives. To formulate the battery aging and life modeling, the proposal will focus on studying intraspecific trait variations (variations inside a species) that arise from battery aging. For this purpose, populations of batteries will be identified through the establishment of a patch hierarchy to identify the structure and functional distribution of intraspecific trait per patch at the individual, sub-population and population level. The intraspecific traits will be modeled for each patch using individual-based, mixed models and integral projection models that are used in ecological systems to model population variations. These approaches will provide a probabilistic model across the population. However, as battery populations are monitored at different scales (pack and cells sparsely depending on the technology), the models will consider incomplete data availability and develop scaling ladders. These ladders will scale the intraspecific trait models from individuals to populations and vice versa to adapt to different data availability and mixed approaches. These models will be implemented in battery management systems to learn the traits models from scavenged data. Trait filters will also be formulated and deployed to identify and model internal and external factors that will determine the trait variations for each life. The models and ecology-based theory obtained will be experimentally validated through the large-scale population testing and real electric vehicle and grid-scale battery deployments."

The ever-increasing inter- and intra- chip communication bandwidth imposes a big challenge over decades: interconnect bottleneck. Existing electronic interconnect (EI) and optic interconnect (OI) cannot address the interconnect issue by their own. These result in the ""last centimeter"" dilemma in data links. THz unique spectrum, sitting between microwave and optic frequencies, allows it to enjoy advantages of both low cost, high reliability electronic processing and low loss, small size transmission channels, therefore holds great promises in interconnect area to bridge the ""last centimeter"" link. Ultimate interconnect solutions mandate high energy efficiency, high bandwidth density, high reliability, low cost, as well as a fast adaptability and scaling capability with process advancements. To address this multi-dimension challenge, the PI proposes THz Interconnect research, including the investigation of TI theory, channel design, circuit implementation techniques and demonstration validation. Particularly, we will investigate three crucial enabling techniques: planar silicon process compatible channels and couplers, the high efficiency self-oscillating harmonic power amplifier based transmitter, and the high sensitivity receiver. THz interconnect system architecture and fundamental performance limits given practical circuit/system constraints, and TI scalability with process advancements will also be investigated. To the PI's knowledge, this will be the first time to investigate THz Interconnect compatible with mainstream silicon technologies. THz interconnect theory discovers the understanding of the bandwidth density and energy efficiency limits of the interconnect, and leads to evolving TI architectures that scale performance with technologies to ultimately close the interconnect gap. If successful, THz Interconnect will provide orders of magnitude better bandwidth density and energy efficiency than existing interconnects to ultimately address the last centimeter interconnect issue. <br/>Broader Impacts: THz interconnect development opens a new, high potential application for the under-utilized THz spectrum. The PI also envisions that the success of THz interconnect will enable new computer architectures to satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth requirement in the BIG DATA era. It will also save tremendous energy to not only bring significant economic impacts, but also mitigate global warming problems. THz interconnect will form a killer application for the under-utilized THz spectrum to further motivate THz advancements and impact our lives and societies in larger and deeper scales. The PI will also integrate research with education and outreach programs, and broadly disseminate the research results through publications."

This project considers the design and analysis of advanced error-correcting codes that mitigate transmission errors and provide reliable communication for internet traffic. <br/><br/>The design and implementation of advanced channel coding techniques at extremely high data rates is very challenging due to hardware constraints. This is exacerbated by the fact that the desired code rates are high (e.g., greater than 0.8) and the target bit error rates are extremely low (e.g., on the order of 1e-15 or 10^{-15}). These constraints call for innovative ideas for the design of advanced channel coding techniques and cross-disciplinary interaction between researchers who focus on algorithm design and researchers who specialize in hardware implementation. The goal of this research effort is to design practical codes and decoders that provide large coding gains and can be implemented at speeds scaling to 10 Tera bits per second in the future. The transformative nature of the project lies in the fact that several novel classes of codes and computationally-efficient decoders will be designed and analyzed. Specifically, we will consider the following three topics - (i) the design and analysis of novel classes of spatially-coupled algebraic codes, symmetric product codes and spatially-coupled convolutional codes that have the potential to deliver large coding gains, (ii) the design and analysis of message-passing decoding algorithms for these codes that can achieve extremely high throughput with moderate hardware resources, and (iii) the design of codes and computationally-efficient soft-decision decoding algorithms that exploit the availability of soft information from the channel. Another important aspect of this project is the design methodology which leverages the close interaction between algorithm design and hardware implementation which will result in the implementation of codes and decoders on field programmable gate arrays.

Drug resistance is one of the greatest impediments to treating both cancer and infectious disease and has been identified as one of the greatest public health threats of the next several decades. The proposed miniaturized instrument can be utilized for rapidly screening cancer patients for drug resistance and identifying the key molecular players involved and selecting optimal cancer treatment drugs. In this work, a microfluidics/electronic/data-driven crosscut approach is proposed to enable a rapid technology that can identify drug resistant cells using machine learning and examine the key protein pathways resulting in resistance using a label-free sensing array. The proposed platform is adaptive and reconfigures itself to assay the relevant proteins on-demand and avoids a resource-hungry brute force approach. This interdisciplinary project will engage and train both graduate and undergraduate students in various areas. The PI will also engage K-12 students through outreach workshops, local industry through educational lectures, and the general public through development of an online course, resulting in broad dissemination of knowledge. <br/><br/>A new class of data-driven biosensors will be developed that can adapt themselves on-demand to detect and treat multidrug resistant cancers. Treatment of multi-drug resistance in cancer is difficult using static analysis platforms because of the rapid ability of tumor sub-clones to mutate and become insusceptible to a chemotherapeutic drug, thus an adaptive approach can be more efficient. An all-electronic platform will be developed for rapidly sorting drug resistant cells and adaptively analyzing the molecular pathways involved in resistance using a reconfigurable array of sensors. The analyzer will iteratively detect drug resistant cells using reconfigurable impedance cytometry in conjunction with machine learning, then sort them using dielectrophoresis (DEP), analyze them using a reconfigurable array of label-free protein sensors, and then use a machine learning classifier to further sub-type the drug resistant cells to select a drug combination to test in the subsequent iteration. An integrated closed-loop feedback system will be fabricated and characterized for sorting drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, and analyze differential expression of potential drug-resistance pathways iteratively against key drug candidates.

The transition from one to several (typically two to four) antennas at both ends of the wireless link, known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), was a key enabler for the growing data rates during the last decade. However, as the demands for data rates on the network are expected to increase by more than 1000x by 2020, novel transmission technologies beyond small-scale MIMO become necessary. This project will leverage recent theoretical results in massive MIMO, which promise that the use of hundreds of antennas at the base-station will enable orders-of-magnitude higher data rates than conventional small-scale MIMO systems. Since existing algorithms and current integrated circuit architectures are unable to sustain the excessive complexity caused by the massive amount of received data streams, this project will jointly consider algorithms and efficient (in terms of cost and power) computing architectures. The project will analyze system trade-offs to develop low-complexity algorithms and corresponding integrated circuits that will enable the capabilities of massive MIMO. Another goal of this project in terms of broader impact is to develop open-access education materials and semester-length courses on algorithms and hardware design aspects of massive MIMO. <br/><br/>The computational complexity of existing data detection, multi-user interference suppression (pre-coding), and impairment-compensation algorithms in systems relying on massive MIMO grows super-linear in the number of base-station antennas. Thus, the associated computational complexity prevents the use of these algorithms in wireless systems having hundreds of antennas. To enable massive MIMO in future systems, the project develops a set of novel computationally efficient algorithms for detection, pre-coding, and impairment compensation that can be implemented in dedicated digital very-large scale integration (VLSI) circuits at low complexity and power. The proposed methods will rely on approximate algorithms using series expansions and convex optimization, which approaches optimal performance as the number of base-station antennas increases. Furthermore, novel antenna-selection schemes are developed with the goal of reducing the complexity and hardware costs incurred by the presence of hundreds of base-station antennas. In addition to theoretical analyses and algorithm development, experimental evaluation of the developed baseband accelerators will be conducted on early-stage academic prototype platforms. The results of this evaluation will be used to assess the performance, complexity, and power consumption of the developed algorithm accelerator designs in realistic environments and to identify both the potential capabilities and limits of massive MIMO systems."

In addition, the next generation of transportation systems will include connected vehicles, connected infrastructure, and increased automation, and these advances must coexist with legacy technology into the foreseeable future. Accommodating these rapidly developing advancements requires smarter and more efficient use of existing infrastructure with guarantees of performance, safety, and interoperability.  The goal of this project is to develop fundamental theory and domain-driven techniques for controlling traffic flow in large-scale transportation networks. Recent advances in inexpensive sensors, wireless technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) enable real-time connectivity of vehicles and infrastructure that offers abundant data and unprecedented opportunities for efficient and   optimized transportation systems.  The main technical goal is to develop techniques and algorithms that are correct-by-design, ensuring that these transportation systems satisfy required operating specifications. In pursuit of this goal, the project will first develop models of traffic flow from rich data streams and then will leverage these models to enable scalable control approaches. In addition, this project will integrate an ambitious education plan that includes a redesigned introductory course in control theory for undergraduates. The course will be restructured to focus on modern challenges in control, culminating in a Control Grand Challenge design competition in which students will design a controller for an autonomous, scale-model car and then compete with their design. <br/><br/>To achieve systems that satisfy the rich design specifications demanded of traffic networks, the project will especially focus on bringing powerful techniques from formal methods for verification and synthesis to large-scale physical networks. These formal methods were originally developed for specifying and verifying the correct behavior of software and hardware systems, and an important research objective now is to ensure these approaches are scalable, adaptable, and reliable when applied to physical control systems. The project will focus on the following objectives: i) Develop theory and models for the dynamic behavior of traffic networks that captures domain-specific phenomena such as congestion propagation, ii) Determine how traffic flow dynamics will change as vehicles are increasingly equipped with autonomous capabilities, iii) Identify and exploit intrinsic structure in traffic flow networks to enable scalable formal methods for verification and synthesis, and iv) Use data available through industry collaborations to develop probabilistically correct control of traffic flow networks. These objectives address a growing need for systematic guarantees of performance in traffic networks as the increasing complexity and interdependence of transportation systems renders ad hoc approaches insufficient. The research activities of this project will use real traffic data available through ongoing collaborations with industry. An expected outcome of this project is a suite of scalable algorithms that will be tested on a pilot traffic network available through this collaboration. In addition, the project will establish foundational theory applicable outside the traffic domain."

These innovations are currently not satisfactory to address the significantly enhanced data rate needs for future generations (5G and beyond) of wireless communication systems. Consequently, wider frequency bandwidths available at mm-Wave bands (above 10GHz) have recently attracted a strong interest from the wireless community to be able to serve the future data rate demands. Therefore, in this project, the aim is to enhance the capacity and the data rate of wireless communication systems based on the wireless channel control phenomenon by investigating the use of spatial (i.e. position) adaptation of smart antenna arrays. At mm-Wave bands, position adaptations on the order of a few centimeters can practically be realized within compact devices and yet provide new wireless channel opportunities and interference mitigation. The preliminary studies demonstrate that wireless channel opportunities achieved through such spatial adaptations can improve the wireless system capacity beyond a factor of 2.5 to 5. Hence, the results of this project are expected to be transformative in adaptive wireless communications area and the resulting knowledge base is expected to have effects on commercial, emergency, and military communication domains. Immediate tangible outcome of this project will be a system level test bed that will provide results, outcomes, and design guidelines to prospective designers within academia and industry. The proposed activity will also lead to improve the curriculums through developing lab experiments and test beds. Efforts will be made to incite the participation of the minority students via seminars, technology fairs, and specialized events. Broad dissemination is ensured via conference and journal publications, workshops, and tutorials. Specialized outreach sessions will be organized at local high schools and community colleges to expose and attract students, particularly minorities to STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This proposal introduces a novel wireless system adaptation strategy based on repositioning of mm-Wave antenna arrays during the system operation to control the wireless channel gain. The recent developments in the areas of microfluidic based reconfigurable RF devices and multi-dimensional (i.e. frequency, time, and spatial domains) dynamic spectrum access techniques are jointly investigated, for the first time, to significantly enhance wireless communication system performance. Beam and position adaptable antennas at the transmitter and receiver are used to control the multipath channel characteristics so that a favorable effective channel response for the communication link can be obtained.  Unlike the on-going research efforts that focus on mm-Wave wireless systems harnessing beam-steering capability, the proposed system envisions a paradigm shift in the physical layer by controlling the wireless channel using a combination of the beam-steering and position adapting functionalities. Position adaptation is planned to be carried out in a compact, efficient, and high precision device by introducing microfluidically reconfigurable feed networks. The proposed unusual combination of beam-steering and position reconfiguration generates a need for this proposed effort to investigate and revise the long-time established channel estimation, tracking, prediction, and compensation techniques.

For example, predictions by the cellular industry state that the global per-capita information usage will grow from 15 GB in 2014 to around 37 GB in 2019. Without significant technological advances to increase its capacity, the existing telecommunications infrastructure will be unable to support this vast data increase. The advent of modern error-correcting codes, such as turbo codes, low-density parity-check codes, and polar codes, has represented a quantum leap in error-correcting performance for wireless systems, allowing reliable communication of information over noisy channels at data rates close to capacity. However, improvements in this direction have been mostly limited to the point-to-point case, and maximizing gains for the point-to-point channel setup will not be sufficient to satisfy the high throughput and low delay requirements of emerging communication systems, in particular of 5G cellular systems and beyond. This project aims to tackle these issues by extending coding schemes to the wireless network setting, thereby yielding additional throughput gains beyond the classical point-to-point case. The proposed research promises to provide a significant transformative impact on many critical applications employing reliable networked wireless communication, for example in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, finance, and so on.<br/><br/>In this project, a comprehensive framework of practical low-complexity, low-latency, capacity-approaching sparse graph codes is proposed.

The megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz) bands currently used for RFID will soon become congested, especially considering the interference from simultaneous interrogations of many co-located RFID devices and the limited bandwidth allocated for RFID. In addition, limited by their off-chip components for wireless powering and data transmission, current RFID devices have relatively high packaging cost and large form factor. The low available power also prevents the usage of high-security algorithms and hardware on the RFID devices. All these problems have hindered the effectiveness and application of the technology in areas like authentications of medicines, semiconductor chips, banknotes, etc. This project will apply low-terahertz (~0.3 THz in this project) wireless powering and back-scattering circuit techniques to explore a new electromagnetic spectrum for future RFID tagging. The 1000 times larger bandwidth and the highly-collimated downlink and uplink beams will accommodate orders of magnitude more tags than what we have today. The new THz RFID device realized on a semiconductor chip will also have a package-less ultra-small form, leading to dramatic cost reduction and wide range of applications. The proposal will also develop energy-efficient authentication hardware and algorithms for the proposed THz RFID chip to secure the storage and transmission of sensitive data related to, for example, financial and biometric information. The proposed research will be tightly integrated with a few outreach activities, including a SuperUROP undergraduate research program, a ""Tagging the World"" lecture series, an internship through MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP), a career workshop at MIT Rising Star, and a few ""T-Ray Lab Day"" events for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project will utilize custom-designed, ultra-high-speed Schottky-barrier diodes to perform practical THz power rectification, with an expected THz-to-DC conversion efficiency of up to 50%. A novel antenna array, which is co-designed with the diode and adopts a multi-functional electromagnetics methodology, will also be developed to simultaneously perform large-aperture wireless powering and back-scattering-based data communication. In addition, low-energy authentication protocols and hardware will be applied to the system. In particular, the RFID chip will be equipped with a side-channel resistant elliptic curve processor, which uses dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) to reduce its DC power to microwatt level. Novel CMOS-compatible memory for secret-key storage, as well as beam-steering of the RFID tag output wave for anti-eavesdropping, will also be implemented in the chip. The package-less and battery-less RFID chip is expected to have a volume smaller than one tenth of a cubic millimeter. Lastly, using high-speed indium phosphide (InP) heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), the project will innovate a THz interrogator transceiver to pair with the RFID chips. With a scalable array architecture and high-versatility transceiver front-end circuit units, the interrogator will be able to radiate more than 100 mW of power with highly focused beam. The proposed approach will advance the utilization efficiency and diversity of electromagnetic spectrum, as well as the end-to-end solutions for secured wireless data authentication. The project will also generate new design methodologies for both high-frequency and high-security integrated circuits, especially under power-constrained conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting electromagnetic spectrum below 60-GHz has become extremely overcrowded, even with advanced spectrum-efficient modulation formats and spatially diverse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. At present, the sub-millimeter-wave (sub-mm-Wave) electromagnetic spectrum between 300 GHz and 850 GHz is largely unassigned and provides a unique opportunity for more efficient utilization. This will avoid further crowding the currently heavily used spectrum and significantly enhance data rates to tens of Gb/s. This project seeks to demonstrate such a fundamentally new platform towards spectral-efficient and energy-efficient wireless communications with embedded security. Due to the inherent atmospheric attenuation, the sub-mm-Wave communication distance has been limited to within 50 m. Thus, this project proposes network configurations of sub-mm-Wave point-to-point links to enable secured spatial coverage over longer distances and larger areas. There are two distinct differences of the sub-mm-Wave links compared to traditional wireless networks: the directivity of the sub-mm-Wave links and the possibility for a transmitter to connect to multiple receivers through adaptive electronic beam-steering and beam-forming. The beam-forming with narrow beam-width removes broadcasting and avoids interference, enabling much simpler network operation to approach the theoretical upper limits of network information capacity. The project seeks to demonstrate the modular sub-mm-Wave link hardware to achieve the above goal. The proposed research will be complemented with an integrated education and outreach program. This includes diversity recruitment, mentoring and retention, hands-on curriculum development, minority high-school and undergraduate training, and public outreach. The cross-layer scientific and education provides a new platform at the interface of hardware, software, and networks in next-generation wireless communication networks.<br/><br/>This project will develop a spectrally dense, high-data-rate, 650-GHz photonic wireless communications platform in a diamond mesh network, while explicitly addressing network security and energy efficiency in the architecture. The collaborative research spans across the physical layer, the network layer, and the software layer, addressing cross-layer issues in the fundamental architecture. The proposed research consists of three thrust areas. In Thrust I, the project will examine a modular photonic sub-mm-Wave link, based on a chip-scale photomixer driven by an optical frequency comb recently developed by the team. This enables high-power spectrally dense, 80 Gb/s sub-mm-Wave transmission. In Thrust II, the project will examine a photonic sub-mm-Wave 80 Gb/s testbed, implemented with an adaptive smart antenna array. Beam-steering and beam-forming will enable simultaneously a directional line-of-sight (LoS) link and a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) link, with the former establishing a spectrally efficient channel with less inter-symbol and inter-channel interference. The latter mitigates medium non-idealities such as interference, shadowing, and multi-path effects. In Thrust III, the project will study the capacity of sub-mm-Wave communication networks and explore the design of near-optimal efficient and secure algorithms. Enabled by the intrinsic directivity and beam-forming capabilities of our sub-mm-Wave link, the project will advance the possibility of unconditional security in the wireless backhaul network through physical layer security algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, predictions by the cellular industry state that the global per-capita information usage will grow from 15 GB in 2014 to around 37 GB in 2019. Without significant technological advances to increase its capacity, the existing telecommunications infrastructure will be unable to support this vast data increase. The advent of modern error-correcting codes, such as turbo codes, low-density parity-check codes, and polar codes, has represented a quantum leap in error-correcting performance for wireless systems, allowing reliable communication of information over noisy channels at data rates close to capacity. However, improvements in this direction have been mostly limited to the point-to-point case, and maximizing gains for the point-to-point channel setup will not be sufficient to satisfy the high throughput and low delay requirements of emerging communication systems, in particular of 5G cellular systems and beyond. This project aims to tackle these issues by extending coding schemes to the wireless network setting, thereby yielding additional throughput gains beyond the classical point-to-point case. The proposed research promises to provide a significant transformative impact on many critical applications employing reliable networked wireless communication, for example in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, finance, and so on.<br/><br/>In this project, a comprehensive framework of practical low-complexity, low-latency, capacity-approaching sparse graph codes is proposed.

Second, such network monitoring results are often needed to serve multiple purposes, to answer queries about different aspects of the network behaviors, to understand at a microscopic level of how the interconnected components interact. The goal of this project is to apply a new geometric approach of feature selection to reduce the high dimensional network measurement data into a much more manageable lower dimensional feature space, where efficient algorithms can be applied to understand network behaviors, identify suspicious activities, and optimize network resource allocations. The success of this project can lead to new interfaces to network status, better network operations, as well as new approaches to improve cyber security. <br/><br/>The main technical contribution of this project is based on a novel formulation of ""universal feature selection"", with the goal of finding features from the data that is universally informative to a collection of possible queries. A geometric-based analysis method is developed to give quantitative solutions to such problems. Comparing to the tradition information metrics that only quantify the volume of information, the geometric framework helps to give rise to a new notion of ""information vector"", which can be used to quantitatively measure the meaning of a piece of information and the relevance to a specific query. Feature selection based on such a geometric structure can thus connect the information processing operations to these new information metrics, providing guidance of optimization and theoretical guarantees of the performance.

The processing demands of this data are driving the continued need for greater computational power, in domains including big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality, serving technologies including personal, medical, research, engineering, finance, and weather prediction.  As ""Moore's Law"" of the semiconductor industry - which has guaranteed continued advance of computing power in the last 50 years - has ground to a halt in the past decade, new computational paradigms are being sought to remedy this dire situation.  Quantum information technology is the new and ultimate frontier for signal processing and computing and leverages the unintuitive laws of our universe that hold on small scales.  50-100 qubit processors have been developed by Intel, IBM and Google, but quantum optical networks, needed to network them into ""quantum data centers"" in a way similar to their conventional analogues, are missing.  This project aims to fill that gap by developing a new electronic-photonic chip technology and framework to allow creation of electronic-photonic quantum systems-on-chip (epQSoCs).  epQSoCs combine light, electronic circuits, and quantum functions on a single microchip that can provide a widely deployable technology platform for quantum networks.  The project will combine interdisciplinary expertise in photonics, electronic systems, and quantum communications to demonstrate the first epQSoC.  A single-chip, ""wall-plug"" source of quantum correlated photon pairs, this epQSoC is a fundamental building block for more complex epQSoCs and for quantum networks.  By integrating several components and novel capabilities never previously integrated in a single chip, this source will provide new levels of photon-pair source performance.  The interdisciplinary project team will also educate a new generation of engineers in this emerging new technology area to foster innovation, excellence and global leadership in the United States.<br/><br/>A ""wall plug"" single-chip source of photon pairs, a fundamental building block of most quantum photonic systems, will be demonstrated having a high efficiency, rate and reconfigurability to produce factorizable quantum states and allow heralding of pure single photons.  No such integrated device exists despite the fact that a rack-mounted fiber-nonlinearity-based source of this kind for lab use has been commercialized for almost a decade. The proposed project aims to change the quantum technology landscape with the demonstration of a fully integrated single-chip quantum pair source system. The chip photonic circuit will contain photonic elements for pre- and post-source linear pump filtering, a resonant nonlinear pair generator, pump pulse carver to allow active matching of the pump pulse length to the source's resonant bandwidth in order to control the produced photons joint spectral intensity (to yield a factorizable or other engineered biphoton states), and an ultra-low loss interface to fiber. The proposed approach addresses a number of challenges that arise in integration, on-chip filtering, and real-time control. In addition to standalone operation, the pair source will be the first implementation of an electronic-photonic quantum system-on-chip (epQSoC) and a key building block for more complex integrated quantum systems.  The proposed epQSoCs will be implemented in a commercial 45nm CMOS electronic-photonic platform (with potential for integrating single-photon detectors on chip as well).<br/> The project will create the technology framework (block libraries, tools, models and design methodologies) for low-cost, rapid innovation and design of sophisticated epQSoCs.

The outcomes of the research are expected to give a significant boost to the channel capacity in a single fiber without the need of fiber infrastructure upgrade, hence pushing the capacity limit of existing optical fiber networks.

Current applications mostly focus on utilizing the two independent polarization channels to double the data transmission capacity of a single-mode optical fiber. The goal of this research is to significantly increase the capacity by exploiting the very large number of possible states of polarization (SOPs) to encode information. This is accomplished by maximizing the number of distinguishable SOPs with the use of optimal quantum receivers for SOP estimation and a machine-learning-based optimal polarization modulation format in an integrated fiber optic communication system. The research will explore this capacity in single-mode fibers through theory as well as experimental results. Research tasks will include the design of optimal polarization receivers for the optical communication link, the combination of polarization shift keying (POLSK) with phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), deep neural network-based optimizations for the polarization modulation format, and an experimental testbed incorporating the optimal modulation and detection for the entire optical link composed of the transmitter, channel and receiver.

By employing electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging data from the auditory systems of ferrets and mice, the proposed modeling and estimation framework will be used to investigate several fundamental questions pertaining to the functional organization of the networks involved in auditory processing. The project is expected to impact technology by providing signal processing solutions to be used in neural control systems. The research is also integrated with education and outreach activities including high school level workshops, undergraduate involvement, and course development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria are consistent with projected increases in natural disasters, both in terms of frequency and intensity. This study investigates the aftermaths of the hurricanes and reconstructs the power grid failure history through forensic analytics.

A website will be developed to host the project and will reside in a secured server system. The team will upload the data to the secured website and use the collected data and storm event history to generate the geospatial-temporal integrated analysis within a GIS framework. This work will investigate failure patterns and failure history in order to strategically assess risk based on vulnerabilities and critical importance of the existing grid systems.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Hurricanes Irma and Maria have the interest of national and international scientific and engineering organizations and the general public. The critical question raised by a concerned public are such storms examples of future extreme events and how can the power delivery systems be more resilient.  The collected data will also help coastal utilities evaluate the viability of building a resilient grid system that resists extreme weather.  The analysis of the data gathered by this forensic study will allow an evaluation of the effects on the grid in well-developed areas compared to less-developed areas.

The ferroelectric effect, a switchable polarization charge, which occurs in certain materials combined together with an advanced memory device concept provides a promising approach to achieve a transformative improvement in non-volatile memory technologies.  The discovery of ferroelectricity in lead-free hafnium dioxide thin films in 2011 offers a sustainable route for further scaling of the next generation of manufacturable, low-power, and high performance nonvolatile memory ferroelectric devices.  In this project, an advanced device concept known as a ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) will be investigated using the ferroelectric hafnium dioxide thin films.  In a FTJ, the tunneling electroresistance is switched between a low and a high value by switching the polarization direction (internal electric field).  Numerical studies indicate that the hafnium dioxide-based FTJ can yield substantial reductions in the amount of power required to store data.  In a two-pronged approach, experiments and numerical modeling will be conducted to test the numerical models and to advance the fundamental understanding and state-of-the-art in nonvolatile FTJ memory technology using hafnium dioxide thin films.<br/><br/>The overriding goal of the project is to understand and tailor the atomic structure of the ferroelectric phase of hafnium dioxide in thin film capacitors, thereby enabling complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible FTJs.  A comprehensive and methodological study evaluating the deposition and processing conditions of hafnium dioxide-based thin film ferroelectrics will provide critical insights about the effect of impurities, dopants, film growth and annealing temperatures, and interfacial stability that influence the ferroelectric properties. These studies will pave the way toward investigating the physical limits of ferroelectric hafnium dioxide-based films and the realization of CMOS-compatible and scalable FTJs.  Recent studies on macroscopic variation of the dopants concentration as well as the atomic layering of mixed mono-layers of dopants in hafnium dioxide suggest extreme possibilities in fine-tuning ferroelectric properties of doped hafnium dioxide thin films. The discovery of CMOS compatible and scalable ferroelectric hafnium dioxide offers a unique opportunity to investigate the performance potential of CMOS compatible hafnium dioxide FTJ through carefully coupled theoretical and experimental investigation. Numerical studies indicate that ferroelectric hafnium dioxide FTJ on germanium substrate can approach sub-femto Joule/bit for a feature size of F=20nm. This ability to experimentally tune the characteristics of the ferroelectric hafnium dioxide thin films of varying thickness coupled with advanced ab initio material and device simulation enable this investigation of the performance limits of FTJ devices employing ferroelectric hafnium dioxide on germanium."

In addition to well-established renewables like wind, solar and traditional hydropower, marine currents have the potential to diversify and significantly strengthen the global energy portfolio. This project will conduct basic research focused on extracting electrical power from marine currents using ocean current turbines. These turbines will operate near the sea surface in major offshore currents and will be interconnected in arrays. The project will address fundamental issues related to coordinated, safe, reliable, and robust operation of these turbines within the array for maximum energy production. Networked electrical interconnections between devices and energy storage will also be investigated, with a focus on efficiently feeding electrical power from an array of turbines to an onshore grid. A diverse population of Faculty and student researchers will contribute to this project, creating a heterogeneous network of scholars that will improve the infrastructure for research and education. Important findings from this project will be integrated with active education and outreach programs at Virginia Tech, the University of New Orleans, and Florida Atlantic University which regularly share research outcomes with the public through presentations, workshops, the web, conferences, and summer camp activities. Broader scientific and technological impacts are expected in the energy sector, ocean engineering and technology, marine vehicles and devices, as well as autonomy and control systems.<br/><br/>Ocean current turbines will be interconnected in arrays through a local feed-in which sends generated power to a grid. These devices will be affected by flow perturbations such as current shear, turbulence, marine waves, as well as the shear and turbulence generated by neighboring turbines. The overall project goal is to ensure autonomous, reliable and robust coordinated operation of these turbines for maximum energy production and proper power conditioning in the presence of realistic perturbations and sub-system failures. For this purpose fault tolerant flight control, supervisory switching control to manage sub-system failures, formation and network control for ocean current turbine farms with energy storage will be investigated. Novel control systems, which include active blade pitch angle control by leveraging helicopter flight control technology and modern multivariable constrained control techniques will be developed.

In a vast and mixed urban/rural country such as the United States, providing high-speed broadband data access through the wired infrastructure can be costly. On the other hand, wireless can cover large areas and reach a large number of people very effectively. In addition, wireless is the preferred medium through which we connect to the Internet and enjoy a whole wealth of services such as entertainment, education, healthcare, e-commerce, social networking, and remote working. In this context, the ability to handle the predicted dramatic increase of demand for wireless data has become crucial not only for the wireless industry but, more in general, for the growth of our economy. While wireless connectivity has significantly improved over the past few decades, it is quite behind the theoretical and technological achievable limits and it cannot address future demand. With this in mind, this project develops an innovative multi-tier hierarchical infrastructure for next-generation cellular networks with densely deployed base stations, along with a set of well-integrated cross-layer design techniques for interference management and system optimization. This proposed approach may considerably improve the rate performance and user capacity, and is promising in bridging the gap between theory and practice for broadband wireless access. <br/><br/>To support the drastically increased mobile data traffic in wireless broadband services, this work focuses on a systematic cross-layer system optimization approach that relies on three major pillars: 1) at the physical layer, base stations with massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems are used; 2) at the wireless network architecture level, a multi-tier heterogeneous network approach is selected, achieving unprecedented spatial spectrum reuse; 3) at the cross-layer optimization level, a holistic network utility maximization approach is proposed, that systematically obtains layered protocol architectures from the structure of the global optimization solution. In relation to the above pillars, the fundamental challenges that will be addressed in this project are: 1) the design of integrated and power-efficient reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output front-end antenna systems based on the concept of hybrid beamforming, i.e., on the optimal splitting of multiuser precoding and inter-cell interference management functions between digital baseband processing and analog radio frequency beamforming; 2) the design of hybrid beamforming schemes that exploit long-term channel statistics for inter-cell coordinated interference management, and instantaneous channel state information to achieve spatial multiplexing gain in each cell; 3) a user partitioning and scheduling approach based on clustering the user space according to quality of experience requirements, channel statistics and mobility, assigning network utility functions to the different user groups, solving the combined  network utility maximization problem and systematically deriving a layered protocol architecture from the structural properties of the optimization solution. In addition, the work will significantly extend current mathematical performance analysis of wireless networks, based on advanced tools from stochastic geometry and random matrix theory, in order to assess quantitatively the performance gains over current technology of the proposed approach. Last, small-scale experiments will be conducted with software-defined radios equipped with the front end that will be developed."

Developing new methods for improving our understanding of hidden mechanisms behind power system vulnerability is, hence, a critical step towards protecting economic stability and human life and facilitating societal resilience on a broad front. Complex networks offer a natural representation of power systems, where generators and substations are specified as vertices and electric lines are sketched as edges.  There are generally two main approaches to the analysis of power systems using complex networks. The first approach is based on purely topological properties of a grid network, and the second hybrid approach aims to incorporate electrical engineering concepts, e.g. impedance, maximum power, etc., into the complex network analysis, which typically results in a representation of a grid as a weighted directed graph. Both approaches provide important complementary insights into hidden mechanisms behind functionality of power systems, and neither approach can be viewed as a universally preferred method.  This project aims to introduce novel concepts of topological data analysis into studies of power systems that will capitalize on strengths of both complex network tools and electrical engineering concepts. The project will facilitate our understanding of power-flow grids and, more generally, of critical infrastructure functionality, reliability, and robustness, at a local level.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel procedures for more systematic, data-driven<br/>and geometrically enhanced inference for power flow grids, while accounting both for dynamic higher order topological structure and for electrical engineering characteristics of a grid network, and to study the utility of persistent homologies in amplifying our understanding of hidden mechanisms behind power grid resilience in a broad range of real-world scenarios.

To meet this data challenge, massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system technology has recently been proposed where the base station employs a large number of antennas, allowing many users to be served simultaneously. It is regarded as one of the key enablers of future 5G wireless systems. While recent prototypes have demonstrated its feasibility, many significant research challenges remain to be addressed before massive MIMO can be deployed. Successful operation of massive MIMO depends critically on knowledge of the channel state information between the base station and the end users. In practice this would be acquired during the training phase where the users send individual pilot signals to the base station. This phase is challenging due to a large number of end users which lead to pilot reuse causing pilot contamination, and due to vulnerability to attacks by malicious eavesdroppers who may spoof legitimate users by transmitting identical pilot signals. This project is focused on methods to detect and defend against pilot contamination attacks.<br/> <br/>     Innovative approaches to detect and defend against pilot contamination attacks from active eavesdroppers as well as from spoofing relays are investigated in this research. A key transformative idea introduced is that of self-contamination of pilot sequences by legitimate users to facilitate detection of active eavesdroppers. This project explores various ramifications of this idea in the context of the following research thrusts. (1) Detection of pilot contamination attacks by active eavesdroppers:  Assuming the knowledge of the set of training sequences (and nothing else), can one detect whether one or more training sequences are under attack. Source enumeration methods based on data correlation function are being exploited. (2) Joint acquisition of channel state information for both legitimate users and eavesdroppers to facilitate effective beamforming designs to enhance reception at legitimate users while degrading reception at eavesdroppers. (3) Detection and mitigation of active eavesdropping via spoofing relay attack where a spoofing relay operates in a full-duplex mode and simply amplifies and forwards the signal from a legitimate user to the base station in a time-division duplex uplink operation."

Rapid advances are needed to aid a dwindling agricultural workforce, increase crop yield to sustain the growing population, and provide targeted crop care to limit the need for broad pesticide treatments. These challenges may well be addressed by autonomous mobile robots and sensor networks; unfortunately, agricultural landscapes represent vast, complicated, and dynamic environments that complicate long term operation. In contrast, social insects are capable of robust sustained operation in unpredictable environments far beyond what is possible with state-of-the-art artificial systems. Colonies of honey bees are of particular interest in this project, because they are the premiere agricultural pollinator bringing in over $150 billion annually. The U.S. has an estimated 2.4 million colonies, many of whom travel the country every summer to help pollinate monocrops such as almond and corn. A colony causes pollination by dispatching tens of thousands of scouts and foragers to survey and sample kilometer-wide areas around their hive. Thus, the colony as a whole accumulates vast information about the local agricultural landscape, bloom and dearth -- information that would be very informative if available to farmers and beekeepers. <br/> <br/>This project will leverage social insects as environmental indicators by piggybacking on their naturally existing capabilities. It involves sensors to record where bees focus their foraging activity, and mechanisms to stimulate additional foragers. This project will impact: 1) ultra-low power electronics and sensing, 2) probabilistic inference from large scale distributed data sources, 3) feedback control of biohybrid systems, and 4) gains to apiculture and entomology. The proposed bio-hybrid technology may further inform models of how bees forage in natural versus cultivated areas, and may lead to new insights on design of agricultural multi-use landscapes for improved yield.  Overall, this research will improve engineers' understanding of Bio-Cyber Physical Systems able to monitor and affect the environment, and may be applicable to scenarios including search and rescue, detection of chemical spills, and targeted pollination.<br/> <br/>To harness the capabilities of a bee colony while still providing control and sensing, the proposed work specifically involves 1) novel submillimeter flight recorders with visual scene capture and analysis, thermal and mechanical sensors, a clock, storage, processing, photovoltaic chargers and short range communications; 2) algorithms and models to estimate foraging maps, relying on bee motion models and feature extraction, merging probability density functions of observed landmarks from thousands of flights; and 3) feedback control via a bee-mimicking shaker device to recruit foragers, in turn eliciting data collection and pollination, e.g. during brief spouts of bloom that would otherwise go unnoticed by the colony. This research represents a transformative step towards a new frontier in Bio-Cyber Physical Systems, improving upon the abilities of social insects to sense and interact with the physical world, while providing data acquisition and control on par with explicitly engineered systems."

However, with the increased reliance of grid operations on complex and actionable data flows, comes the substantial risk of cyber attacks on the physical system. By coordinating the manipulation of actionable data transfers from only a small number of remote sensing units (e.g. power meters, relay states, voltage sensors), a malicious adversary can mislead the system operator into taking corrective control actions with staggering economic and physical consequences. These include: (i) inefficient market outcomes based on sub-optimal dispatch of generation, (ii) manipulation of electricity market prices and financial instruments for profit gain, (iii) cascading failures in transmission networks, and (iv) physical damage to large generation and substation facilities. Broadly, the proposed research seeks to address the fundamental open research challenges associated with securing the electric power infrastructure and electricity markets against such malicious cyber attacks.<br/><br/>The various mechanisms through which data integrity attacks can manipulate the behavior of cyber-physical systems such as the power grid are not yet well understood, and effective countermeasures remain undeveloped.

However, due to its emerging nature, virtual/augmented reality immersive communication is presently limited to gaming or entertainment demonstrations featuring off-line captured/computer-generated content, studio-type settings, and high-end workstations to sustain its high data/computing workload.

Wireless data usage is doubling every year and network providers are projecting demand approaching one gigabit per user per day. This requires a 1000x increase in network capacity and 100x increase in worst-case data rates.

Despite the promise, however, efficient inference is extremely challenging due to processing large amounts of data at the typically resource-starved sensor nodes. This project develops efficient feature extraction and dimensionality reduction tools for decentralized sensing systems with minimal computation, storage and communication requirements of each sensor node to make sense of the surrounding dynamic environments. Students on this program will develop multi-disciplinary expertise in signal processing, machine learning, optimization, and statistics. New graduate-level courses on high-dimensional data analysis will be developed by the PI at Ohio State University. <br/><br/>More specifically, this project offers an integrated approach for subspace learning from bits, where the sampling strategy explicitly accounts for the communication burden by only requesting a single bit from each sensor node. This project opens up opportunities to develop a theory of principal component analysis (or subspace learning) based on binary sensing, where noisy data samples are synthesized into coarse yet high-fidelity binary measurements that are more amenable for communication and inference. The consideration of binary measurements is well-motivated, as in practice, measurements are either mapped to bits from a finite alphabet before computation, or available naturally in the quantized form, such as comparison outcomes from human as sensors; constraints in storage and communication are often expressed in terms of the number of bits rather than the number of real measurements; finally, binary measurements are also more robust against unknown, nonlinear and heterogeneous distortions from different sensors compared with real measurements. Unfortunately, none of the existing subspace learning frameworks is tailored to acquire and process quantized measurements, and will yield highly sub-optimal results if naive quantization is applied. This project addresses the above challenge and highlights a novel interplay between the quantity, precision, and fidelity of measurements in sensing for estimating and tracking a low-dimensional subspace in a dynamic environment. Decentralized and online inference algorithms for subspace learning are developed together with adaptive sensing schemes to speed up convergence."

Since higher frequencies can carry larger data, the terahertz band ensures much higher data rate for wireless communications which is very much desired in modern times. But it is very difficult to design and build devices working in the terahertz regime. This is due to the fact that most natural materials do not respond to terahertz radiations. Therefore, artificial materials or metamaterials have become mainstream in the development of terahertz devices. Current design of metamaterials and devices is mostly based on traditional methods and heavily depends on expert knowledge in this area. This EAGER project proposes to use genetic programming for the design and optimization of the active metamaterials and devices in the terahertz band. Genetic programming is an advanced evolutionary optimization method in which the solution is represented as a computer program and has produced human-competitive, novel designs in many fields of engineering. It is more advanced than the well-known genetic algorithm which is often used to optimize parameters in a given design so as to meet set specifications. Genetic programming does not need pre-defined topology of the design. Instead, genetic programming can figure out the optimal topology as well as other specifications. The result of this EAGER project includes novel algorithms of genetic programming and the much needed designs of active metamaterials and devices in the terahertz frequency band. <br/> <br/>The objective of the proposed work is to fully develop Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm and optimization method for designing novel active metamaterials for practical device and components implementation in the Terahertz (THz) band. Technologies in this band have significant applications in developing devices for high data rate wireless communications as well as for medical imaging, explosives detection, security screening, sensors, and so on. Development of active metamaterials in the terahertz band is critically important for the evolution of these technologies and realization of their much anticipated benefits. The multitude of possible designs of active metamaterials for variety of device technologies leads to significant process complexities that are infeasible to explore manually. Genetic Programming, on the other hand, is an advanced evolutionary optimization method and has produced human-competitive, novel designs in many fields of engineering. Earlier GP work of the research group was focused on the design of challenging broadband Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) metamaterial ground plane at lower frequency (a few hundreds of MHz). Through true 3D patterning several successful broadband designs were achieved in the ?no-man?s? frequency band. Matching genetic programming with active metamaterials development, therefore, presents a commendable approach, especially in the terahertz band, where natural materials are of limited application. Specific tasks of the proposed work include: 1) Using GP to develop active metamaterials and terahertz (THz) devices; 2) Improving the computational efficiency of GP through parallelization and implementation of more efficient (gradient based) optimization algorithms; and 3) Develop examples of optimized terahertz devices including detectors, modulators, sensors, and antenna arrays; and compare performance results with available designs based on human expertise. This work will also result in significant advances in Genetic Programming development including topology generation, tunable material integration, and improved computational efficiency that can tackle the high complexities involved in active aspects of the metamaterials and devices developments."

As the size of transistors has continued to shrink based on Moore's Law, their use by the billions in computer chips has correspondingly soared.  Amidst all of this scaling, the operating voltage has remained essentially constant for more than a decade, having major ramifications on the amount of electrical power used for computing.  In this project, a new type of transistor will be demonstrated that brings together two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials and ferroelectrics.  The nanomaterials are superb electronic materials for very small devices and the ferroelectrics make possible a phenomenon known as negative capacitance.  It is hypothesized that the marriage of these two advances will yield transistors that can operate at extremely low voltages.  Such low voltage transistors could usher in a new era of ""More than Moore"" computing, such as reducing the power consumption in data centers, which are run by high-performance transistors, to address the national need for energy efficiency by offering a ""green"" data center solution.  Additionally, there will be scientific learning regarding the use of ferroelectrics with nanomaterials that will drive a variety of new research directions.  This project will also be impactful in promoting educational diversity, as a female graduate student along with a Latino graduate student, who is a NSF Graduate Research Fellow, will carry it out.  Further, the extensive interest in nanomaterials among high school and undergraduate students makes this project ideal for attracting involvement of other underrepresented minorities around Duke through both established and new outreach programs. <br/><br/>One promising option for overcoming the significant power problem in silicon transistors is to use the negative capacitance (NC) behavior of ferroelectric (FE) insulators to lower the operating voltage by amplifying the applied gate potential.  In the last three years, a substantial uptick in research activity involving NC field-effect transistors (NC-FETs) has occurred, largely due to the demonstration that strong FE behavior can be achieved in appropriately synthesized, hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO2) thin films.  However, NC-FETs with bulk semiconductor channels suffer from poor interface quality to the FE, a lack of device scalability due to thick FE layers, and a voltage-dependent substrate capacitance that results in drive currents that are orders of magnitude lower than traditional transistors.  In this project, a possible solution to these challenges for extremely low-voltage NC-FETs will be explored by using the unique electrical and structural properties of 2D MoS2 in the gate stack to yield 2D NC-FETs.  The primary goal of the project will be to demonstrate that the unique combination of a 2D channel with HfZrO2 ferroelectrics can yield sub-60 mV/decade switching (operation below the thermal limit).  Several distinct approaches will be studied, including advancements in the atomic layer deposition synthesis and capping of the ferroelectric as well as transfer and contacting strategies for the 2D channel, in order to realize a 2D NC-FET that exhibits gate voltage amplification.  While there is considerable work in the field on NC-FETs as well as transistors from 2D MoS2, bringing these distinct areas of research together in this device is highly distinct and potentially disruptive.  Successful demonstration of a low power, high-performance 2D NC-FET will open the way for more extensive studies and programs that research the unique aspects of this device in greater depth."

For example, cyberattacks on automotive processors have already been observed. Car manufacturers are developing critical systems aimed at fusing data from several complex sensors to ensure self-driving automobiles avoid collisions with people and animals. The proposed project will seek to develop a complete theory of commercial IoT/sensor object location estimation network attack mitigation and impact based on: (1) rigorous proofs that the attacked sensors can be identified under some reasonable assumptions and (2) rigorous estimation theory-based analysis of the possible range of performance that the attacked system can achieve. The new theory should lead to technology to protect against cyber attacks on smart homes, smart buildings, smart factories and other commercial IoT/sensor systems relied upon in daily lives. The major portion of the requested funds will go towards supporting graduate students. Educating graduate and undergraduate students, from under represented groups, in these important cross-disciplinary areas will be pursued. Coordination between this research project, classes and Lehigh's Integrated Networks for Electricity (INE) interdisciplinary research initiative is broader impact associated with this project.

The research will also characterize the impact of increasing the number of observations per sensor and the number of sensors when no attacks are present.  Further, the research will analyze the impact of intersecting constraints at multiple sensors to show exactly how the intersected constraints provide a strictly smaller set containing the object location under the case of no attacks.  Large deviation analysis will be used to demonstrate that this approach can properly localize the target with high probability when a sufficient number of observations are available at each sensor.  Cases with fewer observations will be analyzed using appropriate bounds that are accurate with a finite number of observations. These analytical approaches will be employed under attacks to show that significant attacks will drive the intersected constraints to the empty set. Large deviation analysis will be used to establish that this approach can properly identify attacked sensors, under some reasonable assumptions, when a sufficient number of observations are available at each sensor with high probability.

All these systems face similar decision-making challenges due to uncertainty, complex state-spaces, combinatorial constraints, and strategic agent behavior. The aim of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project is to develop a unified framework for real-time decision-making for smart systems, built around the use of data-driven prediction oracles and non-monetary market mechanisms. Such an approach leads to policies that are simple, easy to interpret and implement in practice; understanding their performance however requires new theoretical and methodological ideas.

Such an approach leverages historical and real-time data, incorporates the unique constraints of the underlying system, and results in simple and practical policies. The cost of this simplicity is that it is harder to prove rigorous guarantees.

The massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, in combination with millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum utilization, is considered as a key breakthrough for enabling enormous data-rate increase for next generation wireless networks.  In massive MIMO systems, a very large number of antennas is employed at the base station to communicate many mobile users simultaneously. However, this large number of antennas can lead to prohibitive cost and power consumption if conventional approach which requires one radio frequency (RF) chain per antenna is adopted. This project focuses on novel hybrid precoding designs which will not only reduce the number of RF chains but also maximize the data rate. The hybrid precoding consists of analog and digital precoders, where the digital precoder is realized by a small amount of RF chains, and the analog precoder is realized by phase shifters. Therefore, the cost, complexity and power consumption of massive MIMO systems can be reduced dramatically. The proposed research can have a large impact on the design and development of future generation of wireless networks, for which massive MIMO and mmWave are key enabling technologies. The research results will be integrated into the classes for electrical engineering and computer engineering majors through designing new course projects. Research findings will be broadly disseminated through conference presentations and journal publications. Moreover, the project will help increase participation of under-represented minorities and enhance outreach activities to attract female students to careers in engineering. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate hybrid precoding design methods that can drastically reduce the cost, complexity and power consumption while approaching the optimal performance of fully-connected, unconstrained massive MIMO systems. The project formulates the hybrid precoding design of multi-user massive MIMO systems into a joint optimization of analog and digital precoders with dynamic resource allocation which includes subarray selection, power allocation, and modulation-coding-rate selection. The joint optimization will enable the hybrid system with a significantly reduced number of RF chains to achieve similar performance of fully-connected massive MIMO systems at a fractional cost. The dynamic resource allocation will help to achieve best throughput for given channel conditions. Furthermore, the proposed approach utilizes finite-alphabet inputs and statistical channel state information (CSI) instead of the idealistic Gaussian inputs and instantaneous CSI, thus improving the robustness of the optimized precoders for practical systems. The objective of this project is expected to be accomplished by three specific tasks. First, theoretical studies of the achievable data rates will address the fundamental tradeoff between performance and cost of hybrid precoding.  Second, algorithm research will derive low-complexity solutions to solve the NP-hard optimization problems. Third, machine learning techniques will be applied to learn the features and transition probabilities of the Markov decision processes governing the online resource allocation and hybrid precoding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Up to the present time, conventional static state estimators have been widely deployed in utility control centers to improve the estimation accuracy and expand the monitoring areas. However, these estimators are no longer sufficient for monitoring the modern power grid, which is experiencing increasing uncertainty and variation driven by the high penetration of intermittent renewable (especially solar and wind) generation. In fact, conventional static state estimation methods for power grids often fail in providing any useful information during transmission-line tripping and cascading grid failures when the power system rapidly changes, and state estimation results are crucially needed. There is a technical gap in modeling a complex system, which is not fully understood, and whose behaviors can change rapidly. To bridge the gap, the project team will develop a data-fusion framework for an integrated dynamic state estimator (iDSE) that can not only estimate current operational conditions but also predict their future trends, and quantify their uncertainty. Because the framework addresses the fundamental issue in the situational awareness of a complex system, the research results will shed light on that research challenge in other complex infrastructures, which are time-varying, and with high uncertainty. The project team will disseminate the new theory and methods to industry and academia, train college students, and historically underrepresented middle/high-school students. Thus the project will increase diversity and improve the preparation of future power system engineers so that the power grid can be modernized to host more renewable generation.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop a data-fusion framework for an integrated dynamic state estimator (iDSE) to estimate and predict power system states by integrating signal processing theory and statistical inference theory.

It is expected that the new iDSE will significantly increase the situational awareness of an operator and lay the groundwork for transforming state estimation and power system operations from the current static paradigm into a future dynamic paradigm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a plethora of applications where such devices could be useful, including medicine, transportation, civil infrastructure, environmental monitoring, as well as personal communications. The ability of these devices to sense their environment and communicate with each other and the internet will lead to a revolution that will improve our health, our environment and our overall quality of life. In order for the IoT revolution to become a reality, significant advances are needed to reduce the cost of these devices (so that they can be deployed ubiquitously) as well as their energy consumption (so that they can operate for long periods of time without replacement). Advances in digital hardware over the past decades has resulted in circuit miniaturization that has in turn allowed for complicated microprocessors with billions of transistors to occupy a space no bigger than the head of a pin. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed for the creation of tiny sensors and actuators that require only very small amounts of energy or minimal access to their environment in order to operate. However, the physical constraints associated with analog electronic conversion, amplification and communication have been slower to be overcome. The goal of this project is to help remedy this gap, and develop simple, low-power, low-complexity radio-frequency devices that can be used in conjunction with sophisticated software to enable the IoT vision to become a reality. <br/><br/>New techniques and hardware implementations are needed that reduce the size, cost and power consumption of transceivers that will enable ubiquitous deployment of IoT devices as well as energy efficient gigabit-per-second wireless networks. Motivated by this vision, our project focuses on several new research initiatives that will push wireless systems in this direction: (1) A new concept for massive MIMO RF hardware based on reconfigurable one-bit direct detection (DDA) antennas that potentially require neither mixers nor local oscillator generation and distribution, and enable simpler antenna feeding, high energy efficiency, lower cost and ultrafast signaling; (2) New integrated circuit implementations based on inductor tuning to validate the DDA concept and illustrate how mixer-less demodulation via wireless LO distribution can be used to dramatically simplify the RF front end for millimeter-wave frequency bands; (3) Uplink/downlink channel capacity results with one-bit ADCs/DACs that do not rely on the assumption of white quantization noise, based on a new derivation in the angular frequency domain. These results will be better suited for millimeter-wave channels that tend to be sparse and frequency-selective. (4) New types of finite field downlink precoders with one-bit DACs that do not require the standard arithmetic operations of multiplication and addition (and hence considerably simplify the necessary digital computations), and yet still substantially outperform conventional methods and can be combined with channel coding techniques; (5) More realistic models for low-resolution ADC and DAC hardware that account for out-of-band emissions and intermodulation products in the data, in order to determine under what conditions they can be ignored and how they can be mitigated otherwise. The anticipated research addresses critical challenges for next-generation wireless systems and is also of high relevance for the success of low-power IoT technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems are poised to enable and enhance numerous important applications, e.g., inspection of large-scale infrastructure, archival of historical sites, search and rescue, disaster response, military reconnaissance, natural resource management, and immersive telepresence. However, due to its emerging nature, virtual/augmented reality immersive communication is presently limited to gaming or entertainment demonstrations featuring off-line captured/computer-generated content, studio-type settings, and high-end workstations to sustain its high data/computing workload. Moreover, there is little understanding of the fundamental trade-offs between the required signal acquisition density and sensor locations across space and time, the dynamics of the captured scene (motion, geometry, and textures), the available network and system resources, and the delivered immersion quality. This renders existing solutions impractical for deployment on bandwidth and energy constrained remote sensors. The project addresses these challenges via rigorous analysis and concerted algorithmic and application advances at the intersection of multi-view space-time sensing and signal representation, delay-sensitive communication, and machine learning.

These methods have made pervasive impacts in a wide class of application domains. The shift towards autonomy by the automotive industry in examples such as replacing mechanical systems with computer controlled electronic control systems, has resulted in efficiencies in fuel injection, braking, throttling, etc. For electric vehicles, fuel economy, drivability, and emission control are functions of the engine design and the control strategies. For robotic systems, the desire to achieve optimal behavior is essential for efficient task execution. Likewise, aerospace systems have always been a mainstream application domain for optimal control methods because there has always been (and always will be) a tight coupling between performance and energy/fuel costs. As the cost of energy and the awareness of the environmental impacts of producing energy have risen, optimal control may now play a timely role in a broader spectrum of application domains. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office of the U.S. Department of Energy indicates that as much as 10-20 percent of American energy use could be saved by optimizing industrial systems. It is self-evident that optimal control solutions can have significant impacts in a wide range of industries, but the development of optimal control solutions for real engineering systems is limited by numerous technical barriers. The most fundamental and open-ended problems arise from barriers associated with developing optimal solutions in the presence of uncertainty. The driving question in this project is how to arbitrate between gaining knowledge about a system while simultaneously making the optimal control decision for engineering systems that are uncertain and complex.<br/><br/>The technical aims of this project are motivated by the hypothesis and observations from preliminary efforts that nonlinear analysis methods can be exploited to design real-time approximate optimal solutions, while concurrent background processing methods can be used to update the optimal control approximation for improved performance. Intellectual merits in this project are realized through the development of classes of closed-loop controllers with associated stability analysis, and advanced function approximation methods, that ensure sufficient exploration of the system response while learning the approximate optimal control solution. Outcomes of this research would allow for optimal control implementation in a broader class of application domains where the system exhibits nonlinear behaviors and uncertainty. The broad impact of this framework is a merger of methods that bridge the gap between the computational intelligence community and control systems community to enable data-based learning methods to optimize control performance."

Although such sensors usually have wireless data communication capability, transmitting raw sensed data is usually not an option because of limited battery power, since in a wireless sensor the radio communication power is usually much higher than the signal processing power. Therefore, intelligent sensors need to be capable of providing preprocessing of raw data based on signal processing algorithms and sending only the processed results. Another inevitable challenge in biomedical applications is oversampling. This is because the targeted biomedical signals usually have a wide fractional bandwidth in the frequency spectrum, and require time-frequency analysis. Therefore, in these applications, the Analog to Digital Convertor (ADC) have to apply oversampling in order to avoid the signal distortion introduced by anti-aliasing filters due to the trade-off between fast roll-off and flat group delay. The requirements of both oversampling and the higher resolution also exacerbate the power problem. One promising solution to the above challenges is Delta-Sigma technology. The research objective of this CAREER proposal is to apply Delta-Sigma based Integrated Circuit (IC) design in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to solve circuit power and area problems for the next-generation of low-power intelligent sensors. The proposed research will have a broad impact on next-generation pervasive computing and ubiquitous sensing applications. The educational objectives of this CAREER proposal are promoting active, inquiry-based learning, introducing students to interdisciplinary study and research, and preparing them to meet the future expectations of both academia and industry by providing them a complete skill set including system design, assembly, verification, and optimization, and making cutting-edge research projects more accessible to minority and underrepresented groups of students.<br/><br/>The proposed integrated linear signal processing circuits are based on Delta-Sigma re-modulation using digital Delta-Sigma modulators. Delta Sigma linear processing circuits such as adders, coefficient multipliers, and filters will be designed, fabricated, characterized, and compared to conventional signal processing systems. In particular, based on the preliminary results, the research will target a biomedical signal processor applying the Cross-Frequency-Coupling (CFC) algorithm, which includes designing of FIR and IIR Band-pass filters, Hilbert filters, and Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) circuits. The proposed system with reconfigurable resolution will be investigated in order to evaluate the benefit of introducing adaptive resolution sensors to save sensing and communication power. The proposed research significantly advances the state-of-the-art in integrated intelligent sensors by employing ideas from Delta-Sigma Modulation (DSM), Digital Signal Processing, and Integrated Circuits design in a cross-disciplinary fashion.  Specifically, the proposed research will lead to a highly power-efficient circuit and system architecture by addressing the following objectives: 1) studying design and properties of Delta-Sigma based adders and coefficient multipliers for a theoretical understanding of how they can be applied to various circuit architectures, 2) investigating Delta-Sigma based digital filters and neural network systems and exploring the feasibility of applying the proposed circuits in machine learning, and 3) developing an integrated circuit of Cross-Frequency-Coupling algorithm for electroencephalograph (EEG) signal processing using Delta-Sigma digital signal processing circuits, and evaluating the system performance compared with conventional architecture."

The objective is to achieve maximal data rates. To make the research more relevant to real-world systems, the team takes an interdisciplinary approach of joint algorithm and hardware design with the consideration of practical constraints. Consequently, the research results are expected to significantly improve the capacity of next generation wireless communication systems. The project also provides a unique opportunity to train both graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of signal processing and embedded system fields.<br/><br/>The proposed research attempts to solve the optimization problem of maximizing weighted sum-rate for interference channels by research on theory, distributed optimization algorithms, and efficient hardware design. The transformative nature of this research lies in that it adopts an interdisciplinary approach of joint algorithm and hardware design, takes advantage of recent optimal signal structure result, as well as considers many practical constraints. The PI's group recently discovered that the optimal signals have a polite water-filling structure, which is analogous to the celebrated interference alignment for infinite SNR where every user can enjoy half of the resource. The polite water-filling works for all SNR range and by exploiting it, the most efficient algorithms have been designed under the ideal assumptions of full channel knowledge and centralized optimization. Under practical constraints, the design and analysis become much more challenging. The PIs will take a holistic approach of theory, design, simulation, and experiments with practical consideration of distributed optimization, distributed channel estimation, partial channel knowledge, quantization noise, hardware processing latency, and power consumption.

In addition to well-established renewables like wind, solar and traditional hydropower, marine currents have the potential to diversify and significantly strengthen the global energy portfolio. This project will conduct basic research focused on extracting electrical power from marine currents using ocean current turbines. These turbines will operate near the sea surface in major offshore currents and will be interconnected in arrays. The project will address fundamental issues related to coordinated, safe, reliable, and robust operation of these turbines within the array for maximum energy production. Networked electrical interconnections between devices and energy storage will also be investigated, with a focus on efficiently feeding electrical power from an array of turbines to an onshore grid. A diverse population of Faculty and student researchers will contribute to this project, creating a heterogeneous network of scholars that will improve the infrastructure for research and education. Important findings from this project will be integrated with active education and outreach programs at Virginia Tech, the University of New Orleans, and Florida Atlantic University which regularly share research outcomes with the public through presentations, workshops, the web, conferences, and summer camp activities. Broader scientific and technological impacts are expected in the energy sector, ocean engineering and technology, marine vehicles and devices, as well as autonomy and control systems.<br/><br/>Ocean current turbines will be interconnected in arrays through a local feed-in which sends generated power to a grid. These devices will be affected by flow perturbations such as current shear, turbulence, marine waves, as well as the shear and turbulence generated by neighboring turbines. The overall project goal is to ensure autonomous, reliable and robust coordinated operation of these turbines for maximum energy production and proper power conditioning in the presence of realistic perturbations and sub-system failures. For this purpose fault tolerant flight control, supervisory switching control to manage sub-system failures, formation and network control for ocean current turbine farms with energy storage will be investigated. Novel control systems, which include active blade pitch angle control by leveraging helicopter flight control technology and modern multivariable constrained control techniques will be developed. Control algorithms will be created and evaluated using numerical representations of commercial devices to increase applicability and encourage transfer to the commercial sector. Power conditioning solutions that utilize energy storage will be developed and evaluated to collect power from multiple devices for transfer to shore and grid connection.

The US Clean Energy Challenge calls for a partnership of states and communities to expand solar to 140GW by 2020. Investment in renewables today is in utility-scale solar plants and wind farms, as well as small-scale distributed rooftop photovoltaics (PV).  Large solar plants are cheaper than rooftop PV, but this advantage is diminished when considering transmission infrastructure costs. Generous tax credits and net metering subsidies are responsible for much of the dramatic growth of distributed PV. Under net metering, utilities are mandated to buy back excess generation at retail prices. But tax credits are being phased out, and utilities strenuously oppose net metering policies as they allow PV owners to avoid paying for infrastructure costs and pose an existential threat to utility business models. The growth of distributed PV generation may decelerate.  This project aims to sustain and accelerate future growth in distributed PV investments by enabling connected communities to share electricity services. The central thesis is that shared PV ownership and operations can spur greater investment in distributed PV with minimal subsidy, without net metering, and with participants fairly paying for infrastructure, reserves and reliability costs.  <br/><br/>Our research will enable connected communities to efficiently use resources, reduce emissions, and support our collective sustainability goals. It will spur deeper penetration of distributed PV without subsidy, while defining new entrepreneurial opportunities in the sharing economy for electricity services. The project will integrate education and research through new interdisciplinary courses that combine technology, economics, policy, and power systems. This research is broadly applicable to other shared services including electricity storage, building energy management, and transportation networks. Specifically, we will (a) develop the infrastructure necessary for sharing electricity services, (b) analyze investment decisions of households under various tariff and subsidy designs, (c) construct behavioral model that predict consumer response to incentives, and (d) conduct an empirical assessment of sharing grounded in data.  In our architectural vision for sharing, agents interact with each other through a cloud based supervisory system. This system manages constraints, accepts supply and demand bids for shared resources, clears the market, and publishes prices. A key element of our architecture is software-define-power-flow to scale sharing to millions of clients under a peer-to-peer matching platform. We will make the business case for sharing in the energy sector using game-theoretic methods and micro-economic tools to analyze investment decisions in a sharing economy for electricity services.  Recruiting clients to share their resources is a key research challenge. Here, we will apply modern machine learning methods to identify, model, and target suitable clients.  Finally, we will use data analytics methods to make a compelling case for sharing based on city-scale data."

This research effort examines wireless communication performance techniques and limits when simple low-power devices are used to transmit and receive signals.  These devices, because of their simplicity, are constrained to transmit and receive ""one bit"" of information, and with extremely low power consumption.  However, many of them can be used together and at very high speeds, giving an overall high effective data rate.  The effort examines the potential power advantages of using such devices over conventional devices that are more capable but have much higher power consumption. The project pushes the boundaries on many areas of traditional linear systems and circuit theory, and will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate course offerings in linear systems, digital signal processing, circuit design, and microwave engineering.  The results will be used to encourage discussion about how high data rates need not require a large power budget.<br/><br/>The design of wireless communication systems that rely on classical linear-system techniques runs into difficulties with high power-consumption of circuits at carrier frequencies above 20 GHz and with bandwidths above 2 GHz.  Linear amplifiers, mixers, and high-speed analog-to-digital converters, and digital-to-analog converters in the transceiver chains become inefficient and expensive.  This research effort examines wireless communication performance limits and techniques when a novel energy-efficient ""transceiver cell"" is used for the air interface.  The transceiver cell exploits nonlinearities in its devices and circuits to obtain very low power consumption and ease of fabrication in a variety of technologies for wide bandwidths and at very high carrier frequencies.  The cell comprises a transmitter and receiver capable of modulating and demodulating a single bit per symbol.  The effort is transformative because it looks at maximizing bits/(second-Hz-Watt) in the trade-off of the performance of each cell versus the number of cells in a power-constrained system, by applying concepts from neural-networking systems of low-power nonlinear ``computational cells''."

Indeed, mm-wave technology provides multi-Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) data rates to mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, projected to grow to 200 billion by 2020. Currently, 5G/mm-wave research is very active. However, to effectively study, design, and characterize 5G/mm-wave systems, new state-of-the-art instrumentation is needed, traditionally not present in academic labs. The proposed instrumentation will provide unprecedented measurement and characterization capabilities of 5G/mm-wave antennas and devices. Therefore, it will enable Florida International University (FIU) to: (a) conduct current and future cutting-edge 5G/ mm-wave research projects, (b) develop novel 5G/mm-wave technologies for cellular networks, satellite and airborne communications,  as well as brain studies and cancer diagnoses and treatments, (c) offer new opportunities to train post-docs, graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students to become experts in high frequency radio frequency (RF) technologies, creating much needed national workforce in this area, (d) serve as a state-of-the-art technical hub in South Florida, attracting new statewide, national and international academic and industry collaborators, (e) foster new opportunities for cross-disciplinary and multi-institutional research, and (f) support the growth of a strong and diverse U.S. workforce in RF communication. Therefore, the proposed instrumentation will have significant impact in research, education, and technology development. This acquisition will further advance FIU's educational efforts to broaden participation of women and other underrepresented groups in STEM through curriculum development, REU programs, and outreach efforts. <br/><br/>The proposed instrumentation from Microwave Vision Group (MVG), called -Lab, is highly specialized and incorporates important requirements for compatibility and interoperability, across 18 GHz to 110 GHz. This instrumentation consists of an anechoic chamber equipped with absorbers, precision positioning control system, RF equipment modules (network analyzers, coaxial cables, waveguides, probes, etc.) and data post-processing.  Different modules are required for different frequency bands viz. K (18-26 GHz), Ka (26-40 GHz), V (50-75GHz), and W (75-110GHz) bands. Research in the frequency range 18-110 GHz has so far been impeded by the lack of affordable testing equipment with large measurement inaccuracies. This is mostly due to the small footprint of related RF devices. As a result, research activities in related communications, biomedical, and other scientific fields have been so far limited to much lower frequency range. The procurement of such instrumentation will eschew traditional limitations often encountered with high frequency testing and characterization of future mm-wave, terahertz, and IoT components devices and systems. The broadband frequency (18-110GHz) offered by this instrumentation will enable groundbreaking and transformative research in RF communications with multi-Gbps data rates.  Such capability will revolutionize a) cellular networks, b) airborne and satellite communication systems, c) vehicle-to-vehicle communications, d) reconfigurable and deployable RF systems, e) wearable and implantable devices, f) brain and cancer studies, g) terahertz and mm-wave cameras, h) terahertz sources and on-chip terahertz antennas, and i) secure communications among others.

In recent years, these attacks have crept from theory to reality, with attacks on vehicles, electrical grids, and industrial plants, which have the potential to cause destruction and even death outside of the digital world.  CCPA raise a unique challenge with respect to cyber-physical systems (CPS) safety.  Historically, technologies to defend cyber attacks and physical attacks are developed separately under different assumptions and models.  For instance, cyber security technologies often require the complete profile of the physical dynamics and the observation of the system state, which may not be available when physical defects exist. Similarly, existing system control techniques may efficiently compensate for the physical damage, but under the assumption that the control software and the sensor data are not compromised.  There is a lack of unified approaches against CCPA.  With this observation, this project focuses on the development of unified models with coherent set of assumptions, supported by integrated technologies, upon which CCPA can be defended much more effectively.<br/><br/>To establish theoretical foundations and engineering principles for resilient CPS architectures, this project will investigate unified models and platforms that represent the scientific understanding of resilient CPS against CCPA.  Engineering of CPS will be addressed through the development and integration of complexity-reduced software architectures, along with their design principles, which lead to verifiable and certifiable architectures with higher level of system resilience. Technology of CPS will be addressed through the design of new attack detection, isolation, and recovery tools as well as timing and control techniques to ensure appropriate responses to CCPA.  The proposed inherently interdisciplinary research will ensure predictable performance for resilient CPS, by leveraging the disciplinary advances in (i) the design and evaluation of robust fault-tolerant control systems yielding significantly enhanced levels of safety in highly unpredictable environments; (ii) the design and implementation of complexity reduction architecture yielding a significant reduction in the verification time from hours to seconds; (iii) the development of multi-rate sampled-data control and robust reachability-based attack detection techniques ensuring that the sensor data is reliable; and (iv) the development of cyber-physical co-adaptation that optimizes control performance and computation task scheduling to guarantee system safety and efficient recovery from CCPA.  The target application of this project is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  The research results will be evaluated in three different testbeds: UAV testbed, generic transportation model (GTM) aircraft, and power system virtual testbed (VTB).  The technological advancement from this project will provide solutions for the safety and reliability issues faced by today's CPS and deliver dependable CPS that are applicable without sacrificing functionality or accessibility in complex and potentially hostile networked environment. The results of this project will be communicated in archival journal publications, conference venues and various workshops and lectures, and will be integrated at different academic levels."

This project aims to develop a fundamentally new memory technology that can store data by changing the material's internal configuration at the atomic scale, leading to significantly improved device performance. The proposed program will significantly advance fundamental scientific research and enhance the understanding of interface control, ionic and electronic transport and hybrid device integration at the nanoscale. Results obtained from this NSF-funded program will also likely lead to successful technology transfers that can result in industry-leading memory products, and have a transformative impact on the crucial semiconductor industry sector. The tools, methods and techniques developed in the program can be applied to a wide range of nanoscale devices and systems to stimulate research in a broad range of areas. The project will in turn provide interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students, and draw broad participation of students of different levels and backgrounds in collaborative research and education.<br/><br/>The proposed device is based on the concept of resistive random-access memory (RRAM), which has shown excellent scalability and several other performance metrics. However, the technology still faces fundamental challenges, including large device variations, high programming current and small on/off ratio, which prevent the device from practical applications. The proposed project aims to achieve atomic-level control of the fundamental ionic processes underlying the resistance changes in RRAM, and produce devices with significant performance improvements and new device functions. Specifically, the proposed device exploits atomically-thin graphene as an ion-blocking layer to regulate oxygen vacancy (VO) generation and migration through nanoscale openings in the graphene film. The filament formation will further be confined inside the switching layer to localized channels that are favorable for VO transport and storage through controlled doping. The experimental studies will be supported by theoretical calculations and modeling, including first-principles calculations that predict the VO formation energy and O-O distance, as well as numerical modeling that predicts the VO distribution and dynamic migration processes. The proposed approaches will eliminate excessive VOs in the switching layer and will significantly improve the on/off ratio, programming current, and device variability of RRAM devices.

Image registration is a key image analysis technique to estimate spatial correspondences between images. However, while good results have been obtained, registration methods are typically slow, specifically, when complex deformations are to be captured. This limits the utility of these algorithms (i) for very large-scale imaging studies, (ii) as component algorithms of more advanced analysis algorithms, and (iii) for applications which would benefit from rapid solutions, for example, to facilitate user interaction. Furthermore, registration methods are typically ill-adapted to given tasks, as, for mathematical convenience only, approaches use simple elastic or fluid models from physics. This lack of task-specificity impairs achievable registration accuracy, even for state-of-the-art algorithms.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project will therefore further develop, invent, and investigate fast analysis approaches based on replacing costly numerical optimizations by fast, approximate, learned regression models for image registration. Using such learned regression models will facilitate analysis approaches which were previously not easily possible due to computational constraints (for example, general large-scale image analysis or geodesic regression approaches for images which use deformation distances to measure model residuals}. This project will also explore regression models for task-specific registrations (for example, for longitudinal data) and will therefore open up the possibility to achieve registration accuracies beyond the current state-of-the-art. The project results will have immediate impact on current brain imaging studies and will form the basis for advanced analyses of brain and general imaging data.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: While the proposed methods are motivated by the analysis of brain images, the invented methods will have more general applicability, e.g., to analyze abdominal, lung, or even non-medical image data. For flexibility and to assure utility of the approaches in other application domains, all methods will be made available to the community in open-source form. This will allow others to adapt approaches, to replicate results, and to create customized analysis approaches. To ease interpretability of results we will provide simple visualizations and approaches for uncertainty quantification, thereby facilitating communication between computational analysts and domain experts."

However, multimedia data need to be timely delivered within the required time period called delay-bound, because any received multimedia data exceeding its delay bound is considered useless and discarded. But, because of randomly time-varying wireless channels and interferences, the deterministic delay-bound requirements for high-volume multimedia wireless transmissions are practically infeasible. Thus, the statistical delay-bounded quality of service (QoS) guarantee theory is developed as an alternative solution to achieve wireless multimedia transmissions where we guarantee the delay-bound with a small violation probability. Availability of techniques capable of statistical delay-bounded QoS guarantee over cooperative wireless networks with mitigated interference would be a breakthrough in the next-generation wireless network research. The objective of this research is to conduct the basic studies on how to extend and implement the statistical delay-bounded QoS guarantee theory for supporting multimedia traffics over interference mitigated cooperative wireless networks. The engineering approach lies in the development of cross-layer optimization and cooperative distributed multi-antenna based architecture and algorithms to support the statistical delay-bounded QoS guarantee. The proposed framework will form a basis for deriving the novel cooperative effective-capacity and game theories for optimal power control over interference-mitigated cooperative wireless networks. Also, the proposed research will be well integrated with PI's educational plan in developing the new graduate/undergraduate curricula/course-labs at Texas A&M University.<br/><br/>While the statistical delay-bounded QoS guarantee theory has been shown to be a powerful technique and useful perform metric for supporting the time-sensitive multimedia transmissions over mobile wireless networks, how to efficiently apply and implement this technique/performance-metric through employing various emerging advanced wireless communications technologies has neither been well understood nor thoroughly studied. To overcome the above challenge, this project proposes to develop a set of cooperative-wireless networking based architectures, algorithms, and schemes through cross-layer design to support diverse statistical delay-bounded QoS and  users' subjective measure of quality of experience (QoE) requirements for mobile users, while mitigating the interferences caused by coexisting links and mobile user cooperation. The proposed framework will be mainly based on the cooperative distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system to increase the coverage and capacity for multimedia wireless networks. But, the cooperative distributed MIMO network imposes new designing issues on the coordination, resource allocation, and diverse mobile users' delay-bounded QoS/QoE guarantees. Furthermore, due to multiple cooperative users, the transmit power is distributed over multiple transmitters at different locations. Consequently, the interfering range caused by cooperation is considerably enlarged, lowering the spatial frequency-reuse efficiency and thus decreasing wireless network?s capacity. To solve the aforementioned problems, the PI proposes the following research plans, goals, and activities: 1) Develop statistical delay-QoS/delay-QoE aware cross-layer architecture for optimal base-station selection in the cooperative distributed MIMO system; 2) Develop statistical delay-QoS/delay-QoE driven cooperative-effective-capacity and cooperative-game theories based framework for optimal power control algorithms and interference management; 3) Design interference-mitigated cooperative wireless network-coding schemes to enhance the statistical delay-QoS/delay-QoE guarantees in multi-hop Ad Hoc wireless networks; 4) Extend two-dimension to three-dimension delay-QoE characterization by taking into account the delay-bound violation and buffer-overflow probabilities; 5) Develop modeling and analysis techniques, and simulation-tools/testbeds to validate and evaluate the proposed mobile networks' architectures, theories, algorithms, and schemes."

The proposed research is inspired by Waze, a highly successful GPS-based mobile navigation application program that provides real-time traffic information, based on user-submitted travel times and route details. Inspired by Waze, this project is centered around the vision that future generation smartphones will be able to carry out real-time spectrum sensing and sharing of the communication environment, through built-in spectrum sniffers and the help of shared usage information from mobile devices. This research shall enable a paradigm shift from existing cognitive radio design approaches to usage aware spectrum sharing. Innovative implementation of a low-cost integrated broadband RF design for smartphone spectral sniffing, in combination with novel spectrum sharing techniques, will have a compelling and transformative impact in smartphone design and enable efficient spectrum sharing. The educational activities will develop skilled workforce in this area of national need by inspiring and engaging the middle and high school student population in engineering. <br/><br/>Built on this vision, this project advocates joint design of radio frequency (RF) hardware and spectrum sensing for smartphones, aiming to enable usage-aware spectrum sharing with minimal dynamic range and power consumption requirements placed on the smartphone hardware. Under this common theme, this project consists of the following research and educational thrusts. I) Low-cost RF architecture for smartphone sensing. Thrust I focuses on low-cost, integrated, broadband RF design for spectrum sensing and data transmission. The spectral sniffer leverages shared usage information to detect RF signals from 1 GHz to 18 GHz with both high dynamic range and sensitivity, and the digital transmitter enables modulation-agnostic data transmission with low handset power consumption. Built on the low-overhead design of RF hardware in this thrust, database assisted spectrum access and distributed spectrum access are explored in Thrusts II and III, respectively. II) Waze-inspired database assisted spectrum sharing. Along the same line as in the Waze application, a database is used to gather spectrum usage information from smartphones, and sends both real-time location-specific usage information and the set of potentially vacant channels in response to the requests from individual users. Each user then carries out refined sensing, followed by data transmissions. III) Waze-inspired usage-aware distributed spectrum sharing. Thrust III is dedicated to study distributed spectrum sharing, where usage information is shared only among smartphone users in the vicinity. IV) Integrate research into education and outreach by performing a diverse set of activities that include curricular tasks and K-12 outreach."

There is no telling the impact broadband mobile communication with tens of gigabits per seconds will have on societies across the world. However, one important goal for next generation wireless systems is to save energy while accommodating 10 times more data traffic. RF power amplifier (PA) is the component that consumes most energy in both base-stations and cell phones. Therefore, energy-efficient mobile network requires highly efficient RF amplifiers. This project contributes to this thrust by introducing a paradigm shift in design methodology that will enable faster and more effective design to achieve significant energy savings. In addition to these technical goals, the proposed research will also provide critical support to the wireless industry by training personnel for advanced 5G circuit design. A proactive data management plan will also be pursued for maximizing the impact of this project and its dissemination via an archival website and participation in the NSF Connection One Center funded by NSF IUCRC program. The research results will also be introduced in the classroom and in our educational labs. To provide a close exposure to these exciting research activities, undergraduate students in engineering will be recruited through a summer internship program to work on relevant sub-projects. Inspiring outreach activities in wireless technologies will also be scheduled to promote engineering education in high-schools and middle-schools.<br/><br/>The development of highly efficient RF power amplifiers is required for the cost-effective deployment of next generation energy-efficient wireless networks accommodating 10 times more data traffic. Presently, RF PA designers rely on multi-harmonic source- and load-pull measurements or simulations for designing power-efficient PAs. Due to the huge multi-dimensional search space in design, this design technique is extremely slow and inefficient. In this project, the direct design of RF power amplifiers using the recently developed embedding PA technique will be pursued. The amplifiers are first designed at the current source reference planes. It is indeed now fully understood that for the optimal operation of RF power transistors, the designer must target on optimal operation at the intrinsic current-source reference-planes of the transistors. In this project, new PA classes and architectures will be investigated and compared to traditional ones. Until recently, the practical realization of ideal intrinsic PA mode of operation in the real-world remained crippled by the presence of linear and nonlinear device parasitics, which required time-consuming and inaccurate multi-harmonic source- and load-pull searches. However, with the advent of the embedding device model, optimal designs can now be obtained in a single simulation. This approach will be further applied in this proposal to multiple interconnected transistor circuits. With this embedding design approach, new broadband circuit topologies never conceived before can now be explored for achieving the highest performance possible for broadband 5G applications. This embedding design technique should also eventually facilitate the development of tools for the automatic design of optimal high-efficiency RF PAs. This paradigm shift in RF circuit design has the potential to unleash the true power of electronic design automation (EDA) tools in RF circuit design."

The architecture and composition of modern power systems have been undergoing significant changes recently. These include new sources, such as gas-fired plants and co-generation facilities, and from new loads connected through power electronic converters and tightly controlled through local communication networks. The programmable nature of new sources and loads offers new capabilities, but at the same time necessitates frequently repeated model verification. Models preferred by energy engineers are often motivated by the physical properties of components and sub-systems. These models are typically nonlinear in terms of parameters. However, reliable identification of parameters from measurements is a challenging problem that is largely unsolved for the case of nonlinear models. This project aims to deploy new model verification tools that combine profound mathematical foundations (differential geometry and information theory) with modern computational algorithms. This project will have direct implications on other branches of engineering that use similar types of models. Within energy systems, this project has the potential to result in economic, environmental, and resilience benefits by enabling more precise operation of future electricity markets and control in actual power plants and customer sites.<br/><br/>This project builds on computational advances in differential geometry, and offers a new, global characterization of challenges frequently encountered in system identification and model reduction of energy systems. The premise of this approach is that a model with many parameters is a mapping from a parameter space into a data or prediction space.  A key difficulty in dealing with models of complex systems is the highly anisotropic nature of the mapping between the parameters and data spaces, meaning that small variations in parameter space may lead to dramatic changes in the measurement (data) space while other variations in parameters can lead to no discernable change in the in the model behavior. This project will use event recordings from daily operation (e.g., from phasor measurement units following line switchings and load variations) to motivate new model validation and selection algorithms. The long-term vision is to develop global and semi-global identification procedures for nonlinearly-parametrized energy components and systems, to establish limits of performance with phasor measurement unit sensors, to develop novel model reduction procedures, and to lay the groundwork for identification of large-scale energy systems. Specific goals include: 1) parameter identification for wind and solar plants, including more detailed manifold maps; 2) parameter identification for conventional sources (synchronous generators) and loads; and 3) re-parametrization and reduction for models that are typically employed in dynamic studies. Simulations will use industry-standard and custom software and recordings of hardware experiments to quantify progress. Anticipated results will be relevant for microgrids, virtual entities (virtual utilities, energy hubs) that are often considered essential in the long-term evolution of smart grids, and future electricity markets that will likely operate on shorter time-scales and thus depend on model fidelity of system dynamics."

It is expected that mobile data traffic will increase by up to 1000X by 2020 as compared to 2010. Future 5G wireless systems (communication data rates > 50Gbps) will deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and novel RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. Research on 5G massive MIMO systems is moving forward at an electrifying pace. It will be possible to point electromagnetic beams towards moving targets while simultaneously communicating at extremely high speeds and minimizing interference with other users. Downloading a high definition film will be possible in less than a second. However, with the dramatically increasing levels of circuit complexity and higher operating speeds, the underlying electronics will be highly susceptible to manufacturing process variations, electrical degradation and defects. At high data rates of communication, the effects of device non-idealities on RF system performance can be dramatic. Power consumption will be a major issue since a large number of transmitter and receiver chains will be involved. Such massive MIMO systems will need to be tested extensively and tuned for quality prior to sale.  In the extreme, such systems will need to possess built-in self-testing and self-tuning capability to automatically compensate for field wear and tear due to electrical, thermal and mechanical stress.<br/><br/>The first problem to solve is efficient low-cost manufacturing production test of a range of MIMO systems with the capacity to handle 5G systems with 10-100 RF chains. State of the art test methods require that test signals to individual RF chains have frequency separation for the individual RF chain non-linearities to be assessed independent of nonlinearities in other chains. Conversely, given a set of frequencies that can be generated, only a certain maximum number of RF chains can be tested in parallel. A key goal is to design ""frequency-efficient"" tests and back-end response analysis algorithms that do not require such frequency separation allowing large numbers of RF chains to be tested in parallel.  A second key goal is parallel gain and phase tuning of as many RF chains as possible using intelligent testing and response-analysis algorithms. One way to speed up the tuning procedure is to use the parallel testing procedure described above, to perform parallel tuning of the MIMO system well. Such parallel tuning can be supported by machine learning algorithms that predict the best tuning knob configurations for each chain based on specific time and frequency domain response features extracted from parallel testing techniques. To enable testing and tuning, high-speed signals need to be captured and analyzed for signal fidelity. To this end, the use of proposed incoherent undersampling for acquisition of test response signals provides a significant avenue for reducing testing costs by significantly simplifying the hardware required for high-speed device testing and characterization. Overall, the use of the proposed techniques will allow massive MIMO systems to be tested and tuned, post-manufacture and in the field, without the need for complex test instrumentation in 10s of ms test time, significantly reducing test cost while increasing product yield and field reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, its potential as a mathematical tool in imaging is yet to be explored. This project develops a Deep Learning based theory, methods and algorithms for passive Radio Frequency (RF) imaging in complex environments using illuminators of opportunity. With the proliferation of wireless communications and broadcasting signals, passive RF imaging has emerged as a potential alternative to active imaging with several advantages. Passive imaging does not require spectrum allocation. It is environmentally friendly and capable of stealth operations. Passive RF systems are lightweight, small, inexpensive, and easy to build and operate, making them suitable for deployment on small uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs). These attributes make passive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology suitable for a vast array of everyday civilian applications ranging from agriculture to infrastructure monitoring.<br/>While UAV-based passive SAR has the potential to revolutionize imaging across many domains of applications, one of the fundamental bottlenecks in the deployment of these systems is the challenges in image formation. Unlike active imaging, passive SAR image reconstruction involves many unknowns and uncertainties including transmitter locations, transmitted waveforms, multiply scattering and dynamically changing wave propagation environments and limited communication and computational resources. These challenges rule out the use of existing methods such as the usual Fourier transform based or iterative ones.<br/><br/>This project takes a radically different approach to imaging and interprets physics-based modeling and image reconstruction as machine learning tasks. Deep Learning excels in extracting features from data automatically bypassing hand-crafting process of modeling and feature engineering. Conventional approach to imaging involves physics based and statistical modeling, estimation, tomography and optimization. Central to this project is to remove this separation between different domains of expertise and learn and refine models and perform optimization within Deep Learning framework from training data. This takes advantage of Deep Learning's ability to generate complex, non-linear functions to jointly learn wave propagation and prior models and hyperparameters to improve accuracy and robustness. The network designs range from entirely data-driven model-free approaches to ones that are guided by Bayesian inference and optimization theory. The resulting image reconstruction methods are expected to be more robust and accurate with respect to uncertain and dynamically changing environments and unknown imaging parameters and computationally more efficient than state-of-the-art alternatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing new methods for improving our understanding of hidden mechanisms behind power system vulnerability is, hence, a critical step towards protecting economic stability and human life and facilitating societal resilience on a broad front. Complex networks offer a natural representation of power systems, where generators and substations are specified as vertices and electric lines are sketched as edges.  There are generally two main approaches to the analysis of power systems using complex networks. The first approach is based on purely topological properties of a grid network, and the second hybrid approach aims to incorporate electrical engineering concepts, e.g. impedance, maximum power, etc., into the complex network analysis, which typically results in a representation of a grid as a weighted directed graph. Both approaches provide important complementary insights into hidden mechanisms behind functionality of power systems, and neither approach can be viewed as a universally preferred method.  This project aims to introduce novel concepts of topological data analysis into studies of power systems that will capitalize on strengths of both complex network tools and electrical engineering concepts.

With mobile technology becoming almost ubiquitous and with the types of enriched features and services that are available to the end user, mobile devices are being required to support higher data rates. Unfortunately, this need for higher data rates is resulting in systems that are now required to support communication in many different, non-contiguous frequency bands spread between 0.4 and 6 GHz. The current solution consists of using multiple, parallel, single-band power amplifiers resulting in modern cellular telephones having upwards of ten separate power amplifiers. Ultimately, this problem will result in mobile devices becoming bulkier, more expensive, and unable to support key new multi-band technologies. The root problem is that, conventionally, a single power amplifier can support only a single band. Researchers have tried to address this problem through the design of concurrent multi-band power amplifiers, but, these systems suffered significant drops in performance that were largely unexplainable using conventional design theories. This research will provide a detailed understanding of the design trade-offs in concurrent multi-band power amplifiers and a new set of design techniques. The proposed research will give radio frequency (RF) designers a new set of tools enabling them to address the challenges posed by next generation wireless system design. In addition, this project will provide methods for increasing overall power efficiency and thereby increasing battery life in multi-band systems.  Moreover, this project will strengthen the U.S. transceiver industry through research, through bolstering the number of women and minorities in undergraduate and graduate STEM programs, and through supporting local industry with presentations and collaborations.<br/><br/>Modern power amplifier design is besieged on two fronts: concurrent multi-band communication is becoming a reality and wireless devices must support a variety of different communication standards. This is leading to transmitters that must support communication over many different frequency bands spread between 0.4 and 6 GHz. The current approach of using multiple, single-band power amplifiers in parallel is becoming unsustainable and new technology is going to be required for next generation wireless devices. One promising technique is the use of concurrent multi-band power amplifiers wherein a single power cell/matching network is capable of supporting multiple, simultaneous signals. Unfortunately, there is currently no existing theoretical framework to describe the maximum efficiency, output power, stability, or linearity of concurrent multi-band power. The continued lack of such basic knowledge will fundamentally limit the potential of this new technology to address the needs of future wireless devices. This proposal will develop both a theoretical framework and a set of practical guidelines for the analysis and physical implementation of such power amplifiers. Together, these results will give RF designers a new set of tools with which they can reduce the current number of power amplifiers in modern devices, and facilitate new techniques for improving data rates and efficiency in already-designated communication bands. This, in turn, will result in a more efficient use of the available spectrum without the complicated regulatory hurdles associated with techniques such as dynamic spectrum access. The broader impact of this work lies in the ability of multi-band power amplifiers to reduce the overall cost of next generation transceivers while yielding a more flexible and robust mobile device."

In recent years, these attacks have crept from theory to reality, with attacks on vehicles, electrical grids, and industrial plants, which have the potential to cause destruction and even death outside of the digital world.  CCPA raise a unique challenge with respect to cyber-physical systems (CPS) safety.  Historically, technologies to defend cyber attacks and physical attacks are developed separately under different assumptions and models.  For instance, cyber security technologies often require the complete profile of the physical dynamics and the observation of the system state, which may not be available when physical defects exist. Similarly, existing system control techniques may efficiently compensate for the physical damage, but under the assumption that the control software and the sensor data are not compromised.  There is a lack of unified approaches against CCPA.  With this observation, this project focuses on the development of unified models with coherent set of assumptions, supported by integrated technologies, upon which CCPA can be defended much more effectively.<br/><br/>To establish theoretical foundations and engineering principles for resilient CPS architectures, this project will investigate unified models and platforms that represent the scientific understanding of resilient CPS against CCPA.  Engineering of CPS will be addressed through the development and integration of complexity-reduced software architectures, along with their design principles, which lead to verifiable and certifiable architectures with higher level of system resilience. Technology of CPS will be addressed through the design of new attack detection, isolation, and recovery tools as well as timing and control techniques to ensure appropriate responses to CCPA.  The proposed inherently interdisciplinary research will ensure predictable performance for resilient CPS, by leveraging the disciplinary advances in (i) the design and evaluation of robust fault-tolerant control systems yielding significantly enhanced levels of safety in highly unpredictable environments; (ii) the design and implementation of complexity reduction architecture yielding a significant reduction in the verification time from hours to seconds; (iii) the development of multi-rate sampled-data control and robust reachability-based attack detection techniques ensuring that the sensor data is reliable; and (iv) the development of cyber-physical co-adaptation that optimizes control performance and computation task scheduling to guarantee system safety and efficient recovery from CCPA.  The target application of this project is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  The research results will be evaluated in three different testbeds: UAV testbed, generic transportation model (GTM) aircraft, and power system virtual testbed (VTB).  The technological advancement from this project will provide solutions for the safety and reliability issues faced by today's CPS and deliver dependable CPS that are applicable without sacrificing functionality or accessibility in complex and potentially hostile networked environment. The results of this project will be communicated in archival journal publications, conference venues and various workshops and lectures, and will be integrated at different academic levels."

It can extend a user's memory and attention, not only enabling previously impossible, personalized services but also assisting people with vision or attention impairment in an unprecedented way.  While modern devices are capable of capturing and interpreting what their users see, they face a daunting physical barrier: energy efficiency. For example, performing continuous vision workloads drains the battery of Google Glass in about 40 minutes. While process technology and system-level optimization techniques may continue to improve the energy efficiency of digital circuits, a recent measurement study has pointed to a fundamental bottleneck to energy efficiency of computer vision: the image sensor, especially its analog readout circuitry.  The goal of this project is to tackle this bottleneck by designing, prototyping and evaluating a novel vision sensor architecture along with its optimization framework. By targeting computer vision, this vision sensor architecture radically departs from existing image sensor designs that are optimized for photography. Instead of producing high-quality images, it outputs application-specific features by judiciously shifting processing into the analog domain. In doing so, it promises better efficiency by orders of magnitudes for computer vision workloads and relieves the privacy concern with continuous mobile vision.<br/><br/>This project will pursue two complementary, interrelated directions toward the above goal: First, the mixed-signal vision sensor design must provide sufficient programmability under constrained complexity in the analog domain. The project will exploit a novel hardware architecture that cyclically reuses analog modules for a programmable dataflow. This architecture will employ a novel column-based topology that exploits data locality to reduce interconnect complexity for data access. The project will also investigate hardware mechanisms that allow programmable tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy of processing in the analog domain. Second, vision workloads must be carefully partitioned into analog and digital stages given the sensor architecture. The project shall provide an optimization framework that leverages accurate energy models and noise tolerance of vision workload. The project will further contribute novel use cases of the proposed mixed-signal vision sensor with data privacy, energy consumption, and task performance being the possible optimization constraints."

The architecture and composition of modern power systems have been undergoing significant changes recently. These include new sources, such as gas-fired plants and co-generation facilities, and from new loads connected through power electronic converters and tightly controlled through local communication networks. The programmable nature of new sources and loads offers new capabilities, but at the same time necessitates frequently repeated model verification. Models preferred by energy engineers are often motivated by the physical properties of components and sub-systems. These models are typically nonlinear in terms of parameters. However, reliable identification of parameters from measurements is a challenging problem that is largely unsolved for the case of nonlinear models. This project aims to deploy new model verification tools that combine profound mathematical foundations (differential geometry and information theory) with modern computational algorithms. This project will have direct implications on other branches of engineering that use similar types of models. Within energy systems, this project has the potential to result in economic, environmental, and resilience benefits by enabling more precise operation of future electricity markets and control in actual power plants and customer sites.<br/><br/>This project builds on computational advances in differential geometry, and offers a new, global characterization of challenges frequently encountered in system identification and model reduction of energy systems. The premise of this approach is that a model with many parameters is a mapping from a parameter space into a data or prediction space.  A key difficulty in dealing with models of complex systems is the highly anisotropic nature of the mapping between the parameters and data spaces, meaning that small variations in parameter space may lead to dramatic changes in the measurement (data) space while other variations in parameters can lead to no discernable change in the in the model behavior. This project will use event recordings from daily operation (e.g., from phasor measurement units following line switchings and load variations) to motivate new model validation and selection algorithms. The long-term vision is to develop global and semi-global identification procedures for nonlinearly-parametrized energy components and systems, to establish limits of performance with phasor measurement unit sensors, to develop novel model reduction procedures, and to lay the groundwork for identification of large-scale energy systems. Specific goals include: 1) parameter identification for wind and solar plants, including more detailed manifold maps; 2) parameter identification for conventional sources (synchronous generators) and loads; and 3) re-parametrization and reduction for models that are typically employed in dynamic studies. Simulations will use industry-standard and custom software and recordings of hardware experiments to quantify progress. Anticipated results will be relevant for microgrids, virtual entities (virtual utilities, energy hubs) that are often considered essential in the long-term evolution of smart grids, and future electricity markets that will likely operate on shorter time-scales and thus depend on model fidelity of system dynamics."

With increasing renewable power generation, it becomes a challenge to operate the already aging U.S. power grids efficiently and reliably. The 2003 U.S. Northeast/Quebec and 2012 India blackouts have demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of a massive blackout. However, blackouts such as these could be prevented if the power system could be monitored and controlled more accurately and timely. The transformative research proposed in this project could potentially make full usage of the high-resolution measurement data available in the power grids and develop a completely new measurement-based approach to steer the power grids away from large blackouts early on. The proposed project is also coupled with a strong educational component to engage students from underrepresented groups and a broad dissemination of research findings.<br/><br/>Based on over ten years of observation of the three major North American grids and major grids worldwide via synchrophasor measurement, strong linearity of large-scale power systems has been observed. This observation can also be verified by the interconnection-level dynamic simulations. No longer constricted by the habitual belief that the electric power grid is a nonlinear network that should be always represented by a high-order circuit-based model, this project proposes an entirely new measurement-based method to model, predict and control a large-scale interconnected power grid, especially in regard to small-signal dynamic behaviors. <br/><br/>This project will develop measurement-based power system analysis and control applications that take full advantage of this underutilized system linearity. Specifically, the proposed linearity study will characterize the strong linearity of large-scale power grids, which has been understandably neglected by the research community, as the first step. The study will analyze the source of large-scale power grid linearity and re-examine the conventional definition of small signal. Secondly, this project will construct a linear-structured model using measurements to predict a large-scale power grid?s dynamic behavior following a small-signal disturbance. Predicting a power grid's behavior is very important for large-scale interconnected power systems and this predictive capability will provide system operators with true look-ahead capabilities. Thirdly, another novel application of a large-scale power grid?s linearity involves representing the less-interested areas of a large-scale circuit-based model with measurement-based equivalent models. This hybrid circuit and measurement model will easily achieve several orders of magnitudes higher simulation speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Finally and most importantly, compared to the circuit-based model that cannot be easily updated frequently, this measurement-derived model could be updated using real-time streaming measurements and keep track of the continuous change of power grids. For example, a measurement based oscillation damping controller could be updated in real time and would be much more accurate and robust, improving the stability of an interconnected power grid. With more high-resolution measurement data available, the proposed research will have a direct and immediate impact on how the U.S. interconnected power system should be modeled, analyzed, and controlled; and this advanced approach will contribute to the energy security and efficiency of the U.S. electric power grid infrastructure."

The proposed research investigates ""super-correction"" techniques in PET imaging to revolutionize one of the most sensitive in vivo molecular imaging modalities when integrated with MRI information.

Accordingly, wearable biomonitoring technologies play a critical role in promoting awareness and adoption of healthy lifestyles for disease prevention and enabling actionable feedback. Currently, commercialized wearable sensors and Internet of Things devices are only capable of tracking physical activities and vital signs, and fail to non-invasively access molecular-level biomarker information to provide insight into the body's dynamic chemistry. Also, at the current state, blood-based sensing techniques that provide direct measurements of circulating biomarkers cannot be scaled across the general population for point-of-person daily monitoring (due to their invasive nature and risk of infection). Alternatively, other biofluids can be probed, which share biomarker partitioning pathways with blood and can be accessed non-invasively. In this regard, sweat is an excellent candidate, because it is a rich source of biomarkers that originally diffused from blood and can be retrieved in a wearable format and without user intervention. By attaining reasonable level of predictive accuracy in providing non-invasive proxy measures of blood biomarkers, wearable sweat sensors allow for monitoring the well-being of individuals and enable actionable feedback to improve their health and performance.   <br/><br/>The proposed research addresses fundamental bottlenecks critical to advancing the field of sweat-based biosensing at device, sensor, and data analytics levels. In the proposed approach, by devising programmable iontophoretic sweat induction and microfluidic interfaces, the interfering effects of confounders and contamination will be mitigated. A high throughput electro-modification sensor development methodology will be devised for the multiplexed construction of chemically diverse sensing features in microarray formats, which will be tailored to accurately measure sweat biomarkers on body. Furthermore, an analytical framework will be developed to provide undistorted measures of the sweat biomarkers, thus rendering individual-level temporal estimates of blood biomarker levels to establish the correlation and clinical utility of sweat readings. Upon achieving the proposed milestones, a new class of biomarker analysis platforms, with real-time information sensing and transmission capabilities, emerge that can facilitate general population well-being and performance monitoring. Equally important, the versatility of the devised methodologies allows for their use, with minimal reconfiguration, to target biomarkers in other biofluids (interstitial fluid, saliva, urine, and blood). The large data sets that will be collected through these technologies will expand our understanding of personal and societal health needs. Future generations of scientist will be trained by synergistically integrating the outreach and education plans with research activities. A diverse community of high school/undergraduate students will participate in research. The research findings will be integrated in the biosensing courses that the PI is developing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It could also enhance our power and energy sustainability and restorability in severely adverse weather conditions. It has the potential of starting a new revolution in creating intelligent Power Grid and Microgrids by extending todays microchip technology to integrated multi-sensing and information processing in a single compact device -- specialized for Power and Energy arena. Advanced sensor models integrated with Power Grid and Microgrids models will be developed for achieving the true potential of the intelligent sensors and analyzers (proposed herein) that would be deployable on a massive scale. The project will also promote teaching, training and learning in this key technology area. Specifically, the sensors, process-flow, and specialized microchip design activity of the project will be imported into the undergraduate senior-design projects. The project will also significantly benefit several graduate courses including a new course on Smart Power Grids, and existing courses on Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems II, and System on a Chip. The advances will be shared with the power and energy industry, government, and academia through a dedicated web site and, of course, through scientific publications.<br/><br/>As stated above, the goal of this project is to improve the reliability and restoration capability of wide area Power Grid as well as its affiliated Microgrids thereby reducing power outages and their cascade effects. Our solution is to embed novel intelligent sensors with distributed processing tools to provide real time monitoring and control of ""Power Grid as well as its affiliated Microgrids"" from transmission and distribution levels. The problems associated with the present lack of a real time intelligent infrastructure to monitor and control Power Grids -- on a massively distributed basis, have resulted in numerous blackouts and other serious inefficiencies. Our sensors/analyzers will provide accurate information to protective relays, enable intelligent islanding, a means by which the modeling of loads can be based upon accurate measured data rather than estimated data, for load shedding plans. The unique sensor architecture, fabrication, and signal processing issues will be addressed through an advanced Heterogeneous Sensor System on a Chip. As just stated, included will be Microgrids, in which the focus will be on islanding and restoration, sensors, estimation of key variables (frequency, phase and amplitude -- for harmonics as well when desired), defect and fault tolerance, thereby reliability improvement. Microgrids incorporate renewable energy sources, among others. System on a Chip based sensors can provide effective, real-time monitoring and control  that is self-healing, for such sources.

Effective solutions for such algorithms need to be distributed and implementable within the limitations inherent in communication devices. Furthermore, in many applications, these solutions also must have transparent privacy preservation properties to make them acceptable for everyday use. This proposal's research objective is to investigate how automatic control-theoretic tools can be used to develop and analyze distributed dynamic optimization algorithms that respect the restrictions inherent to communication channels and address concerns regarding privacy preservation of participating agents in smart network operation. The results of this research will facilitate the realization and adoption of optimal in-network solutions in many important cyber-physical applications, such as smart grid, sensor networks, and distributed data regression in the healthcare and banking sectors.

For a robust, active, and smarter communication strategy, event-triggered communication approaches will be used to enable each agent to locally decide when it is necessary to communicate in order to preserve the algorithm's integrity. Finally, to achieve transparent privacy preservation, this project will include development of observability tests to identify a knowledge set that enables eavesdroppers to construct the private data of other agents in the network using sophisticated observers, such as neuro-observers. The project will also include design of solutions for resistance of these intrusions by developing tools and methods to create augmentations that induce privacy preservation in distributed dynamic optimization algorithms."

As a result of its excellent speed and precision characteristics, it has found application in a wide variety of areas. For example, quantum key distribution, the secure communications method of the future, crucially relies on timing precision of photon detection in order to guarantee security. In a related field, emerging quantum computing thrusts such as those taking place on photonic integrated circuits rely on the precise detection of single photons. Unfortunately, although the speed limitations of the superconducting nanowire single photodetector are well understood, we do not yet understand what limits timing precision (typically referred to as ""jitter""), and thus cannot yet engineer improvement. Many theories have been developed that can explain how these superconducting nanowires function. However, none of these theories can justify the jitter seen in these detectors. In this work, we will investigate the fundamental limits of jitter in superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and thus enable improvements in a wide array of application areas.  For example, communication data rates depend directly on the jitter because the standard low- power digital communication protocol, pulse-position-modulation, uses timing precision to enhance the data rate. By investigating and characterizing possible sources of timing jitter in these detectors, this work will directly increase the impact of the relevant applications in industry, space, and defense.<br/>Although superconducting nanowires have been studied since the 1970s and have been used as radiation sensors for over 13 years, their picosecond-time-scale dynamics are still not fully understood. Early attempts to explain the timing dynamics in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors focused on possible microscopic origins. In the field of radiation sensors based on superconducting nanowires, some theories related these picosecond-time-scale effects to environmental causes and others to processes intrinsic to the physics of the superconducting nanowires. For example, the hotspot model of the detection mechanism was suggested to explain the time delay between the photon arrival and voltage response as a function of number of incident photons at two different bias currents, but fitting to a theoretical model of gap suppression time was poor and no mention of jitter was made. Later, phase slip centers were purported as the mechanism for the initial hotspot creation but again, no substantive connection to jitter came about from those analyses. In this project, we will probe commonly accepted theories in the field as well as unexplored sources of jitter using both numerical and experimental approaches. We have identified several key components of the nanowire operation that we consider likely sources of jitter: (1) nanowire self-resonance; (2) trapping of vortices; and (3) stochastic elements in the microscopic physics of the hotspot. We intend to characterize the jitter contributions of each of these possible sources, and design modified devices that can reduce these contributions to jitter."

Three highly interdependent CIs are the focus of this research: electric power systems, information and communication technologies (ICT), and electricity- based vehicles/transportation (e-transportation). Network modeling of failure modes and propagation is needed by managers to devise strategies that mitigate the impact of failures across interdependent CIs. Although much progress has been made in network modeling of CIs to date, these efforts fail to capture the complexity of CIs, are based on inadequate or inaccurate assumptions, neglect interdependencies, and are mostly empirical and statistically driven rather than based on principles of physics. The objective of this research is to improve failure and resilience modeling of interdependent CIs. This work will then be expanded using reinforcement learning to aid in decision-making. The outcome will be a framework to account for CI interdependencies that are critical for failure and disaster planning and recovery.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. The influence graph-based model and reinforcement learning-based interdependency mitigation framework eloquently address a key problem that has long challenged city/infrastructure planners and operators: how to model, forecast, and prevent cascaded failures that propagate through multiple critical infrastructures. Current approaches lack accuracy and the ability to handle complexities and interdependencies. This work applies detailed physics-based bottom-up modeling coupled with the innovative application of reinforcement learning to provide a transformative advancement to the field, resulting in a much more flexible and accurate analysis methodology for use in CI design, management, disaster planning, and recovery.<br/> <br/> Broader Impact.

They often induce catastrophic consequences in an array of inaccessible environments with complex curved geometries, ultimately leading to persistent infections, implant failure, and systemic contamination. There is demand for viable methods to detect, prevent, and remove biofilms in locales including urinary catheters, prosthetic implants, and water systems, where currently effective methods do not exist to detect and eradicate biofilms. Advances in flexible device technology yield opportunities for feedback-driven biofilm management systems for operation in these vulnerable areas. The objective is to develop a paradigm enabling dynamic flexible sensor microsystems for detecting, monitoring, and inhibiting biofilms on multidimensional surfaces, in particular the cylindrical environment of a urinary catheter. The surface bacterial species, fluid conditions, and geometry are the basis for this approach, creating a guide for identifying methods of biofilm detection and prevention on demand. Successful monitoring and removal of biofilm will have a dramatic impact, improving quality of life for people of all demographics. These systems have the potential to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant and healthcare-acquired infections, and are particularly attractive for addressing these challenges in resource-poor regions. Moreover, the potential for low-cost manufacturing of these devices will enable their inclusion by high school teachers into laboratory-based STEM curricula.<br/><br/>To systematically develop this methodology, the objective of this proposal is divided into three tasks: 1) Optimization of microsystems for sensing and inhibiting biofilms in complex, 3D environments: Thin film electrodes will be selected as a simple and sensitive electrochemical impedance sensor, tested in a microfluidic system as a sensor and biofilm inhibitor via the bioelectric effect. Furthermore, the device will be optimized for biofilm detection via a computational model. The model will examine changes in the electric field of the sensor for the relevant geometry. 2) Manufacturing of integrated flexible devices for biofilms: appropriate materials and fabrication processes are determined by specific geometric and environmental requirements of each application, notably flexible substrates, such as polyimide, with gold as an inert electrode material. The flexible substrates will enable folding and scaling of the device as required to interface with the vulnerable complex curved surface. 3) Device testing using environmental model with data transmission and feedback control: A urinary catheter will serve as a test case. This will be developed considering the unique geometric, bacterial, and fluidic conditions. 3D-printed structures precisely recreate geometry interactions with biofilm, where sensor response and bioelectric treatment will be evaluated simultaneously. A wireless controlled (using Bluetooth or Wifi) electronic system will be developed to operate the impedance sensor and control the biofilm removal using the electrodes will be developed. Feedback-driven dynamic biofilm control will be developed, considering threshold impedance sensing values corresponding to biofilm biomass. The system will introduce a bioelectric effect treatment based on impedance sensor data indicating the formation of a biofilm in real-time. This project addresses the challenge of preventing, identifying, and removing biofilms on a complex surface. An interdisciplinary approach combining applied microbiology and engineering disciplines is required to overcome these problems. Complex interactions between flexible sensors, bacterial biofilms, and bioelectric treatment will be explored. Electrical reduction of biofilm enables remote programmability in vulnerable systems. The impact on system design of key parameters including bacterial species, surface geometry, and fluidic conditions will be clearly enumerated. The fundamental methodology developed here will enable further research to address biofilm monitoring and removal in areas of dire need.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, due to the lack of security in the operation and communication of resource-constrained medical sensor nodes, the health and medical information provided by the WBANs may not be trusted. To address this issue, lightweight security solutions that are suitable for capability and resource limited body sensor devices must be provided to authenticate the data transmission. The goal of this research project is to develop a lightweight authentication system for resource-constrained WBANs. Findings from the proposed project will provide support for ensuring real-time delivery of accurate and secure medical information in WBANs. The proposed research will also advance the fields of WBANs and trustworthy biomedical computing for healthcare applications. The proposed theories, models, and simulation code can be used by engineers and researchers to design and evaluate security mechanisms for WBAN applications. In addition, an important education objective tightly coupled with the proposed research is to recruit and educate future generation of WBAN engineers. This will be accomplished through curriculum development, student mentoring, and community outreach in these fast changing technical fields of WBAN system engineering, security and mobile health (mHealth).<br/><br/>The proposed research aims at realizing physical layer security approaches for WBANs and developing innovative key agreement and message authentication mechanisms. Unlike existing approaches (e.g., biometric-based approaches), the proposed authentication system does not require additional hardware, error reconciliation process and bit synchronization, and thus is suitable for resource-constrained and capacity-limited medical sensor nodes in WBANs. The proposed research tasks include (1) theoretical studies; (2) design of key agreement schemes; (3) development of message authentication system; and (4) system implementation and validation. The theoretical studies focus on the connections between the channel reciprocity, channel dependency and key generation. Based on the results of theoretical studies, practical key agreement schemes that use a set of dynamic wireless channel features among the communication partners will be developed. The project will then design a lightweight authentication system that is adaptive to wireless channels for securing medical data transmission in WBANs. Finally, the project will implement the proposed physical layer security approach in a real resource-constrained WBANs system and investigate the practical system performance limit through experiments. The findings from the project can provide guidelines for physical-channel based security system design and deployment of WBAN applications."

Nevertheless, contemporary THz spectroscopy and imaging tools rely on single-polarization sensors, thus, vital polarimetric information in the sensed THz signals is often lost. In this project, a fully-polarimetric THz sensor will be developed, which will enable, for the first time, an entirely new modality for THz spectroscopy and imaging by harnessing the polarization properties of THz waves. Polarimetric THz imaging and the associated sensor hardware could change the paradigm for THz imaging by harnessing polarimetric data. It is important to note that the impact of ""polarimetry"" in the RF, microwave as well as optical bands cannot be understated, with key applications impacting many aspects of society. For example, polarimetric radars keep us safe from intruders and optical ellipsometers are routinely used in many areas of solid state materials engineering, including the multi-billion-dollar semiconductor industry. The fully-polarimetric THz sensor and the associated THz-spectroscopic polarimetry tools proposed here will usher in new sensing and imaging applications in the much-needed areas of biomedical sensing, chemical spectroscopy and pharmaceutical evaluation, to name a few. In addition, the proposed work will result in a laboratory-scale spectroscopy tool that can be readily incorporated into the academic curriculum to serve as a hands-on experimentation and training testbed to inspire students to pursue their education in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In particular, the proposed effort will realize, for the first time, novel photoconductive antenna arrays with radiation pattern and polarization purity over the THz frequency band spanning from 100 GHz to 5 THz, integrated with pulsed and/or continuous-wave laser sources to generate wideband, or tunable, fully-polarimetric THz-band sources and detectors with 3-times improved image resolution and improved spectral sensitivity. With the availability of these novel sensors, first-ever polarimetric sensing data in the form of THz reflectometric images will be demonstrated. As a most relevant and high-societal-impact application, cancer margin detection and identification using THz polarimetry will be pursued where the material properties of the healthy and malignant tissues are very close to each other due to similar bound water content. With the full-polarimetric nature of the proposed sensor, THz images obtained by the proposed sensor exhibits significantly improved contrast and thus conventional THz imaging will be significantly enhanced by the additional degrees-of-freedom afforded by the new sensor.

The intermittent operation of gas-fired power plants to compensate wind generation introduces spatiotemporal fluctuations in continuously increasing volumes of gas demand. Generation and network contingencies in power transmission systems can affect shortages in gas supplies; and vice versa, congested and suboptimally scheduled gas networks limit the integration of renewable energy. In this context, this project studies the interdependency between these two critical infrastructures through coordinated control and market operations to ensure stability, reliability, and efficiency. The research project will develop algorithmic tools for the analysis, optimization, and monitoring of natural gas networks and their interplay with electric power grids. The vision is threefold: develop a reliable computational toolbox for enhanced gas network operations leveraging advances in convex optimization; identify analogies, key differences, and opportunities by jointly dispatching the two energy systems; and engage data analytics for transforming both gas transmission and distribution networks into smarter cyber-physical infrastructures. The consequent gains in efficiency and awareness will be reflected on a wide gamut of industrial, commercial, and residential uses of natural gas; while enabling a smooth transition to the low-emission economy. Broader transformative impact will result from an educational dissemination plan, involvement of undergraduates in research, and outreach to the local community and high school students.<br/><br/>At the heart of modeling, control, and monitoring of gas networks is a set of nonlinear equations relating nodal gas injections and pressures to flows over pipelines. Building on convex relaxations, the gas flow problem is formulated as a semidefinite program that outperforms existing alternatives in terms of region of convergence and which naturally leads to coupled gas and power flow formulations. The novel scheme is generalized for optimally dispatching natural gas networks, independently or in tandem with electric power systems. To cope with uncertainty on renewable generation, and adjusting to the slower gas transients, static and dynamic setups are considered via decentralized and stochastic implementations. Efficient modules are additionally devised for enhancing situational awareness via gas network state estimation. By developing a suite of gas pressure and injection data analytics, computational efforts will aim towards enhancing local gas utility distribution networks, thus resonating with efforts for smart cities and connected communities. The utility of the proposed research goes well beyond the envisioned application area to the broader fields of stochastic optimization, statistical signal processing, control of coupled networks, inference over graphs, and dynamic modeling of fluids."

A great number of electrophysiological measurement devices have been developed including clinical equipment, research products, and consumer electronics. However, until now, it is still challenging to secure long-term stable and accurate signal acquisition, especially in wearable condition, not only for medical application in hospital settings, but also for daily well-being management. Motion-induced artifacts widely exist in electrophysiological recording regardless of electrodes (wet, dry, or noncontact). These artifacts are one of the major impediments against the acceptance of wearable devices and capacitive electrodes in clinical diagnosis. This project is to provide new strategies to mitigate motion-induced artifacts in wearable electronics and design accurate wearable electronics for daily monitoring and disease diagnosis. The PIs will disseminate the research products to both students and the research community. New course materials will be developed for undergraduate and graduate education. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research program will obtain diverse knowledge in hardware design and data analytics. For K-12 students, the PIs will provide an integrated research and educational experience through the programs of Engineering Exploration Day for Girls and the Summer Youth Program at Michigan Technological University. A research demo and hands-on experience for triboelectric generation in textile materials will be developed and provided to K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to understand the fundamental mechanism of triboelectric artifacts in wearable devices and provide synergistic solutions to mitigating the artifacts. Three approaches are proposed to achieve the goal: 1) understanding the mechanism of triboelectric charge generation in wearable condition by physical modeling and experimental validation; 2) guided by the understanding, developing tribomaterial-based sensors to manipulate triboelectric charges for artifact removal; 3) leveraging the proposed new tribomaterial-based sensors and statistical data analytics for true electrophysiological signal estimation. If successful, the synergic knowledge produced by the project will not only help improve the traditional bioinstrumentation in the medical society, but also benefit industrial community of consumer wearable electronics."

Free-space optical communication systems emerged as the most promising alternative and supplement to high-speed radio frequency data links by offering several key advantages, such as higher security, operation over unlicensed frequency spectrum, and higher information capacity. Such systems can be remarkably well-suited for rapidly establishing high-speed communication in disaster recovery areas or over difficult terrains, linking Earth stations and low-orbit satellites, providing ultra-secure inter vessel connections, or supporting high-speed data links in urban areas.  Although the information capacity of free-space optical communications is inherently higher since information is carried by frequencies from optical domain, there is need to investigate more comprehensive solutions for additional information capacity increase in order to advance high-speed free-space optical communication capabilities towards their full potential.<br/><br/>It is well known that higher information capacity can be enabled by exploiting fundamental optical parameters (time, frequency, polarization, and space) contained in a highly directed light beam. While the time, frequency, and polarization properties have been analyzed and understood in detail, theoretical and practical use of the spatial dimension is not fully explored. The goal of this project is to investigate free-space optical communication schemes by utilizing both frequency and space properties through their parallel employment within a single propagating light beam. Although this approach is highly promising, propagation through the turbulent atmosphere can drastically degrade the signal quality and thus reduce the information capacity. Therefore, an innovative approach is needed to advance solutions that can increase the information capacity and compensate for these turbulence effects. <br/><br/>The principal technical objective of the proposed project is advancement of technologically innovative multidimensional schemes that increase the information capacity of free-space optical communication systems. For that purpose, creation and propagation of spatial orbital angular momentum-based modes to carry an optimized number of spectral components will be explored.  In parallel, modulation, coding, detection, and compensation schemes and algorithms that would maximize the information capacity of free-space optical communication channel will be investigated. This approach is transformative in nature since it brings multidimensional character to design of free-space optical communication channels. The key challenge in this task will be suppression and minimization of the mutual interaction between spatial modes due to the impact of air turbulence, which would otherwise cause unacceptable crosstalk and limit the channel capacity. For this purpose, a rigorous theoretical framework for the multidimensional free-space optical communication channel will be developed and experimentally verified. It will be used to lay down the crosstalk mitigation research tasks in both optical and electrical domains to counter the effects of long-term temporal correlation. A novel architecture that combines adaptive compensation of wave-front phase distortions with advanced detection and coding schemes and algorithms will be developed to suppress the impact of impairments caused by clear-air turbulence phenomena. <br/><br/>This program will help to transform high-speed free-space optical communication technologies in the United States by advancing the understanding and practicality of entirely novel communication schemes with a significant economic potential. In addition, the tight and creative interdisciplinary integration of knowledge and expertise in information theory and photonic technology will highly benefit undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arizona, as well as those in the industrial research and development community."

Examples of this include commerce, entertainment, healthcare, navigation, safety and security, social-media, transportation and workspace productivity, in addition to basic person-to-person communication.  In the foreseeable future, the emergence of applications driven by the ""internet-of-things"", wherein a significantly larger number of devices, such as household and industrial appliances, will require wireless connectivity, will place even greater demands on the wireless infrastructure. Power efficiency of communication links, and compatibility with technologies such as advanced semiconductor processes that enable miniaturization and low-cost deployment, will be critical to future proliferation of wireless systems. Efficiency is important in both mobile and stationary devices for minimizing energy wastage. With potentially billions of wireless communication devices being deployed over the coming years, the need for efficient operation is in fact, fundamental. Power efficiency is also critical in mobile devices since it directly impacts the available operating time of the device. <br/>The proposed research will investigate design techniques for significantly enhancing the efficiency of wireless communication transmitters through innovative architectures that leverage advanced Complementary Metal ""Oxide"" Semiconductor (CMOS) processes. The research will also include an investigation of transmitter architectures that can be easily reconfigured to operate in different end environments, and on techniques that reduce the spurious interference generated by transmitters, that can degrade the performance of other devices.   <br/>A key part of the proposed research will be an investigation of Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signaling schemes, as applied to the problem of wireless transmitters. Techniques that reduce noise in the transmitter spectrum will be explored. To avoid the noise caused by quantization in the time-domain, analog-PWM techniques will be investigated. Techniques for efficient generation of PWM directly at the desired RF band without the need for frequency upconversion will be employed. This will help reduce the out-of-band spurs that can be a significant limitation in upconverted baseband PWM due to co-existence considerations. The use of phase-locked loop (PLL) based PWM generator, which allows for generation of high-speed analog PWM will be studied. The use of efficient class-D output stages to drive output loads over broad bandwidths with minimal reconfiguration will be investigated. Such transmitters can be an enabler for techniques such as channel-bonding, wherein data rates can be increased multiple-fold by combining data streams that are transmitted over multiple bands concurrently.   A practical design to validate and verify the proposed circuit techniques will be implemented in a modern CMOS technology. A practical wireless system, such as 4G-LTE will be employed for this investigation. The work will form the core of the doctoral research of one graduate student researcher, who will gain expertise in theoretical, design-related and experimental aspects to the design of wireless transmitters."

These antenna elements need to be ""matched"" to the radio-frequency amplifiers they are connected to, much in the way audio speakers need to be matched to amplifiers to optimize the sound of a music system.  Matching circuits can be complicated when there are many antennas in a compact device since these antennas interact and couple with each other.  Because of this coupling, any connection with one antenna disturbs the connections with neighboring antennas.  Hence, the problem of connecting amplifiers to antennas when they are closely spaced requires careful consideration and a systematic circuit design process.  Existing designs tend to be complicated, non-systematic, and difficult to implement in a compact manner; as a result, much transmitter power is lost to a poor match.  This research effort looks at simple systematic circuit designs that achieve a good match across a wide range of transmitter frequencies.  Since wireless devices are being asked to operate in many bands simultaneously and with high data rates, such circuits can yield great improvements in wireless connectivity in existing frequency bands as well as next-generation bands where the demands on the number of antennas, data rates and device performance are expected to be even more extreme.  The theory and experimental validation developed under this effort for low-complexity, high-bandwidth networks is expected to have significant impact on the performance of low-cost high-performance devices, with benefit to society at large, including applications in personal communications and medical telemetry.  The effort also has significant educational benefits since it will train an interdisciplinary mix of graduate students in topics within communications, circuits, and microwave engineering. <br/><br/>This research effort advocates the design and analysis of low-complexity high-bandwidth multiport matching networks to compensate for coupling in radio-frequency transmitters, receivers, and circuits.  The ideal multiport matching network inserted between independent sources and coupled loads compensates for the coupling by eliminating both reflected power and also power transferred from one source through a load to another source. Among the design limitations of such networks, complexity and bandwidth are usually the most important, especially for compact wideband wireless communication devices.  These limitations have not been well studied, and this effort includes an integrated two-pronged exploration of these issues in microwave and millimeter-wave matching networks.  The first prong uses network-theoretic analyses to explore systematic, unified, design methods that work for any load structure. The effort also seeks standardized limits against which network performance in both complexity and bandwidth can be measured. The second prong couples an experimental program to both validate as well as inform the modeling choices made in the design and optimization of the matching networks.  Practical issues such as undesired parasitic coupling and electromagnetic discontinuities in distributed circuit implementations will be examined.  Of particular interest are the microwave (2.4 GHz) and millimeter-wave (60 GHz) frequencies with both lumped and distributed radio-frequency components, and an emphasis on simple module layouts.  The effort is transformative because it will offer a comprehensive unified set of metrics, design criteria, and methodologies for complexity and bandwidth of multiport matching networks applicable to compact radio-frequency devices."

Advances in miniature sensors and wireless communications have opened the possibility for wearable, on-body sensors that remotely and continuously monitor physiological vital signs and transmit alerts to medical caregivers who can intervene in case of impending emergencies.  A major hurdle is that the sensors' antennas require relatively large amounts of electrical power to reliably transmit data over extended periods of time during regular daily life.  More efficient, optimized antenna designs are needed so that sensor batteries can be small and long-lasting, thereby allowing sensors to be convenient and unobtrusive.  To facilitate efficient on-body antenna designs, this project combines experimental and computer modeling methods to study and characterize how electromagnetic waves transmit over and around the moving human body.  Insights from analysis of measurement and simulation data guide the design of reconfigurable, wearable antennas that facilitate efficient, on-body wireless communication for continuous, remote health monitoring. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to study on-body electromagnetic wave propagations during human daily activities in order to guide the design of 3-D printed, reconfigurable, wearable antennas for unobtrusive, power-efficient, on-body wireless communications. Both measurement and simulation approaches are utilized in this project: i) three-dimensional body motions and complex electromagnetic transmission characteristics are simultaneously measured during common human activities for various on-body antenna configurations and in various environments; and ii) a three-dimensional modeling framework that reproduces experimental results and predicts wave transmission characteristics is established in electromagnetic simulation software. One key intellectual merit of this approach is relating on-body electromagnetic characteristics to body postures and antenna kinematics. Another key intellectual merit of the proposed work is designing and creating 3-D printed, electrically-small, reconfigurable, wearable antennas that couple radiation power into the dominant propagation mechanism. These advances will transform life-saving on-body communication technologies with applications that benefit patients, public safety officers, soldiers, and astronauts."

Current clinical practice involves taking biopsy samples from suspicious sites, followed by tissue processing and microscopic examination for abnormalities. This is a low yield, expensive, painful, and slow process. This project develops a new approach for microscopic imaging of living cells and tissues within the body in real time, which will improve the ability of physicians to detect early stage disease. The developed approach will also greatly increase the number of diagnostically useful biopsies being collected, improve the accuracy of margin identification during surgical resection, and permit non-invasive monitoring of post-surgical sites for recurrence. Lowering costs associated with unnecessary biopsies, multiple clinic visits, and repeat surgeries due to undetected residual disease will also positively impact the economics of healthcare delivery in the US.  <br/><br/>The technical focus of this project is on the design of a fiber-optic probe that will enable examination of tissue for signs of disease in real-time, non-invasively, at the level of traditional pathology. This involves breaking conventional resolution limitations in fiber-optic imaging to deliver a real-time ""optical biopsy"".  This is accomplished through integration of mathematical concepts from the compressed sensing field with hardware design and engineering for the clinical setting. The main goals of this project in this regard are (1) to design and engineer two candidate hardware architectures for optical biopsy, (2) to design, analyze and optimize the computational algorithms required to generate high-resolution images from these specific architectures, (3) to design and train automated feature recognition algorithms to assist the physician in interpreting optical biopsy images in real-time, and (4) to complete benchmark validation of the system using calibrated test targets and biological phantoms.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the tight integration between fiber-optic-based endomicroscopy and signal processing theory and algorithms. This project does not simply apply image analysis algorithms to previously-acquired data in post-processing. Instead, the optical hardware components and signal processing elements are co-designed to enable imaging at 2-4 times higher spatial resolution than possible from developing the hardware or software alone.<br/><br/>This project will thus advance the medical imaging field by developing new signal processing techniques to increase resolution and field-of-view that do not require additional breakthroughs in microfabrication methods. This project will also advance the signal processing field by introducing new algorithms to solve missing data problems, address ill-posed inverse problems, and implement compressive sensing theory, all at previously unexplored length scale.  However, the most transformative aspect of this work is that it has the potential to change clinical practices from reliance on 100 year old pathology practices to real-time information on tissue status at the patient?s bedside."

Yet more than 100 times bandwidth is available in the millimeter-wave spectrum of 30-300 GHz, offering the potential of huge increases in data rates for next generation devices. Currently, there are several challenges for successful realization of millimeter-wave communication systems. One such challenge is that the signal propagation at millimeter-wave frequencies is impaired by severe path loss. Natural approach to counter the increased path loss at higher frequency bands is to use transmitting and receiving beamforming networks with many antennas per terminal. As a result, it is highly desirable to develop high-efficiency and high-gain integrated circuit antenna arrays operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. Potential applications for the proposed arrays include millimeter-wave short-range communication links, satellite communications, radars, remote sensing, security, and medical imaging. This research will not only advance the research of advanced miniaturized antenna arrays but also support curriculum development at The Ohio State University in the area of RF microsystems. The PIs will advise undergraduate researchers through capstone design projects and independent studies intended to harness the unique features of millimeter-wave antennas, electrical characterization of materials, 3D printed meta-material surfaces, and microfabrication processes. Other educational impact includes hands-on experiences to train students in wireless technologies through summer camps and a variety of outreach activities to attract undergraduates and underrepresented students in engineering. <br/><br/>One major drawback of current millimeter-wave technologies adopted for integration of arrays on silicon is the low efficiency (5-10%) and consequently low realized gain. Therefore, the central objective of this proposal is to develop scanning arrays on silicon integrated circuits that exhibit radiation efficiency of greater than 85%. Such compact high-efficiency millimeter-wave arrays have not been realized to date. Moreover, steerable millimeter-wave antenna arrays are well suited to meet the needs for next-generation high data-rate communications. This research aims to understand and address fundamental limitations in efficiency of integrated circuit antennas. The proposed approach for increasing low radiation efficiency and low gain is interdisciplinary and utilizes hybrid fabrication approach: a) suspended radiating elements using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process, and b) 3D-printed artificial (anisotropic) dielectric layers. By suspending all radiating elements of a phased array in air using MEMS fabrication processes, the lossy silicon substrate is removed. In addition, a 3D-printed dielectric lens or meta-material layer is fabricated above the radiating elements to enhance the scanning volume of the phased array. As a complementary fabrication technique, additive manufacturing such as 3D printing is uniquely suited for millimeter-wave arrays where the wavelengths are in the range of a few millimeters. The integration of antenna with integrated circuits - combined with enhancements in scanning volume, gain, and bandwidth delivered by artificial dielectric layer - provide enormous advantage in miniaturization of the systems and is essential for next-generation active electronic-scanning arrays. This novel and interdisciplinary approach is potentially transformative to integrated circuit antennas."

This change has been accompanied by an increasing demand for higher speed wireless communication. Wireless Terabit-per-second links are expected to become a reality within the next ten years. Towards this aim, the Terahertz Band (0.1-10 THz) communication is envisioned as one of the key wireless technologies of the next decade. The THz band will help to overcome the spectrum scarcity problems and capacity limitations of current wireless networks, by providing an unprecedentedly large bandwidth. In addition, THz-band communication will enable a plethora of long-awaited applications ranging from instantaneous massive data transfer among nearby devices in Terabit Wireless Personal and Local Area Networks, to ultra-high-definition content streaming over mobile devices in 5G and beyond small cells. Nevertheless, there are several research challenges from the very-high and frequency-selective path loss of the THz-band channel and the very limited distance, which require innovative solutions and the revision of well-established concepts in wireless communication.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to pave the way for the development of ultra-broadband communication in the THz band. THz technology and its applications has been recently identified by DARPA as one of the four with a potential broader impact larger than the Internet itself. Ultra-broadband communication will play a major role in the society by drastically increasing the capacity of wireless networks and enabling long-awaited applications not possible with current wireless technologies. In addition, the THz band is not yet regulated. The project team is actively involved in IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Network Terahertz Task Group, whose objective is to create the first standard for this paradigm. In this project, one graduate student will be supported, and master students (as special topic students) will be involved, to become experts in this fast evolving field. The research results will be disseminated in important, first rate scientific conferences, journals and premier magazines in the field. Moreover, the proposed solutions in this project can be tailored and are useful for the lower frequencies such as the millimeter-wave systems, which can help the development progress of 5G cellular systems.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to strengthen the theoretical foundations of ultra- broadband communications in the THz band and bring the Terabit-per-second links one-step closer to reality. Our targeted breakthrough is to increase the capacity of wireless systems to reach Terabit-per-second and overcome the spectrum scarcity and capacity limitations of current wireless networks. This project will make contributions along three major thrusts. First, the concept of ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output is introduced to overcome the distance limitation, based on the use of the very large antenna arrays with thousands of antenna elements. The dynamic operation modes that include beamforming, spatial multiplexing and a combination of both, as well as the multi-band ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output will be analyzed. Second, accurate models for the three-dimensional end-to-end channel, and the three-dimensional ultra-massive multiple-input-multiple-output channel will be developed, which will provide physical insights and the guidelines for the THz band communication design. Third, by capturing the unique channel peculiarities, distance-adaptive resource allocation, and low-sampling-rate and multi-carrier synchronization schemes will be investigated for THz band communications."

Often these devices function due to an applied flow of electrons, and this charge flow generates heat.  In many cases this heat limits the performance of these tiny devices and prevents gains in technology.  This project aims to explore ways to simultaneously avoid or exploit this heating by study of thermal effects in a particular nanoscale metallic magnetic device known as a non-local spin valve.  These devices are already known to allow generation of flows of angular momentum, or spin, in a metallic nanowire with no associated charge flow.   However, their operation usually requires large applied electron flows in other elements of the device.  The main motivation of this work is to provide the transformative knowledge of thermal effects in these devices that could eventually allow operation with only applied heat, eliminating the charge flow altogether.  This will enable simplification and further size reduction in future devices that could significantly advance data storage and other technologies.<br/><br/>The metallic non-local spin valve is an invaluable, though still not thoroughly understood, device for producing and studying pure spin currents. The use of charge currents to produce spin currents in the NLSV was achieved ~15 years ago, and these sensors are poised to play an important role in near-term magnetic recording. However, the electrical injection of spin causes significant heating and thermoelectric effects that strongly affect the performance of the sensors are not yet well characterized and understood. The demonstration of spin injection in the non-local spin valve via purely thermal effects is of even greater interest. These very recent and novel measurements point the way toward implementation of such sensors without the large charge current, which offer many advantages for the ever smaller and more sensitive sensors or more efficient sources demanded by the information technology community.  This project takes advantage of unique expertise in creating and measuring thermal gradients and in measuring Seebeck and Peltier effects in nanoscale systems to understand and control heat and spin flow in metallic nanomagnetic devices. The unique ability to directly measure the thermal properties (thermal conductivity, Seebeck, and Peltier coefficients) of the thin film constituents of nanoscale devices using micromachined thermal isolation platforms is a central focus of the project. By removing the bulk substrate from beneath a nanoscale device or thin film, the uncertainty in the direction of heat flow is dramatically reduced, modeling the structure via finite element methods becomes much simpler, and engineering the thermal gradients applied to the nanoscale structures is possible. Specific tasks include: 1) Understanding interface and materials dependence of the spin-dependent Seebeck effect and the absolute Seebeck effect, 2) the Search for magnon-drag contributions, 3) Studies of thermoelectric effects and the spin injection in ""zero substrate"" devices, and 4) Thermally engineering response of sensors via external thermal gradients."

Because a significant portion of the mobile data traffic is delay-sensitive, future cellular networks will face the dual challenge of supporting large traffic volumes and providing reliable service for delay-sensitive applications. On the other hand, wireless community across the globe is facing severe spectrum shortage. The goal of this project is to maximize the spectrum utilization efficiency and guarantee quality of service for delay-sensitive hybrid broadcast/unicast traffic by studying new collaborative spectrum sharing and resource allocation technologies for heterogeneous cellular networks.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: <br/>This project defines new performance metrics that can accurately measure the spectrum utilization efficiency as well as the quality of service requirements of delay-sensitive wireless traffic. In particular, the concept of hybrid rate region is defined to simultaneously characterize the broadcast outage capacity and unicast effective capacity. To maximize the hybrid rate region, a two-pronged approach is proposed to achieve a synthesis of pragmatism and fundamentally new principles to systems engineering. The proposed research activities are streamlined into two mutually supportive thrusts: (1) maximize the hybrid rate region for the single-cell cellular network using both orthogonal and non-orthogonal spectrum sharing technologies; (2) maximize the hybrid rate region for a multi-cell heterogeneous cellular network where macro base stations and low power relay nodes are overlaid in the coverage area. The project outcomes include enabling spectrum sharing and resource allocation technologies that are heavily dependent on the delay-sensitivity of the underlying traffic, and characterization of optimal network topology for heterogeneous cellular networks with hybrid broadcast/unicast traffic.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The project addresses the worldwide spectrum shortage for broadband cellular network. It has potential impact on emerging wireless industrial standards and practices, such that the research outputs will likely influence and transform, rather than follow, scientific and technological trends. Meanwhile, the PIs will recruit students of underrepresented groups in Kentucky and Kansas, including Native American, female, low incoming and first generation students to participate in the project. By collaborating with the McNair program, the PIs will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in electrical engineering."

However, these memories cannot be scaled to very small sizes, i.e. they are low-capacity, and/or they lose their contents when the power is off, i.e. they are volatile.  Existing high-capacity non-volatile memories, such as solid-state hard drives, must typically be situated away from the processing unit. As a result, it takes extra time for a processing unit to fetch data, process them and store them back. Furthermore, most non-volatile memories can only be erased and written a finite number of times. An ultimate memory should be suitable to be embedded in all systems. The desired features of this memory include non-volatility, low-power operation, infinite endurance, large on-off ratios, excellent write-error rates, nanosecond writing time, sub-nanosecond reading time, and good scalability.<br/><br/>This project uses an interdisciplinary approach spanning materials, devices, circuits and architectures to realize such a memory and paradigm-shifting in-memory-processing architectures. The outcome will be durable, energy-efficient, pausable processing in polymorphic memories (DEEP3M), where computational capabilities are pushed directly into the high-capacity memories enabling massively parallel computation with fast and energy-efficient memory access. This approach builds on recent breakthroughs in physics of magnetic switching and advanced materials, and enables a transformative, holistic exploration of processing and memory by re-imaging the memory device as a computing element itself.

Flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion-corrosion are among the most common degradation modes of the steel piping. One of the maintenance paradigms to mitigate the risks of structural failures consists of measuring the thickness of pipe walls periodically, at predefined locations using conventional nondestructive evaluation methods. However, this maintenance strategy can do little when flaws are induced or become critical between two maintenance inspections. In addition, the intricate network of pipes, some of which operating at very high temperature, makes periodic inspection neither trivial nor inexpensive. In this project, we propose a new transduction mechanism that can be used to monitor continuously the pipes of interests. The transducer consists of four main components: a chain of a few millimeter spherical particles able to sustain the propagation of highly nonlinear solitary waves; a mechanism to trigger the waves in the chain; an embedded sensor to detect the waves; a hardware system to process in-situ the data and transmit valuable information wirelessly. The research hypothesis is that certain characteristics of the waves are dependent on the thickness of the pipe. If the hypothesis will be validated, the new transducer will allow the continuous monitoring of the structure of interest without plant shutdown, and will not suffer from data fidelity due to high-temperature operation or variability associated with coupling mechanism.  Ultimately, the proposed transducer shall enable the remote measurement of the wall thickness of pipes operating at any temperature and at any location, above and below ground. While studying the fundamental principles of this new transducer to address the engineering problem of pipe bursts, the investigators will explore the feasibility of the transducer, opportunely downscaled and designed, at measuring the intraocular pressure of the human eye. The objective is to allow glaucoma patients to perform frequent self-measurement of their intraocular pressure without the burden of clinical visits. This will benefit the millions of patients that suffer from glaucoma, an age-related disease and the second leading cause of blindness in the world. To this end, this project represents the initial step towards the development of a new portable tonometer for self-measurements to allow glaucoma patients capturing the spontaneous circadian rhythm of the eye pressure.<br/><br/>The two main technological innovations that are expected from the scientific advancements of this project are: (1) a new transducer for the remote measurement of metallic pipe thickness operating at any temperature and at any location; and (2) a new trans-palpebral tonometer to perform self-measurements anywhere anytime. The research team is formed by an expert in solitary wave propagation and nondestructive evaluation an expert in the electronic development of electrochemical sensors and an eye care professional with experience in glaucoma and cataract surgery. A graduate student and a post-doc will work on the project. Many graduates and undergraduates will be impacted as well,  a plan to incorporate a few laboratory sessions in their cross-listed courses.

Fluorescence is exhibited by many compounds and materials and provides information about the objects' molecular makeup and microstructure. While not usually directly visible to the eye, it can be made visible using controlled illumination and optical filters. The fast response of fluorescence to illumination is visible only to special ultrafast cameras. Interpretation of these signals significantly enhances conventional imaging capabilities, for example to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue, detect blood and other bodily fluids, assess plant health, match gunshot residue to a gun and gunpowder manufacturer, identify the paints used in paintings, and classify minerals. However, capturing the fluorescence spectra for all different possible illumination wavelengths along with their fast temporal behavior for each pixel in an image would lead to a high dimensional dataset involving immense amounts of data and is therefore impractical. To enable the use of fluorescence, this project therefore will design a flexible computational imaging system that is able to selectively and adaptively capture individual pieces of the multidimensional fluorescence signal.<br/><br/><br/>Intellectual Merit The high resolution information available in the optical light field along<br/>multiple dimensions presents a fundamental challenge to all imaging systems.

Ignoring this uncertainty typically leads to inferior solutions that perform poorly in practice due to the notorious flaw of averages, whereby plans based on the assumption that average conditions pre-vail are usually wrong. These decision problems are often also dynamic in nature they span across multiple time stages and involve high dimensional non-anticipative recourse decisions which further increase the problem complexity. Thus, effective and efficient solution schemes for these decision problems are highly desirable. Traditional solution schemes, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are extremely challenging to solve. Recent advances in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have been successful in mitigating the intractability of various single-stage decision problems under uncertainty. In DRO, we seek a decision that performs best in view of the most adverse distribution of uncertain parameters that is consistent with the available statistical and structural information. Thus, DRO not only improves computational tractability but also alleviates the overfitting effects characteristic of the traditional solution schemes. By leveraging and inventing new techniques in DRO, the proposed research work aims to significantly advance the state-of-the-art methodologies for addressing the challenges of dynamic decision problems and to initiate the effort for industrial-size applications. The research outputs of this work will have a significant and immediate practical impact on important applications in energy, engineering, machine learning, operations management, finance, etc., and on learning problems in robotics and automatic control. This CAREER work will also advance the state of pedagogy by developing an integrated curriculum that bridges the gap between the deep theory of decision-making under uncertainty and the real-life practice. The proposed curriculum is aimed at future practitioners and researchers, and is designed to equip these experts with the analytical skills and tools to deal with real-life decision-making problems under uncertainty.<br/><br/>The proposed research work is aimed at addressing a major gap in the theory and practice of decision-making under uncertainty. It concentrates on four main research thrusts: 1) Derive exact mixed-integer conic programming (MICP) reformulations for convex dynamic problems as well as for dynamic problems with discrete decisions 2) Deal with the case of endogenous uncertainty whose representation depends explicitly on the chosen decisions 3) Systematically integrate data into the description of uncertainty. Obtain provable out-of-sample performance guarantees from the resulting data-driven DRO models 4) Derive exact MICP reformulations for inverse optimization problems in the dynamic setting. The proposed research effort endeavors to develop more powerful solution schemes which leverage standard off-the-shelf MICP solvers for various intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty. The work will establish a new connection between generic dynamic DRO models and renowned classes of mixed-integer conic programs. The resulting connection will give us a better understanding of the inherent difficulty of the decision problems and enable us to derive attractive performance guarantees for the new solution schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

THz waves are extremely high frequency signals (100 GHz 10 THz) that enable unique imaging capabilities. Unless looking into a well-polished surface, human eyes and regular cameras can only discern objects that are in the line of sight, therefore an object located around a corner is not visible. On the other hand, terahertz (THz) waves exhibit strong reflections from common building surfaces. Using THz cameras walls or doors can appear as mirrors, thus allowing to peek inside rooms and cavities otherwise hidden from direct sight. Such capability will augment vision and situational awareness of first responders and rescuers in unreachable and uncharted environments. Interestingly, non-line-sight imaging capabilities could be leveraged from the next generation of ultra-fast wireless communication systems. Future communication systems will be equipped with antennas that can operate as cameras and transfer data. The synergy of THz communications and imaging will enable uninterrupted links and user mobility. Additionally, non-line-of-sight imaging will enable localization of users with centimeter-level accuracy for applications in virtual/augmented reality or assisted healthcare. The proposed project will also emphasize on educating a broader audience of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. With the use of augmented reality headsets, the students will implement software that allows the visualization of THz imaging capabilities in the real-world. Additionally, the PI will collaborate with local first responders and military veterans to educate them through workshops on the capabilities and opportunities of the new imaging technology.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to design image reconstruction algorithms and hardware topologies that will enable real-time, 3D THz imaging of both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) objects from a single observation point. The five-year career-development plan has the following objectives: 1) Analyze the mechanisms that distort images in multipath imaging and implement algorithms to invert the process for accurate image reconstruction. 2) Design topologies for NLoS THz imaging and understand the requirements for communication and imaging coexistence. 3) Implement methods for simultaneous localization and mapping and synergy between imaging and communication protocols for efficient channel estimation. The intellectual merit of this work is to understand wavefront distortions of THz waves in multipath and multi-reflection scenarios and use this knowledge to implement inverse scattering methods to reconstruct images from backscattered signals. This knowledge will also help us understand the hardware imaging requirements and how NLoS imaging can collaborate with communication hardware for novel applications. Using the 3D images of the surrounding, the proposed research will provide a new approach for channel estimation for the next generation of ultrafast wireless communications. In the long term, this research will contribute to the national security by enabling first response, surveillance and reconnaissance in hostile and uncharted environment, allow autonomous navigation in crowed spaces, and provide a path for the integration of imaging and communications for faster wireless data transmission.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared with conventional digital beamforming, the proposed solution is advantageous in lower hardware cost, less power consumption and lower circuit complexity. In addition, a hybrid-mode localization mechanism will be devised to fuse the advantages of Doppler/interferometry, frequency shift keying (FSK), and FMCW detection modes, so that the spectrum usage and signal processing load are kept to the minimum by switching the detection mode based on the status of the targets. The system will further reduce spectrum usage by user-centered operation, which efficiently senses and tracks human subjects based on human motion characteristics. Special localization algorithms will be derived to identify the unique human behavior that is distinct from other objects. The project will actively involve K-12 and undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to its intermittency, volatility, and uncertainty, wind power generation has posed grand challenges for power system operations and planning. This project aims at addressing key challenges in wind power integration, including reserve procurement, wind power ramps, and involuntary wind power curtailment. The research of this project will produce the following: 1) a systematic approach for risk assessment and quantification of wind power ramps; 2) an early alarm system for large wind power ramps induced by extreme weather events; and 3) cost-effective operational protocols for acquiring reserves from generation and transmission resources of power networks. The research outcomes will be integrated to develop new multidisciplinary courses to enrich the curriculum of wind engineering program at the National Wind Institute, and to engage undergraduate students in research through design and experimental projects at a dedicated wind power research laboratory that is to be established as an outcome of the project. The project outcomes are expected to impact power system operations by enhancing the operator's situational awareness of wind power ramps, and by improving the reliability, security, and efficiency of bulk power systems and the wholesale electricity market. The integrated research and educational activities will contribute to training qualified engineers and researchers who can contribute to a thriving and sustainable wind energy industry.<br/><br/><br/>The project research seeks fundamental breakthroughs in wind power ramp risk assessment and curtailment reduction to enable efficient utilization of increased wind power capacity in bulk power systems. Motivated by a key observation that large wind power ramps exhibit tail behaviors dictated by generalized Pareto distributions, a systematic method for quantifying wind power ramp risk is developed, based on which the adequate amount of reserves can be determined in a rigorous manner. Along a different path, preliminary studies using real-world data from Mesonet and dispersed wind farms reveal that Mesonet measurements indeed contain critical signatures of large wind power ramps induced by extreme weather events (fronts, thunderstorms, icing events, etc.), which state-of-the-art wind power forecasting systems may fail to capture. With this insight, a Mesonet-based early alarm system will be designed to enhance the power system operator's risk awareness with respect to large wind power ramps. Further, an innovative concept of line transfer margin will be developed from a congestion risk-limiting viewpoint, which facilitates reduction of involuntary wind power curtailment by suppressing congestion risk and by improving the deliverability of reserves. These line transfer margins can be easily pre-computed by using basic statistical information on nodal wind power generation together with the flow distribution factors of power networks. The research encompasses several innovative and nontraditional approaches, including risk quantification of wind power ramps using extreme value theory, wind power ramp events detection through networked data analytics, and exploratory study of dynamic reserve zoning from a graph-theoretic perspective."

New mobile applications with advanced features are being created every day and finding their way into our lives. However, this trend toward omnipotent mobile Internet is hampered by the fact that mobile devices, compared to their desktop counterparts, are inherently resource-poor, due to limited computing power and battery lifetime. As a result, there exists a tussle between computation-intensive applications and resource-poor mobile devices. Recently, a mobile cloud computing paradigm  is emerging and is capable of answering the needs of computation-intensive mobile applications, and reflects the principal investigator's vision of carry small enjoy large: carry a small mobile device while enjoying a large amount of resources offered by cloud computing infrastructure. Under this paradigm, a small mobile device can deliver a rich experience of computing, telephony, multimedia, entertainment, gaming, and Internet.<br/><br/>To realize the vision of carry small enjoy large, this project is intended to develop new theories and techniques with the promise of significantly advancing the current technologies of mobile cloud computing.  To accomplish this, the following research tasks will be conducted: 1)  developing a computing-task scheduling approach based on Markov decision process and effective capacity, which is capable of achieving optimal energy consumption while guaranteeing user-specified task-completion delay performance over fading channels; 2)  designing a data-prefetch scheduler for mobile video streaming, which minimizes the cost incurred by unconsumed video data while satisfying the viewer's quality of experience; 3) designing a resource-optimized  video codec that guarantees low delay and high quality of experience for gaming video; and 4) developing a  real-time wireless testbed. <br/><br/>The proposed approaches will fill some important gaps in fundamental understanding of mobile cloud computing and networking over time-varying fading channels, and will provide the theoretical underpinning for system design and algorithm implementation. The proposed approach to computing-task scheduling will not only provide an enabling technology that realizes our vision of carry small enjoy large, but also push the frontier of green computing technologies.  The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, and attract students from underrepresented groups. The mobile cloud computing applications will offer an ideal platform to engage undergraduate and K-12 students with enhanced education and research experience.<br/><br/>The transformative aspect of the project is that the proposed research on mobile cloud computing will result in new methodologies for the design of mobile video streaming systems and cloud gaming systems with unprecedented capabilities of achieving optimal resource usage and high quality of experience."

In emerging systems such as fifth-generation (5G) networks, the use of mmW frequencies will potentially enable unprecedented improvements in network capacity, mobility, and spectral efficiency. However, the exploitation of mmW bands requires solutions to many technical challenges. In particular, the technology limitations present in today's implementations require new paradigms in algorithms, signal processing methods, circuit architectures, and integration methods in order for 5G wireless to become a reality. For example, there is a need for advanced channel models that let designers implement the wireless network infrastructure of the future. There is also a need for new algorithms, software, hardware, and electronic circuits for efficient mmW antenna array processing. This project will exploit well-known physics arising from Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, namely the causality light-cone, to significantly improve the performance of key array signal processing components in mmW wireless basestations. Specifically, the spatio-temporal properties of electromagnetic waves, as described by Special Relativity, are exploited in novel architectures to improve the energy efficiency, reduce the noise, and improve the linearity of array receivers. A system-wide study of spatio-temporal properties of mmW channels is combined with these architectures to design new types of mmW array receivers and optimum beam forming algorithms. <br/><br/>The Special Theory of Relativity describes a region in the multidimensional spacetime continuum that is not occupied by propagating waves due to the constant speed of light and the nature of the wave equation. As a result, the region of support (ROS) of all propagating waves, which correspond to wireless propagation channels, are confined inside a ``Light Cone''. The region of spacetime outside this cone (known as ``Elsewhere'') is a void within which wireless communications signals cannot propagate. Although devoid of waves, the Elsewhere is occupied by both electronic noise and nonlinear distortion arising from real-world amplifiers and data converters. The project explores the possibility of spatially over-sampling the mmW antenna arrays and thereafter applying multidimensional extensions of well-known sigma-delta modulation techniques across both discrete space and continuous-time dimensions to achieve noise and distortion shaping, which effectively move  the  unwanted received components into Elsewhere.  Although sigma-delta algorithms have been employed in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), it is here proposed that multidimensional extensions of these algorithms are not limited to just ADCs; rather, it is possible to apply these algorithms to low-noise amplifiers, ADCs and other circuit components used in arrays, which in turn leads to the creation of new concepts in multi-dimensional circuit theory for array processing. The technique is expected to lead to improved amplifier noise figure and linearity and exponentially improved ADC figure-of-merit for array digitization at a linear cost in the number of antennas and receivers. The resulting mmW array processors have applications in wireless communications, phased-array radar, and radio telescope antenna apertures. The project is a multi-institutional collaboration between four universities in Ohio and New York, and has multiple education and community outreach activities, which will be implemented via the annual Brooklyn 5G Summit. The project includes mentoring for female engineers and students, development of new educational material, and engagement of underrepresented groups in wireless communications topics. Outreach will be achieved through community activities, workshops, the Brooklyn 5G Summit including events for women in 5G, and scientific outreach and academic events organized within IEEE conferences. The mmW circuits research and education program combines theory with hands-on system prototyping. Industry engagement, which is critically important for emerging wireless technologies, is planned throughout the project, and facilitated via the annual Brooklyn 5G Summit. Open source models, designs and prototype chips will be offered to the public and wireless industry."

They also bypass the need for invasive sample extraction and labor-intensive laboratory analysis. Along these lines, this proposal demonstrates a capsule-microsystem with sensors and integrated electronic components for monitoring and wirelessly sharing the diagnostics on pancreatic health. The sensors will be fabricated by standard lithographic processes and integrated with bio-materials, sensitive to the pancreatic secretions. The two biomaterials of choice will be (i) single-strand microRNA (Ribo-Nucleic Acid) sequences that bind to microRNA markers secreted by pancreatic cells; and (ii) thin films of naturally-derived macromolecules, such as starch, polypeptides, and triglycerides, that can be digested by pancreatic amylase, protease, and lipase. These biomaterials will be interfaced with capacitance and impedance based electrical sensors, encapsulated within the ingestible capsule. The capsule skeleton will be 3D printed with a bio-compatible polymer. As the sensors are exposed to pancreatic secretions in the gut, they will collected diagnostic data in real-time and transmit it wirelessly to the connected devices. The fabrication of sensing systems utilizing these technologies can provide location specific data on an array of analytes for a better understanding of the complex biological interactions triggering a disease process. This knowledge will lead to effective early detection strategies for the pancreatic health and other pathological disorders of the gut. In addition to co-advising and training one graduate student, this capsule technology and its parallels to the film the Fantastic Voyage will be used to capture general public's imagination, serving as a basis for many stimulating and educational outreach activities. <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to demonstrate an ingestible wireless capsule system capable of in situ sensing of enzyme and microRNA biomarkers in the gastrointestinal tract for pancreatic health monitoring. Capsule technologies do exist, but no ingestible technology is currently available that allows for sensing of specific biomolecular analytes within targeted regions within the gut. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma manifests in the form of chemical and biomolecular changes in pancreatic secretions. However, these secretions are difficult to access as they are emptied into the duodenum via the pancreatic duct, and there is currently no method for effectively indicating early stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The proposed device involves impedance and capacitive sensing of material degradation or marker probe functionalization over electrodes in response to analyte exposure and specific reactivity. The materials consist of naturally-derived macromolecules, such as starch, polypeptides, and triglycerides, that have been deposited in the form of thin films that are digested by pancreatic amylases, proteases, and lipases, respectively. The probes are single-strand microRNA sequences functionalized on an electrode surface that bind to microRNA markers secreted by pancreatic cells. The electrical signals described above are read and transmitted via a network of components, including an analog-to-digital converter, a Bluetooth low-energy chip, a low power timer integrated circuit, and a lithium polymer battery. The packaging consists of a 3D-printed biocompatible capsule, with micromesh structures for retaining polymers that dissolve at a specified pH, thereby allowing for GI location targeting. This tool represents a foundation for sensing systems based on the biodegradation of polymer coatings, biomarker detection, microelectronics integration, and packaging. The developed system serves as a platform for a variety of other sensing applications and paves the way for the design of smaller ingestible or implantable systems for use in various segments within the body."

Higher data rates, though, are generally achieved by using higher frequencies. One area of the electromagnetic spectrum that uniquely fits this purpose is called the millimeter-wave band. This band refers to wavelengths in the order of a few millimeters. Specifically, the millimeter-wave band is defined as frequencies between 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Reconfigurability and adaptability is a vital feature of future agile millimeter-wave systems for sensing, imaging, and wireless communications. However, when radio-frequency systems are made reconfigurable, they become lossy neutralizing any gain achieved by reconfiguration. In other words, despite the added functionality, losses (low efficiencies) are the Achilles heel of any radio-frequency reconfigurable system often less discussed. This project intends to address aforementioned fundamental limitation. The proposed research fosters fundamental studies on phase-change materials and their applications in the millimeter-wave domain, specifically, passive imaging sensors. The proposed research can open doors in millimeter-wave and beyond. Applications of the proposed millimeter-wave sensors include medical imaging, navigation, remote sensing, and robotics among a few. In addition to research, the education plan of this project includes: 1) develop new courses at the Ohio State University, 2) undergraduate and K-12 summer program, and 3) participation in outreach program for underserved students from Central Ohio. Broader impacts of this project include broadening participation of underrepresented groups and undergraduate research. <br/><br/>Phase-change materials are attractive choices for millimeter-wave reconfiguration as they provide a path to achieve low-loss microsystems. Unique feature of phase-change material is non-linear or abrupt change in physical (i.e. electrical or optical) properties such as permittivity or refractive index with temperature, strain, and current. Metal oxides such as vanadium dioxide belong to a sub-group of phase-change materials that exhibit reversible metal-insulator transition. These materials provide a path for realization of low-loss radio-frequency microsystems. As a result, the main objectives of the proposed research are 1) to understand and analyze the correlation between film deposition conditions and the electrical properties (complex permittivity) of phase-change materials in the millimeter-wave band including losses. Successful demonstration of such unique properties, hinges upon understanding film growth conditions and their impact on crystal structure; 2) study and exploit new strain-induced excitation (activation) techniques on suspended millimeter-wave structures and analyze their impact on device performance; 3) explore novel device architecture, especially, using selected phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide or other candidates, to reduce or eliminate losses while achieving unique functionalities. A new class of passive imaging arrays (millimeter-wave camera) is expected to exhibit significantly higher responsivity in this band than the state-of-the-art sensors. In addition to the fundamental studies, the proposed work is ambitious but potentially transformative as it challenges the conventional wisdom in designing sensors and dominance of semiconductor-based millimeter-wave detectors. Currently, no acceptable solution is available for millimeter-wave imaging systems operating at the room temperature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They must adapt to manage a set of highly uncertain and distributed resources such as electric vehicles and solar PVs, while at the same time operating a grid infrastructure that was designed decades ago. These challenges are particularly acute in the distribution system, where the networks are traditionally not monitored closely, and operators lack the essential information to obtain an accurate real-time operational state of the system. At the same time, the number of outages in distribution systems has started to increase as the system ages, and the loads become more dynamic. The goal of this proposal is to overcome these challenges by developing novel algorithms and new insights that increase the efficiency and resilience of the distribution systems.

The main participants are The College of Staten Island (CSI/CUNY), Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU), and The City College of New York (CCNY/CUNY). It will also involve an international collaboration with the University of Zaragoza (UZ), Spain, and a GOALI component with the world-leader in avionics, The Boeing Co. Avionic communication systems are currently undergoing a radical transformation in both the commercial and military sectors. The former (commercial), the focus of this project, exhibits an increasing need for high-speed communication due to emerging applications for the traveling public, as well as higher operational needs for the ultra-modern aircraft that are being deployed. In addition, aging aircraft wiring poses a significant threat to aircrafts, as electrical wires have proven to be one of the major factors leading to airplane failures. Therefore, there is an ongoing migration of avionic data buses from copper to fiber-based networks, since the latter exhibit high transmission capacity and high electromagnetic immunity. The investigators have suggested POF as a suitable transmission medium for next-generation avionic communication systems on commercial aircrafts due to its ease of handling, light weight and high tolerance to vibration, among other benefits. While experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of high-speed data transmission over different types of POFs, the modeling and simulation of POF-based systems is lagging behind. Therefore, the investigators will develop a comprehensive set of components and simulation techniques that empower engineers to systematically explore different designs before settling on a final custom solution for their particular system. They will also make a special effort to involve women and underrepresented groups in the effort since they traditionally are not exposed to avionic systems engineering.  <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to study the use of POF in an airplane environment with an emphasis on system performance and high bit rate transmissions. Glass fiber has a number of problems when used as a transmission medium in short-reach networks such as avionic networks. It is mechanically weak and generally lacks bending ability. Also, the core diameter of single-mode glass optical fiber is small (~10mm) and it requires very precise handling techniques. Plastic optical fiber (POF), even with its high loss (~100-300 dB/km) and diffusion, can solve these problems since it is easier to handle and has a bending radius of about 5 mm, which can be a big benefit in avionics networks. Its larger core diameter (50 mm to 1 mm) enables easy connections using inexpensive connectors. The increased core diameter allows higher tolerance to vibrations and to dust particles that can totally obstruct light propagation in glass fibers. The investigators will cover three different types of POF: large-core (up to 1 mm) step-index plastic optical fiber (SI-POF), multicore step-index plastic optical fiber (MC SI-POF), and graded-index plastic optical fiber (GI-POF). There are existing simulation models that capture all the guided modes in multimode fibers with detailed spatial fields; however, they are not adequate for large-core fibers, where there are millions of propagation modes. The project intends to develop computationally-efficient models that circumvent the need for prohibitively long simulation times and excessive computer memory. The model validation, a critical component of the project, will be done via a combination of the state-of-the-art device characterization laboratory at the University of Zaragoza and a testbed at the College of Staten Island. Montana State University will primarily work on advanced modulation formats and digital signal processing algorithms. Boeing Co. will provide prototype devices and realistic system designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike existing approaches (e.g., biometric-based approaches), the proposed authentication system does not require additional hardware, error reconciliation process and bit synchronization, and thus is suitable for resource-constrained and capacity-limited medical sensor nodes in WBANs. The proposed research tasks include (1) theoretical studies; (2) design of key agreement schemes; (3) development of message authentication system; and (4) system implementation and validation. The theoretical studies focus on the connections between the channel reciprocity, channel dependency and key generation. Based on the results of theoretical studies, practical key agreement schemes that use a set of dynamic wireless channel features among the communication partners will be developed. The project will then design a lightweight authentication system that is adaptive to wireless channels for securing medical data transmission in WBANs. Finally, the project will implement the proposed physical layer security approach in a real resource-constrained WBANs system and investigate the practical system performance limit through experiments. The findings from the project can provide guidelines for physical-channel based security system design and deployment of WBAN applications."

Because a significant portion of the mobile data traffic is delay-sensitive, future cellular networks will face the dual challenge of supporting large traffic volumes and providing reliable service for delay-sensitive applications. On the other hand, wireless community across the globe is facing severe spectrum shortage. The goal of this project is to maximize the spectrum utilization efficiency and guarantee quality of service for delay-sensitive hybrid broadcast/unicast traffic by studying new collaborative spectrum sharing and resource allocation technologies for heterogeneous cellular networks.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits: <br/>This project defines new performance metrics that can accurately measure the spectrum utilization efficiency as well as the quality of service requirements of delay-sensitive wireless traffic. In particular, the concept of hybrid rate region is defined to simultaneously characterize the broadcast outage capacity and unicast effective capacity. To maximize the hybrid rate region, a two-pronged approach is proposed to achieve a synthesis of pragmatism and fundamentally new principles to systems engineering. The proposed research activities are streamlined into two mutually supportive thrusts: (1) maximize the hybrid rate region for the single-cell cellular network using both orthogonal and non-orthogonal spectrum sharing technologies; (2) maximize the hybrid rate region for a multi-cell heterogeneous cellular network where macro base stations and low power relay nodes are overlaid in the coverage area. The project outcomes include enabling spectrum sharing and resource allocation technologies that are heavily dependent on the delay-sensitivity of the underlying traffic, and characterization of optimal network topology for heterogeneous cellular networks with hybrid broadcast/unicast traffic.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>The project addresses the worldwide spectrum shortage for broadband cellular network. It has potential impact on emerging wireless industrial standards and practices, such that the research outputs will likely influence and transform, rather than follow, scientific and technological trends. Meanwhile, the PIs will recruit students of underrepresented groups in Kentucky and Kansas, including Native American, female, low incoming and first generation students to participate in the project. By collaborating with the McNair program, the PIs will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in electrical engineering."

The main participants are The College of Staten Island (CSI/CUNY), Montana State University-Bozeman (MSU), and The City College of New York (CCNY/CUNY). It will also involve an international collaboration with the University of Zaragoza (UZ), Spain, and a GOALI component with the world-leader in avionics, The Boeing Co. Avionic communication systems are currently undergoing a radical transformation in both the commercial and military sectors. The former (commercial), the focus of this project, exhibits an increasing need for high-speed communication due to emerging applications for the traveling public, as well as higher operational needs for the ultra-modern aircraft that are being deployed. In addition, aging aircraft wiring poses a significant threat to aircrafts, as electrical wires have proven to be one of the major factors leading to airplane failures. Therefore, there is an ongoing migration of avionic data buses from copper to fiber-based networks, since the latter exhibit high transmission capacity and high electromagnetic immunity. The investigators have suggested POF as a suitable transmission medium for next-generation avionic communication systems on commercial aircrafts due to its ease of handling, light weight and high tolerance to vibration, among other benefits. While experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of high-speed data transmission over different types of POFs, the modeling and simulation of POF-based systems is lagging behind. Therefore, the investigators will develop a comprehensive set of components and simulation techniques that empower engineers to systematically explore different designs before settling on a final custom solution for their particular system. They will also make a special effort to involve women and underrepresented groups in the effort since they traditionally are not exposed to avionic systems engineering.  <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to study the use of POF in an airplane environment with an emphasis on system performance and high bit rate transmissions. Glass fiber has a number of problems when used as a transmission medium in short-reach networks such as avionic networks. It is mechanically weak and generally lacks bending ability. Also, the core diameter of single-mode glass optical fiber is small (~10mm) and it requires very precise handling techniques. Plastic optical fiber (POF), even with its high loss (~100-300 dB/km) and diffusion, can solve these problems since it is easier to handle and has a bending radius of about 5 mm, which can be a big benefit in avionics networks. Its larger core diameter (50 mm to 1 mm) enables easy connections using inexpensive connectors. The increased core diameter allows higher tolerance to vibrations and to dust particles that can totally obstruct light propagation in glass fibers. The investigators will cover three different types of POF: large-core (up to 1 mm) step-index plastic optical fiber (SI-POF), multicore step-index plastic optical fiber (MC SI-POF), and graded-index plastic optical fiber (GI-POF). There are existing simulation models that capture all the guided modes in multimode fibers with detailed spatial fields; however, they are not adequate for large-core fibers, where there are millions of propagation modes. The project intends to develop computationally-efficient models that circumvent the need for prohibitively long simulation times and excessive computer memory. The model validation, a critical component of the project, will be done via a combination of the state-of-the-art device characterization laboratory at the University of Zaragoza and a testbed at the College of Staten Island. Montana State University will primarily work on advanced modulation formats and digital signal processing algorithms. Boeing Co. will provide prototype devices and realistic system designs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, chips need to communicate with each other through the chip packages and motherboard, which only provide a limited bandwidth. Chip-to-chip communication occurs through tiny traces that behave as transmission lines in chip packages and boards. Performance of an electronic system is dictated primarily by these electrical interconnections. The goal of this project is the high-frequency characterization of transmission lines and packages. This will allow development of simulation models and improved designs, which will eventually lead to faster computer systems. The project includes an industrial partner, which will provide a unique experience for the involved students in terms of internships and co-advising of theses. The education of graduate students involved in this project will also be enhanced by an international collaboration. Students from underrepresented groups will be offered assistantships through this project. The PI will continue outreach to high-school students to enable and encourage their participation in scientific conferences. The outcome of this research will be disseminated broadly to the engineering community in terms of a web-based application. Results of the project will also be part of a new graduate course on signal and power integrity.<br/><br/>Interconnects in chip packages cause signal attenuation and crosstalk, which limit the speed of high-frequency analog and high-speed digital systems. Performance of interconnects depends on the complex permittivity of the substrate as well as the under-fill material. In addition, surface roughness of conductors causes signal attenuation that may increase unpredictably at high frequencies. Hence, determination of these high-frequency properties is necessary for designing robust chip packages that can support faster signals. For the under-fill materials, the PI will design a semi-viscous-material holder in the form of a cavity resonator. The complex permittivity will then be extracted at the resonance frequencies. For the substrates and conductors, the PI will test a new methodology based on double-width stripline measurements. This methodology can for the first time provide unique characterization of substrate losses in the presence of surface-roughness losses. The measurements will be done using vector network analyzers, micro probes, and a probe station up to 67 GHz. Hence, this project will generate data on high-frequency properties of all critical chip package materials. Finally, simulation models from measured data will be generated for both conductors and dielectrics using a new generalized Debye modeling approach. Collaboration with an industrial partner will enable access to advanced package materials and processes for this research."

A hybrid simulator also enables them to interface with actual hardware devices such as PMUs used in grid monitoring. Furthermore, the hybrid simulator has the capability to interface with other real-time digital simulators as a network simulator to conduct smart grid communication co-simulations.

These challenges are particularly acute in the distribution system, where the networks are traditionally not monitored closely, and operators lack the essential information to obtain an accurate real-time operational state of the system. At the same time, the number of outages in distribution systems has started to increase as the system ages, and the loads become more dynamic.

These investigations bring in tools from power system analysis, optimization, and statistical learning to enable fundamental advances in the distribution system operations. In particular, these thrusts allow us to leverage recent advances in both technology and theory to develop timely and rigorous algorithms that solve some pressing engineering problems for the power grids.

In addition, it will enable the so-called cognitive radios that increase the utilization of scarce electromagnetic spectrum by dynamically identifying and opportunistically using vacant frequency bands. Both universal and cognitive radios are critically important to the further advancement of wireless connectivity in the country. The developed technology can find use in defense electronics and medical equipment where electromagnetic spectrum sensing and awareness is important for imaging and security applications. In addition to the technical impact, the proposed research activities will provide the diverse undergraduate and graduate students at the University of California, Los Angeles, with invaluable training in the strong interplay between signal processing and electronic circuit design techniques. Such cross-disciplinary training will help engineers better tackle many of the evolving challenges in electrical engineering.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop circuit and signal processing techniques to enable wide bandwidth, high resolution, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that can be placed at, or very close to, the antenna in a receiver. The proposed approach employs multi-rate filter-bank concepts and time-varying circuits. In a nutshell, a bank of analog filters, made of specially chosen, periodically time-varying circuit components, will be employed to channelize the RF signal into individual, but overlapping, frequency bands that are then digitized using a bank of slower ADCs. A bank of digital filters will intelligently combine the ADC outputs to faithfully reconstruct the original signal. Prototype integrated circuits will be designed, fabricated, and tested to verify the feasibility and utility of the proposed direct RF-to-digital converters and demonstrate record-setting ADC bandwidth and resolution combinations. The intellectual merits of this project are three-fold. Foremost, it will develop a new frequency-channelization ADC approach that is less sensitive to circuit mismatch and has relaxed dynamic range requirements as compared to the conventional time-interleaved ADC approach. Secondly, the time-varying circuit technique, which is a radical and beneficial departure from the conventional principle of making circuits linear and time-invariant, will lead to significant performance and power consumption benefits. The time-varying approach enables very high linearity and precision control of the frequency channelization filter to solve the central problem of all prior ADC approaches that use a bank of analog pre-filters. Finally, the proposed research represents a very tight coupling between integrated circuit design and signal processing theory that is becoming increasingly essential to solve the outstanding problems in integrated circuit design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The demand for overall computer and communication infrastructure is also increasing as a result. Electronics became a major driver of the global economy and increased quality of life with reduced device dimensions and integration of new materials and techniques. The recent advances in device technologies is enabling integration of large amount of high-speed data storage with logic circuits to construct computers on chip. If the memory access circuitry can be scaled down, the single-chip computer can significantly outperform the conventional computers in speed, power consumption, cost and size. One of the memory technologies that can enable integration of large data storage with logic circuits is phase change memory, which stores information in the highly resistive amorphous and conductive crystalline states of glassy materials as logic '1's and '0's. Phase change materials can also be used to make a family of multi-contact devices that complement conventional silicon electronics to reduce the area required for the logic circuits. The multi-contact phase change structures that are investigated in this study utilize thermal interactions in addition to electronic interactions to achieve the same or improved functionality at smaller area, reduced power and cost. The graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in device fabrication, characterization, simulations and modeling. The students involved with this project interact with industrial leaders to advance the field of phase change memory and will help transition this multi-contact phase change device technology to mass production. Minority students will be mentored through UConn Mentor Connection and Northeast Alliance program.<br/><br/>This project focuses on fundamental studies on electro-thermal interactions and behavior of phase change materials that enable multi-contact logic devices, and design, fabrication and evaluation of these multi-contact devices as multiplexers, routers, counters, state machines and other logic units.  These devices offer speeds comparable to DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and non-volatile configurations at sufficiently low power levels for critical feature sizes < 50 nm. Pattern transfer technologies to achieve sub-50 nm critical features are now commonly available in silicon CMOS and some of the large-scale manufacturers have announced high density phase change memory products. Hence, the challenges related to integration of phase change memory with CMOS are practically resolved, and new device and circuit concepts that utilize this infrastructure can lead to significant impacts in a relatively short time. These multi-contact phase change devices can be manufactured along with conventional phase change memory arrays atop silicon CMOS to realize logic functions at a significantly reduced transistor count in the CMOS layer."

Silicon based electronics is ubiquitous and provides excellent performance for many applications, but there still remain certain critical technology areas where other semiconductor materials, particularly wide band gap semiconductors, have properties that make them superior to silicon. Gallium Oxide is one such semiconductor whose intrinsic properties make it potentially superior for applications such as high frequency communications. However, to harness these properties for better performance, new device engineering (design and fabrication) techniques need to be developed. The proposed research project focuses on engineering of transistors based on this material that could enable high frequency electronics in a range that is higher than the typical wireless communication technology used currently. With the proliferation of networked intelligent devices and sensors throughout our environment, the need for high data rate communication is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Therefore, there is a significant need for high power density mm-wave amplifiers with high gain and efficiency. The development of Gallium Oxide-based high power mm-wave transistors proposed here could enable a new generation of such high data rate systems based on mm-wave and THz communications. A new course focused on wide band gap semiconductor devices will also be developed, whose course content will be offered free online. <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to determine the frequency and power limits for Gallium Oxide transistors in the mm-wave frequency range, and to design and demonstrate transistors with state-of-art device performance. While Gallium Oxide has higher breakdown field than other wide band gap semiconductors such as Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide, it has lower carrier mobility. In addition, the high field transport characteristics are relatively unknown. This project will lead to a vertically integrated investigation of the design, growth, fabrication, and characterization of highly scaled Gallium Oxide transistors. The project will lead to a better understanding of critical aspects of device engineering for Gallium Oxide devices, including epitaxial designs such as delta-doped transistors and heterostructures to enable scaled transistors with short gate lengths, understanding of low and high field electron transport in such scaled channels, control of dispersion caused by surface as well as buffer traps, and field management techniques (such as field plates and passivation) necessary to control field distributions in these transistors. The proposed project will therefore lay the foundation for a new generation of scaled transistors based on Gallium Oxide, and the scientific findings will impact not just high frequency transistors, but also other technologies such as power switching transistors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In comparison, the photonics industry lacks suitable infrastructure to provide the same leverage. As a result, the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics) is a new public-private partnership to address this challenge.  While the main focus of AIM Photonics is to leverage the silicon (Si) CMOS manufacturing infrastructure to make photonic devices, other material systems, such as Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) may be better suited for some applications.  Therefore, the focus of this effort is to work closely with the AIM Photonics Institute to develop new heterogeneous manufacturing processes that enable the direct integration of LiNbO3 with Si CMOS for advanced and economically feasible photonic devices and chip-scale systems.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/><br/>This project will develop a hybrid integration and packaging process for thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3) on silicon, to realize high performance RF-photonic devices, e.g., modulators, using low-loss chip-scale routing in silicon nitride (Si3N4) as an initial production level capability. This will be accomplished by leveraging the maturity of established silicon-electronic processing, integration, and packaging technologies and extend them to silicon-based photonic integrated circuits, through the AIM Photonics Institute. The key enabling capability will be to wafer-bond thin-film LiNbO3 directly to foundry scale silicon wafers to realize advanced heterogeneous RF-photonic circuits that are manufacturable within current industrial foundries while maintaining 3 sigma yields. The targeted design goals include: (1) ultra-high frequency modulators (> 100 GHz) for data networks, (2) highly efficient, non-blocking chip-scale routers for high-end data centers, and (3) high-power phased array antenna photonic feed networks compatible with legacy and future generation wireless communications. Thus, upon successful completion of the proposed project, significant contributions will be made to not only develop manufacturable heterogeneous integration processes but also to address pressing applications that span many sectors of the commercial market and touch nearly every aspect of society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The advent of a technique, known as wavelength-division multiplexing, helped in increasing the capacity of fiber-based communication systems during the decades of the 1990s and 2000s. However, current systems will not be able to meet the continuing increase in the data rates fueled by such activities as on-line learning and video streaming. A new technique, called space-division multiplexing (SDM), is being studied in the laboratories worldwide to meet this demand. It makes use of optical fibers that are designed to support multiple spatial modes either by using a single large-size core or several narrower cores, each supporting a single mode. However, before the SDM technique can be implemented in real systems, it is necessary to understand the impact of various nonlinear effects occurring inside a multimode fiber, or a multicore fiber whose cores are coupled in view of their close proximity. This is what the proposed research project will accomplish.<br/>The main goal of the proposed research is to develop and implement new theoretical and numerical tools for modeling the simultaneous propagation of multiple data streams through SDM inside a multicore or a multimode fiber. These tools will be used to develop a fundamental understanding of how each SDM channel is affected by other co-propagating channels in the presence of various nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman scattering, and four-wave mixing. Even though the modes of an ideal fiber should not be coupled to each other, modes of any realistic multimode fiber will experience some random coupling. A major objective of this GOALI project is to understand the origin of this coupling and study how it impacts various nonlinear effects and the performance of SDM systems. In this effort, our industrial partner would be of immense help because of the recent experiments performed at Bell Labs that have quantified the extent of random mode coupling in six-mode fibers. The project has both the fundamental and applied aspects. An improved understanding of the nonlinear phenomena in multimode fibers is of fundamental importance and should help the next generation of graduate students and scientists in coming up with new device ideas. The study of nonlinear effects should also help in designing the future SDM systems. Two graduate students will work with the P.I. on this GOALI project as a part of their Ph.D. thesis. Both of them will spend time each year at the industrial site so that they can acquire valuable industrial experience. This kind of training of the graduate students is ideal for developing the work force for the U.S. telecommunication industry."

The research and development of QIS-enabled science and technologies in the U.S., however, is impeded by the limited availability of quantum resources that require specialized expertise to generate and maintain. The INterdisciplinary QUantum Information REsearch (INQUIRE) central-campus instrument removes the barrier to access quantum resources for a broad scientific and student pool at the University of Arizona (UA). The INQUIRE instrument is the world's first shared major facility as a test-bed to foster interdisciplinary research and student training in QIS, an area identified as both a national and NSF-wide priority. This new instrument enables the convergence of QIS with diverse fields. INQUIRE is an accessible, multiuser, networked platform that communicates quantum resources over a unique fiber network between campus buildings, colleges, and scientific disciplines. Quantum entangled photons arrive from INQUIRE on demand to various laboratories conducting research in photonics, quantum-communications, bioimaging and sensing, and materials science. These laboratories use entangled photons in experiments and then route the processed light back to the INQUIRE instrument for ultrasensitive measurements. In doing so, groups with no QIS expertise enjoy state-of-the-art quantum resources to greatly foster the incorporation of QIS into diverse fields and create unprecedented research and education capabilities. Diverse early-career researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students in the UA Colleges of Engineering, Science, and Optical Sciences, and visiting researchers from other regional and national institutions benefit directly from advanced research and research training with the INQUIRE instrument, and pursue QIS-enabled science and technologies to benefit the society. Teaching laboratories at UA use INQUIRE to inspire STEM students to pursue QIS education and careers, and to develop the next-generation workforce who can apply the essential concepts of QIS to benefit U.S. society. In addition, middle-school and high-school students visit the QIS teaching laboratory to participate in QIS-based experiments, and open-house events provide local community tours of INQUIRE.<br/><br/>The INQUIRE instrument has: 1) three high-brightness entangled-photon sources operating at telecommunication wavelengths; 2) fiber optic links over a significant fraction of the UA campus that link five different buildings and disciplines; 3) optical switching to route entangled photons to multiple users and then back to INQUIRE's single-photon detectors for ultrasensitive measurements; and 4) a robust, safe, and accessible user and administrator software interface. This central instrument delivers unique light sources to multiple scientific disciplines such as biomedical engineering and materials science, and offers a first-of-its-kind platform to explore the beginnings of quantum information processing (QIP) and sharing. Research examples include QIP with two-dimensional materials, broadband quantum-communication networks, photobleaching-free biomedical imaging, and photonic quantum computing. The unprecedented capabilities include: 1) all resources are remotely accessed without requiring prior experimental QIS background to seamlessly integrate into a variety of end users' experimental pursuits; 2) the INQUIRE resources can be simultaneously accessed by multiple users, thereby maximizing the instrument's utilization; 3) a user-friendly software interface enables end users to remotely and safely configure the entangled-photon sources and take measurements; and 4) the administrator has a software interface to maintain and monitor the state of INQUIRE. Such an infrastructure provides highly automated management of this unique multiuser resource, and ensures the long-term stability and robustness of the instrument.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, all our wireless vision needs to be realized through the public radio spectrum, which cannot be further created but has to be efficiently shared among various wireless systems and devices. While significant progress has been made in efficient spectrum access and sharing technologies, their successful deployment towards fulfilling the national broadband plan relies crucially on the development of adequate security mechanisms. Such security mechanisms should be able to protect the welfare of all stakeholders in the spectrum sharing systems, in particular the federal government and military users; meanwhile, they should also be able to address the new challenges brought about by the advanced technologies and new access paradigms that have enabled innovative spectrum sharing. At the current stage, an effective security mechanism for spectrum sharing systems is lacking, which significantly impedes their practical deployment and consequently the realization of the anticipated wireless broadband revolution. This proposal constitutes a solid step towards filling this gap, seeking to obtain a deeper understanding of the emerging attacking strategy and behavior in this new arena, and develop a holistic view and solution to the security of spectrum access and sharing. The expected outcome will be valuable to all players in wireless industry, as well as to all sectors of the national economy that benefit from wireless innovation. The inter-disciplinary nature of the proposed research will naturally help promote cross-disciplinary education and well-rounded training of future IT workforce.<br/><br/>The proposed research will be focused on the security aspects of the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) paradigm and cognitive radio (CR) technology, which receive major research interest and also impose foremost research challenges. It is comprised of two thrusts. First, cross-layer attack and defense in CR networks will be addressed. Current research on CR security mainly focuses on attacks and defenses at individual protocol layers, but cross-layer attack naturally fits the CR setting and can lead to unprecedented detrimental effect. In this project, a general class of cross-layer attacks will be investigated. In response to cross-layer attacks, a cross-layer defense framework is subsequently proposed, for which two research tasks will be focused on: advance in individual detection modules for attacks unique to CR functionalities, and metrics-driven cross-layer fusion. In existing studies, the assumed capabilities at CR are rather modest. With the further development of CR technology, wireless devices will grow in reasoning and learning capabilities. Meanwhile, such technology progress can also be exploited by the adversaries to launch more sophisticated malicious attacks. In the second thrust, assuming more intelligence and growing reasoning and learning capabilities for both the CR user and the adversary, the arms race between them will be explored through the stochastic game modeling and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methodologies. The proposed research will be evaluated through theoretical analysis, numerical and network simulation, prototype implementation, and experimentation on real testbeds."

The motivation partially comes from a result that was recently obtained by the principal investigators, showing that unique factorization is possible under mild conditions if one adopts the volume minimization criterion. These conditions are far more realistic than those required by existing approaches, suggesting that more challenging scenarios and even new application domains are within reach if only related optimization, robustness, and scalability challenges can be effectively addressed. This research will provide the computational underpinnings of these exciting developments. High-performance volume minimization software will be publicly released to enable researchers and practitioners to tackle new problems, handle much larger datasets, and boost performance in existing applications like hyperspectral imaging. On the education front, the project will help train a graduate student in cutting-edge computational engineering research, and will also help engage talented undergraduates through senior honors projects, introducing them to research and publication opportunities.  <br/><br/>In terms of theory and methods, key aspects of volume minimization-based matrix factorization are still poorly understood. The research will provide a set of high-performance computational tools rooted in deep understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the original volume minimization criterion which promises exciting discoveries.

Devising scalable volume minimization algorithms makes a lot of sense for modern sensing and clustering problems which involve rapidly increasing amounts of data. From an applications point of view, volume minimization for spectrum sensing, channel identification, and document clustering are completely new and challenging."

These kinds of problems arise in a broad range of applications in engineering systems. Despite the substantial literature on convex and non-convex quadratic programming (general classes of optimization problems), most available optimization techniques are either not scalable or work efficiently only for convex quadratic programming and do not provide adequate results for non-convex quadratic programming. This project focuses on fundamental research on an integrated approach which the research team expects will lead to powerful solution methods for classes of non-convex programming problems. The new approach will be applicable for non-convex problems arising in many areas, such as power and energy systems, transportation, and communications. The project will involve students from underrepresented groups and will positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The general difficulty of power and energy optimization problems has a direct impact on power and energy systems management. This is one of the most fundamental concerns that must be dealt with in electrical power system management. The primary objective of this project is to address the difficulty associated with problem non-convexity by developing high-performance optimization techniques that apply to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems, particularly the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. There is a critical and urgent need for developing smart and robust OPF solvers. The conventional options currently available for DC-OPF are quite limited. The research will fundamentally address AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) with active and reactive quadratically constrained quadratic programming optimization problems of a form that arises in operation and planning applications of the power system. Besides being non-convex, these problems are identified to be NP-hard. The proposed solution method is based on several basic and powerful optimization techniques in convex optimization theory such as linearized approximation techniques, linear and global search procedures, bi-linear and convex relaxation, and alternate direction methods. Also, new schemes and theories must be introduced to establish the convergence of the algorithm and guarantee the global optimality of the solution results. The research team devised a new successive linear optimization based branch and bound (SLOBB) method based on deploying principles of the classical linear approximation, improved convex relaxation, and the branch-and-bound technique to find the global optimal solution of the AC-OPF problem. Since the linear programming and convex solvers are robust and fast, and also the power systems community is already familiar with linear and convex programs for OPF, the algorithm that will be developed will be beneficial and user-friendly for the AC-OPF problem. We will also pursue theoretical investigations to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and analyze its efficiency on existing test bed systems and synthetic data sets. The developed models and methodologies will be executed in real-world practical power grids."

A key impediment to progress on true electronic-photonic integration has been the lack of a circuit element that operates in both the domain of light (photons) and electrons.  An important breakthrough, made at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign by Professors Nick Holonyak, Jr. and Milton Feng, is that certain types of transistors (the basic building blocks of electronic circuits) can be modified to generate and be acted on by light.  These light-emitting transistors (LETs) and transistor lasers (TLs) will be used in this program to form true electronic-photonic digital logic circuits, and high-speed optical links both on and between chips.  This technology is expected to dramatically improve the speed and energy efficiency of devices that process information, and to enable the commercial success of a new class of integrated circuits at the forefront of performance.  Education and outreach activities will introduce undergraduates and high school teachers to a new technology based on light, renewing excitement in STEM-related fields and the creating the promise for a future career in electronic-photonic circuit engineering.<br/><br/>The technical work in this program is focused on bringing into existence a basic electronic-photonic circuit that can be used as the core building block for ultra-energy-efficient electronic-photonic computing systems.

Although in the past decade THz integrated circuits in silicon have improved remarkably in output power and efficiency, their reliance on high-quality-factor resonance makes the current THz sensors narrowband and fails to fully capitalize on the available broad spectrum for wide-range gas sensing and high-precision radar ranging. To break such a limit, this project investigates a new technique based on electronic THz frequency comb. Through parallel signal processing on the integrated circuit chip, gas sensor and imaging radar using the proposed technique will achieve significantly better spectral coverage and energy efficiency. This research effort will also be integrated with the principal investigator's educational career goal of promoting highly-interdisciplinary studies through the creation of new courses and engaging underrepresented and K-12 students through MIT's outreach programs.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to leverage the integration capability of the silicon semiconductor fabrication process and use THz frequency comb technique to distribute the signal-sensing load to an array of narrowband, precisely-controlled THz circuit units. It maintains high energy efficiency while covering a wide bandwidth in a scalable fashion. Sensors based on two types of THz frequency comb will be investigated under this program. First, a rotational-mode molecular sensor will be demonstrated using an evenly distributed frequency comb. The frequency comb will seamlessly cover more than 100 GHz of bandwidth and increase the spectral scanning speed of chip-scale THz spectrometer by a factor of 200. Through an on-chip frequency calibration technique, the spectrometer will scan the frequency spectrum with one-part-per-billion level frequency precision. Second, an imaging radar will be demonstrated using a non-uniform comb and compressive sensing. By quantizing the target distance with a set of nonlinearly distributed wavelengths and by using an error-correction algorithm, the radar can operate with low signal-to-noise ratio and low power consumption. The THz comb radar will also be integrated with a low-cost sensor array in a quasi-optical configuration, so that real-time 3D imaging with electronic scanning and fine resolution can be realized. Through these comprehensive studies, the program will establish the advantages of parallelism in chip-scale wide-band signal sensing and processing."

The developed radio frequency waveform exhibits no feature that can be exploited by the adversary to detect its existence through time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, or cyclostationary analysis.<br/><br/>This project takes advantage of recent progress in the radar and communication communities and brings them together synergistically to develop an unprecedented low probability of detection, secure radio frequency waveform design.

This project employs a novel bio-inspired RF steganography scheme to obscure the communication signal within a radar signal. This newly designed signal remains an effective radar signal providing normal radar capabilities such as range measurement to its operators; but it also carries secure digital communication intended for designated receivers. Instead of limiting the transmission power of the signal in hopes of avoiding detection by the adversary, the newly designed waveform is broadcast at maximum power. However the adversary does not detect the existence of digital modulation embedded in the hybrid signal because it does not exhibit any feature when subjected to time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis, or cyclostationary analysis. This project is transformative because it provides a brand new way to design low probability of detection and secure communication and radio frequency systems, and it also paves the way to future development of a universal cognitive radio frequency platform where all radio frequency systems such as communication, radar, and navigation are designed jointly to optimize their performance and spectrum efficiency."

During the formation of blood clots, biochemically activated platelets interact with growing networks of fibrin polymers and contract against this fibrin scaffold. Today, few tools exist to predict when a person may experience abnormal clotting or bleeding, and nearly all of these tools rely on sensing biochemicals associated with clot formation or breakup. However, new research has shown that changes to the physical forces nominally applied by platelets are associated with bleeding. Rather than attempting to sense trace amounts of biochemicals associated with clotting, the ultimate goal of this project is, thus, to examine platelet forces to predict abnormal bleeding and clotting. The physical strength of a cell may be directly linked to bleeding and clotting, thus representing a potentially ""disruptive"" paradigm of biophysical testing that could be applied to many other diseases. While promising, this novel approach requires assaying a large population of platelets to gain clinically relevant data and predict bleeding and clotting disorders. Using today's technologies, which are mostly utilizing microscopy-based optical techniques, this still requires too much time to be useful in the clinic. <br/><br/>To overcome the limitations of optical techniques to measure platelet forces, this proposal seeks to explore non-optical transduction mechanisms to create a rapid, high-throughput platform capable of assaying large numbers of individual platelets. More specifically, the goal of this project is to develop piezoresistive sensing platforms for high-throughput mechanical testing of single blood platelets. Using piezoresistive transducers for force sensing, the proposed platforms will overcome the key bottleneck to high-throughput single-cell force analysis with all existing techniques, namely their reliance on optical imaging. The two proposed sensing platforms are based on arrays of microdots and nanopillars and mimic the two most common optical platforms for cell force measurements, traction force microscopy and microfabricated post array detectors, respectively. Thereby, the contraction force exerted by a blood platelet on a pair of microdots is measured with underlying sub-micrometer strain gauges, while the platelet-contraction-induced deflection of nanopillars is sensed by stress-sensitive metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) embedded into the underlying substrate. On the sensing system side, the intellectual merit lies in the design and fabrication of large arrays of piezoresistive force sensors with nano-Newton force resolution in an ultra-small form factor, targeting a pitch for the microdot/pillar pairs of less than 15m."

Availability of such services is essential to education, jobs, health care, and the economic development of these areas. The objective of the proposed work is to develop a practical and affordable wireless communication system that covers and best fits the needs of rural areas.

The proposed procedure is based on the use of the so called ""advanced"" nodes which include the use of ""directional antennas,"" beam steering capabilities, integration of propagation modeling, implementation of cognitive spectrum sensing capabilities, and also providing networking topology controls in each of these nodes.  Specific innovations include development of new broadband, dual polarization and low cost directional antenna array designs with beam steering capabilities and the implementation of multi-level details propagation modeling to enhance receivers performance while minimizing required computation time and resources. The proposed cognitive network system and the associated introduction of the ""advanced"" nodes, not only provide communication advantages such as extended range and area coverage using high gain antennas and the relatively lower power requirements when directional (rather than omnidirectional) antennas are used, but the integration of the communication channel links controls in these units facilitates interfaces between the proposed directional physical layer with the MAC and other upper layers in the ISO model without modification or alteration of set standards and protocols.<br/><br/> A team of investigators with expertise in antennas, propagation, and networking, is participating in this proposal.

Developing practical methods to mitigate interference is critical for the future of wireless technology. The proposed research addresses the problem of interference, and therefore has a large potential impact on economic growth as well as quality of life. This project has two interconnected components. First, based on recent information theory results, communication streams will be decomposed into many small streams; these can be managed, combined, and split to combat interference. Second, adaptive liquid-metal antennas will be investigated for interference mitigation. As liquid metals can be made to change their physical shape, they can enable antennas that can be adjusted to reduce interference. Research and education for this project will be tightly integrated through Vertically Integrated Projects that involve students ranging from PhD students to sophomore-level undergraduates, including under-represented minority and female students. The results of this research will be disseminated widely through the web, technical conferences, and seminars. <br/><br/>Exciting discoveries in recent years have pushed the boundaries of understanding interference. The theoretical capacity of interference channels in several operating modes has been established, and new theoretical techniques such as interference alignment have been discovered. However, many practical challenges stand in the way of realizing these promising techniques. This project has two interconnected components for developing interference-mitigation techniques for wireless networks that create a new direction in interference mitigation aimed at practicality and wide applicability. The first component of the project decomposes the communication stream into ""microstreams"" to fit the transmissions into the contours of available opportunities, in a manner that improves rates while limiting the damage of interference. The broad principle of breaking communication into many small pieces has a long and distinguished pedigree, including ARQ in the data link layer and TCP/IP in higher layers. The proposed research introduces a novel manifestation of this time-tested principle to produce new approaches that combat interference in the physical layer. The second component of the project investigates adaptive liquid-metal antennas that generate radiation patterns to avoid interference in a manner not possible with signal processing alone; in particular their unique flexibility helps to avoid ""singular"" values of channel gains that prevent interference mitigation. The unique strengths of liquid-metal antennas are perfectly showcased in this application, because the exact manner of microstream combining can have a strong effect on performance, and this is where liquid-metal antennas promise to have a strong impact. The proposed activity will play an important role in the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the field of wireless interference. The project will develop practical methods for coding and decoding under interference. Furthermore, it will lead to a basic understanding of how liquid-metal antennas can affect capacity in interference networks."

The goal of this project is to design a comprehensive sparse learning based methodology, which converts challenging combinatorial sensor selection problems to sparsity-encouraged convex optimization problems that can be solved efficiently. The research agenda will include development of sparse learning approaches in view of sensor collaboration structures, design of incentive-based mechanisms to fulfill sensing demands as well as individual sensors profits, and design of dynamic management policies that adapt to time-varying environments and incentives of sensors. Success of this project will greatly advance sensor management designs and potentially significantly improve efficiency of practical mobile phone sensing systems.

With such exponential increases, it is inevitable that limits of current approaches and practices for computation and memory related technologies are reached. This proposal addresses the basic operations of computation and memory with respect to the fundamental limits on the energy dissipation needed to perform the operations. It also studies the energy cost associated with measurement and feedback actions for performing computing and memory management operations. It provides proof of concept experiments and methods to demonstrate realizability of the computational and memory related operations with energetics tens of order smaller than the current practices. The associated analysis of fundamental primitives of computational operations and the proof of concept experiments will guide realizations of future energy efficient computational platforms and will continue the remarkable increase in speed and efficiencies with which computations are performed.<br/><br/><br/>The focus of the project is on the fundamental limits on the energetics of computations and memory.  The project investigates primitives of computational operations both analytically and experimentally. It uses the abstraction of the state of a memory bit via the position of a particle in a double well potential in a thermal bath. Transfer of particle across the wells in a potential landscape is used to realize AND, NOT and erasure operations. Under the project goals, bounds on the minimum energetics of transferring the state of the particle in the double well potential will be analytically derived.  Here, key aspect of the approach is to estimate the change in entropy from the initial to the final state, and, relating the change in entropy to the energy associated with the transfer of state. The transfer of state can be accomplished with or without measuring the state of the particle in the double well potential; here, the effect of feedback where the measurement guides the protocol for transferring the state will be understood and analyzed. The theoretical foundations that link computations, statistical mechanics, and feedback will be accompanied by a versatile experimental platform. Double-well potentials will be realized by controlling optical fields which have the scale of energetics suited for the study. The experimental protocols will accommodate the need for different speeds of transferring the state; important to emulate quasi-static processes. Accurate and precise measurements of the position of the particle will be used for the estimation of the energy required in moving the particle across wells. The measurement protocols will be precisely characterized that will enable the study of closed-loop strategies that alter the transfer protocol based on measurements. The project will provide both analytics and proof-of-concept experimental realizations of basic primitives of computations with orders in magnitude smaller energy footprint.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to make autonomous decisions, nodes need to have a reasonable degree of situational awareness achieved through recognition and tracking of entities in dynamic environments.  This may not be possible in partially occluded environments, where individual nodes may have limited visibility, unless nodes participate in collaborative sensing, i.e., share sensed information. Sharing raw/processed real-time sensing data with centralized resources in the cloud or at the network edge poses potentially high communication/computational burdens, particular in safety critical settings requiring low latency. This motivates the need to study distributed collaborative sensing frameworks leveraging powerful algorithms for tracking and deep learning models for reliable recognition/classification tasks. Of particular interest is a characterization of what collaborating sensors can ``see'' in occluded environments and how one should realize information sharing in resource constrained settings to fairly optimize what nodes ``know'', i.e., their situational awareness. The proposed research effort will advance the state-of-the-art in collaborative sensing systems which are expected to benefit the field and society more broadly, through planned efforts in education innovation, achieving diversity, engaging the community and industry, and disseminating results to a wider public.<br/><br/>This proposal centers on the study of collaborative sensing in obstructed/dynamic environments, such as might be used to enable self-driving vehicles and autonomous robots. The central challenge is to achieve an unprecedented level of real-time situational awareness based on distributed sensing resources in a possibly communication and/or computationally constrained setting. The proposed research integrates three research thrusts. The first is the advancement of the fundamental understanding what is visible to sets of distributed sensing units in stochastic environments. This work will leverage stochastic geometric models and analysis to provide robust quantitative performance assessment of `visibility' for typical random environments. The performance limits determined in this research thrust will inform what a distributed system can ``know"" in resource constrained settings. The second thrust is the development of fundamental underpinnings of distributed collaborative sensing with a focus on the optimization of interactive information sharing and/or adaptation to changing environmental contexts so as to jointly maximize situational awareness amongst autonomous yet collaborating nodes. We will provide new approaches driven by structural properties of the optimization problems (e.g., submodularity) and interactive information sharing protocols to facilitate distributed object recognition and tracking. The third thrust is the development of a scaled-down platform for controlled and reproducible experimentation of alternative collaborative sensing system designs. The last thrust is not only geared at providing platform to advance the research but is also an activity to engage a substantial number of undergraduates and a springboard to our educational efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This makes the electric power grid increasingly vulnerable to service interruptions and blackouts. Given practical limitations posed on infrastructure upgrading (mainly economical and regulatory), the optimized use of the existing assets is of paramount importance. It is then essential to accurately determine network operating conditions, allowing for optimized planning and operation of the system. By increasing the level of detail in the electric power line models, and removing select historical modeling assumptions, this project aims at developing models that take into account available information including ambient conditions, to result in more accurate determination of the network operating conditions. The proposed work will enrich the power and energy systems field by introducing innovative ways to represent electric power lines, which will impact not only utilities and dispatchers, but also consumers. One of the critical expected outcomes of this project is the more accurate determination of line power handling capabilities, which results in optimized use of existing transmission and distribution assets, allowing for more reliable, efficient and cost-effective delivery of electricity. <br/> <br/>This project plans to investigate and formulate the coupling of temperature-dependent transmission line models that are able to account for longitudinal non-uniformities in line parameters, with dynamic line rating techniques, leading to a novel methodology to estimate transmission network parameter and model structure of an electric power system.  This would result in increased accuracy in estimates of network loading capabilities and system voltage stability indices. The integrated approach comprises: (i) a new network modeling technique involving temperature-dependent line model structures, (ii) a practical system application tool that utilizes the adaptive line models and dynamic line ratings to better estimate transfer capability limits (both off-line and on-line), and (iii) a performance evaluation and assessment plan. These research activities will provide a framework to study electric power systems by incorporating environmental conditions as new degrees of freedom in the line models. The focus will be on adaptive determination of transmission network models and of system transfer capability limits.  Specifically, the main research goals are to: (i) analytically investigate ambient condition-dependent power line models, including longitudinal non-uniformity in line parameters due to gradients in external conditions, (ii) develop effective system applications tools, with special attention to the estimation of line power handling capabilities, and (iii) under the guidance of  industry collaborators, validate and evaluate the performance of resulting system models and application tools in a laboratory setting as well as against field measurement data."

As a proof-of-concept we are applying these techniques for designing passive, battery-less structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors that can continuously sense and time-stamp important and rare events that could have occurred during the operating life span of the structure. For instance in orthopedic implants like knee or hip implants, the use of these techniques would be able convey temporal information about any mechanical misalignment or any abnormal usage of the implant. This information could be useful to surgeons in diagnosing and planning of any revision surgery. For civil and aerospace structures, these techniques could be used to determine when the structure was subjected to large mechanical deformations or strains; or when a rare, unwanted mechanical impact with the structure could have occurred.  In combination with computer models, the time-stamped event information could be used in prognosticating impending failures and can be used in determining condition-based maintenance schedules.  Thus, the proposed self-powered sensing technology could be a key facilitator in achieving the grand vision for the internet-of-things, where millions of passive, inexpensive sensors could become an integral part of ""smart"" structures (civil, aerospace, mechanical and biomechanical) that can self-diagnose its own catastrophic failure. As a part of the outreach activities, the project is developing a cross-disciplinary forum between the electrical, structural and biomedical engineers; and includes design of educational modules and organization of tutorial and special sessions in the area of self-powered sensors. Also, in addition to the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, the project is also fostering student entrepreneurship activities in the area of sensors and structural health monitoring.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the investigation of thermodynamically and quantum-mechanically driven electron transport phenomena that can be used to implement perpetual timers and clocks. Different device and layout topologies are being investigated that will lead to timers with different dynamical responses and to timers that can continuously operate over the entire monitoring period. The physics of the timer is being combined with the physics of the piezoelectricity driven impact-ionized hot-electron injection process to achieve self-powered monitoring of mechanical strain when the sensor is embedded or implanted inside a mechanically active structure. Using an array of these timer-modulated hot-electron injectors, the project is investigating sparse reconstruction algorithms that will be able to time stamp salient strain-related events. As a proof-of-concept, the circuits implementing the self-powered timers and the self-powered strain sensors are being prototyped in a standard CMOS process are also being integrated with previously developed radio-frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensing system-on-chip architectures. This hybrid energy scavenging configuration will not only enable continuous, self-powered monitoring of salient and rare events but will also enable wireless retrieval of the sensor data along with remote initialization and configuration of the sensor under user command and control."

Compared to their current counterparts, WBG devices are capable of higher blocking voltage, switching frequencies, power handling capacity and thermal conductivity, which can motivate migration toward electrification of transportation and a highly automated modern grid, among other applications. In harsh operating environments, these components are subjected to various mechanical and electrical stresses, wear out, and vibration that contribute to increased equipment failure potential, where a failed component can cause unexpected interruptions, serious safety issues, or easily lead to millions of dollars in repair costs. The proposed research plan will help achieve self-monitoring reliable WBG power electronics systems by providing condition monitoring tools that broaden understanding of the WBG device degradation process, incipient fault diagnosis and remaining useful lifetime prediction. Establishing an advanced reliability framework will lead to new scientific tools, accelerating deployment of WBG systems in grid integration, electric transportation and defense systems. The long-term vision and career plan of the PI is to integrate several thrusts relevant to this program, namely: WBG power semiconductors, power electronics systems, and fault diagnosis/prognosis theory as core disciplines. On the educational side, the goal is to develop educational materials that provide an integrated view of relevant fields for training the next generation of power electronics engineers. The PI will continue to reach out to high school students with tangible, project centric experience in his laboratory. The technologies and tangible applications developed as a result of the proposed plan will serve as instruments to inspire and encourage students to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the proposal aims to investigate incipient faults of wide band-gap semiconductor devices and create online fault diagnosis / failure prognosis tools to establish early warning systems for future power electronics systems. The rapid and widespread deployment of wide band-gap semiconductors raises significant reliability concerns, particularly for mission and safety critical systems due to limited field data and potential uncertainties. Continuously monitoring these systems is essential to prevent unexpected shutdowns and catastrophic failures that could result in fatal accidents or significant loss in operations. However, current diagnostic engineering tools are not mature enough to detect or identify failure precursors in real time, leading to a major reliability gap in WBG-based power conversion systems. In order to reliably move WBG technologies forward, this proposal investigates: (i) WBG device degradation processes under various accelerated aging conditions and failure precursors for use in early warning systems; (ii) novel online degradation monitoring tools to improve overall reliability using readily available system components; (iii) new analytical insights for fault growth model derivation to dynamically evaluate the fault severity level, obtain an adaptive fault threshold, and predict the remaining useful lifetime; (iv) an integrated framework enabling autonomous incipient fault diagnosis and health assessment for self-monitoring smart-energy conversion systems; and (v) secondary control/modulation schemes which minimize electrical and thermal stresses on faulty WBG components for lifetime extension. These tools will provide a foundation for self-monitoring, smart-energy conversion systems that can recognize failure precursors at an early stage and thus help prevent catastrophic failures."

The power grid's increasing dependence on information systems and technologies however challenges its capability to become aware of and accordingly recover from unexpected incidents.  This is because the traditional situational awareness paradigm in grid operations has so far limited to events and contingencies at the physical grid layer. A vivid example of this limitation is the recent cyber-attacks to the Ukrainian power grid, where cyber intrusions invisible to grid operators caused unauthorized tripping of circuit breakers and thereby wide-area blackouts. To address this status quo, the objective of this CAREER project is to equip grid operators with better tools to monitor the underlying cyber-states, particularly focusing on the operational quality and security of the cyber layer. Its successful completion will transform the grid operational paradigm by providing integrated situational awareness capabilities of both cyber and physical assets, towards more efficient, secure, and resilient power gird infrastructures.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to develop a suite of improved situational awareness tools that can seamlessly bridge the cyber-physical layers of today's electricity delivery infrastructures. At the bulk transmission level, we propose to revitalize the design of traditional energy control center systems, in particular the topology processing and security analysis modules, to jointly infer the cyber-physical operating states and to efficiently evaluate the security impacts of potential cyber-physical contingencies. As for small-footprint microgrids, we propose to investigate the flexibility and vulnerability trade-offs between centralized and distributed architectures in the presence of cyber-intrusions to communication links. Our research plan consists of three cohesive thrusts: T1) Optimal topology inference and cyber state estimation using a multitude of cyber-physical data; T2) Real-time cyber-physical dynamic security assessment by developing the 'cyber-contingency distribution factors' and model-free stability analysis methods; and T3) Distributed microgrid operations under cyber-physical disturbances and countermeasure designs. This CAREER development plan will also integrate an education plan with  the research goals by i) developing a learning platform with cyber-physical grid visualization that is appropriate for pre-college students, ii) introducing course projects and special topics on the cyber aspects to college-level power engineering curricula, and iii) promoting undergraduate research experience especially for female and under-represented engineering students."

This technology is vital for intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection for in vitro fertilization, drug response assays in cancer research, and fabrication of bioengineered tissues in regenerative medicine. However, even with the existing tools and protocols, one of the main factors that affects the success of these procedures is still the skill of the operator. There is an unmet need for a sensing technique that provides quantitative and reliable information, rather than experiences or intuition alone, to help operators make a correct decision. This project aims to meet this need by providing a method of real-time micro/mesoscale manipulation based on 3D imaging and micro-scale force sensing. This will be accomplished by building a manipulator system comprised of microfabricated cantilever force sensors and arrayed microscopes to provide suitable real-time visual feedback to the operator. As all the data gathered by this system is digital, the system can be remotely viewed and controlled via the internet, which makes the system an excellent platform for STEM education. The team will work with a local high school to develop and test educational biological experiments for K-12 students. This will enhance their learning by providing application-based research methods otherwise not available to students.<br/><br/>Elastography is an emerging imaging modality to quantify the elasticity of tissues. When a mechanical force is applied to a tissue, the induced internal strain distribution indicates the map of elasticity. Soft regions show larger deformation compared to the hard regions, and vice versa. This elasticity map provides crucial information needed for medical diagnosis or guidance of surgical tools. The use of elastography is currently based on ultrasound imaging to observe macroscale organs in the size range of a few centimeters. The central hypothesis to be investigated is that the benefit of elastography can be scaled down to tissues that are about 100 times smaller than those studied in conventional ultrasound elastography. The goal of the project is to establish the method of real-time micro/mesoscale elastography that targets biosamples between 0.1 millimeters and 1 millimeter in size. A real-time micro/mesoscale tissue manipulation system will be developed to provide quantitative 3D force-deformation analysis to enable operators to reliably manipulate tissues and make informed diagnostic choices. The two key enabling technologies are microscale cantilever-based manipulation and 3D real-time tomography. As the force-sensing cantilever applies a force to the sample, multi-angle images are simultaneously acquired from the 16-arrayed microscopes to reconstruct high-resolution 3D images. Maps of 3D deformation will be generated to find the strains induced within the sample and the cantilever. Knowing the mechanical stiffness of the cantilever, the stress induced in the sample will be found. Since the proposed method is based on optical deformation analysis, it will provide force sensing capabilities without using electrical force sensors. Not only the microfabricated cantilevers but also conventional tools including glass tubes and needles will be used with the added function of force sensing, once their stiffness is calibrated. The efficacy of the system will be validated through manipulation of 3D microtissues and sperm injection experiments using zebrafish eggs. The ability to visualize and manipulate micro/mesoscale objects plays an important role in many emerging biomedical applications. However, mechanical tools that focus on samples in such size scales are still in their infancy. The proposed research is among the first steps in this direction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data can be transmitted or received through seawater, earth, or other challenging environments at the rate between 1000 and 10,000 events per second by stationary or rotatory methods. The antennae for such transmission ought to be portable so that they can be carried by first responders. Stationary antennae as simple as a loop of wire are not portable as they require kilometers of real estate. Rotatory antennae employing motor(s) driving permanent magnets suffer from reliability, noise, and service duration associated with moving parts. The proposed concept overcomes these shortcomings by avoiding bulk motion in the synthesis of a centimeter-sized antenna swirling a magnetic cloud. It relies on 'variable material' rather than the 'variable structure' on which mechanical rotation relies. Local first responders will be consulted, and their feedback will be used to identify design constraints. Electrical, civil, and ocean engineering students will learn electromagnetism, power electronics, and hardware validation. <br/><br/>The main objective of the work plan is to reduce the dimensions of an ultra-low-frequency antenna from kilometers to centimeters. The full proposal proves mathematically that such drastic size reduction requires the generation of a rotating magnetic field. The EAGER novelty is to create such rotating magnetic field without using moving parts. Two pieces of hardware will be designed, constructed, and tested: an ultra-low-frequency antenna and a sensitive magnetometer capable of detecting femto-Teslas. The antenna is constructed from two basic cells. Each basic cell comprises a Neodymium magnet serving as a source of magnetic flux, a ferrite yoke serving as a high-permeability conduit of magnetic flux, and a current-controlled saturable inductor serving as a 'shutter' for magnetic flux. The shutter's core is realized by non-oriented 80% nickel-iron alloy or square-loop ferrite that can be saturated with low control current. At zero control current, the shutter's permeability is high. Since the ferrite yoke's permeability is already high, the flux from the magnet is trapped (no emission) by the shutter and the yoke.  As the control current increases, the shutter's permeability decreases to let more flux emit from the magnet. A circular array of basic cells and the associated modulated control currents will generate a spinning magnetic cloud. Simulation of a preliminary design suggests that 100 femto-Teslas at 1000 Hertz would be detected under seawater at 100m away from a two-cell prototype with dimensions of 15 x 9.5 x 3 cubic centimeters. This preliminary design will be refined in the first quarter, and a flux shutter will be constructed. The shutter, ferrite yoke, and permanent magnet will be integrated to realize the antenna in the second quarter. A single-axis induction magnetometer will be designed and tested in the third quarter to measure the expected femto-Teslas at 100 m away. Three-axis magnetometer will be constructed in the fourth quarter to detect the field vector. The power electronics to drive the antenna will be designed and fabricated by the third quarter. The antenna and its driver will be integrated and field-tested in the fourth quarter. The project is deemed successful upon detection of 100 femto-Teslas at 1000 Hertz at 100m distance with an antenna volume less than 450 cubic centimeters, and without moving parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The evolving complexity of wireless communications demands fundamental changes to existing electromagnetic wave analysis and modeling methodologies. Often at times, there is no precise knowledge of the wave system, the radiating noise source, and the propagation environment. Furthermore, in the short-wavelength regime, the electromagnetic wave scattering process can be very sensitive to details. It results in a very high variability of wave distributions, and makes the deterministic solution relevant only to the specific configuration. This project proposes new physics-oriented statistical electromagnetic wave models to resolve environmental uncertainties. The proposed research opens up new pathways to exploit the complexity of propagation environments when designing wireless devices and antennas. The outcomes will establish a configurable virtual testbed for communications in complex environments not confined by the laboratory measurements. The research advancements will be integrated with the education to develop unconventional educational tools. The project will create a virtual reality electromagnetic laboratory at University of New Mexico (UNM), which offers a multifaceted teaching and learning environment through innovative data visualization and interactive simulation. Other educational components include developing online courses and advanced cross-disciplinary courses, mentoring high school students through UNMTemps Youth Summer program, and broadening participation of underrepresented groups by working with UNM's state-funded Multicultural Engineering Program and the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to investigate fundamental mathematical models and computational algorithms for the statistical wave analysis in complex electromagnetic environments. The project will study an innovative theoretical solution to Maxwell's Equations in the wave-chaotic media (domains exhibiting ray-chaotic dynamics). The fundamental solution (stochastic Green's function) rigorously integrates the coherent and incoherent propagations within a compact form. A new stochastic integral equation method is proposed for the statistical wave propagation through the chaotic environment. It quantitatively interprets the universal statistical properties of wave chaos through the random matrix theory. Since real-world electromagnetic systems often exhibit mixed chaotic and regular wave dynamics, the second part of the work investigates the first-principles theoretical framework of combing the integrable (regular) and non-integrable (chaotic) wave dynamics. By incorporating the component-, site-, and system-specific information with the universal chaotic dynamics, the work accomplishes a comprehensive framework for the statistical analysis and uncertainty quantification of complex wave systems. The advancements will establish an imperative simulation-driven, design-under-chaos capability, which is expected to have a big impact in the engineering discipline. Knowledge from this project will bring forth a new generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools that will revolutionize electromagnetic simulation, prediction, design and optimization in complex environments.

Such applications include coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles that operate in variable atmospheric conditions, concepts for relocatable marine hydrokinetic energy systems that operate in a varying ocean environment, and airborne wind energy systems that operate in an atmospheric environment where the wind varies with respect to both time and vertical position. This research will focus on deriving general theory that will be relevant to a variety of applications, along with the validation of these results on an airborne wind energy system. In airborne wind energy systems, the conventional tower is replaced by tethers and a lifting body (a wing or aerostat) that elevates a horizontal-axis turbine to high altitudes. Because the tether lengths can be adjusted, the operating altitude can be varied to optimally harness the wind resource. The work will include a substantial complementary educational component, wherein graduate, undergraduate, and STEM high school students will utilize NREL's Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to optimize renewable/storage/dispatchable network configurations for microgrids in North Carolina and California.<br/><br/>This research will derive new control theoretic knowledge and tools for the systems that operate in a spatiotemporally varying and partially observable environment. While optimal control in a temporally varying environment is a well-studied problem that can be addressed through Markov models, the addition of a spatial component results in an explosion in the number of states, rendering Markov-based methods computationally infeasible in most cases. Furthermore, the presence of partial observability results in a fundamental tradeoff between exploration (obtaining knowledge of the spatial environment) and exploitation (operating at the most favorable locations). To address the complexities of this spatiotemporal optimization problem, this research will explore the use of a multi-rate, multi-scale hierarchical framework. Specifically, an upper-level controller will perform a global optimization over a very coarse grid (thereby rendering the optimization computationally tractable), and a lower-level optimization will perform adjustments on a much finer grid. The research will focus on model predictive control for the upper-level optimization and will explore the use of extremum seeking and model predictive control strategies at the lower level. Control algorithms will be validated on a model of a lighter-than-air airborne wind energy system, using real wind shear profile models and load demand data. In this airborne wind energy system, the wind speed is only measurable at the system?s operating altitude (thereby making the problem partially observable), and significant energy production improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude.<br/>uction improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude."

This proposal aims at the development of novel theory and hardware that will significantly improve the ability to reuse the crowded spectrum by leveraging the capabilities of full-duplex mobile users in sensing the spectrum while they are transmitting. The concept of a fully passive full-duplex radio front-end in this proposed research is a fundamental shift from the conventional full-duplex radio designs that shall provide significant power and complexity advantages. The use of the proposed design in cognitive networks to intelligently detect unused radio spectrum is expected to lead to more efficient use of the spectrum and significant capacity enhancement that is not easily achievable using existing technologies. In the long term, the proposed concept has the transformative potential to improve wireless systems in a variety of aspects, ranging from high-capacity distributed multiple-input multiple-output solutions, efficient network protocols to support intelligent interference coordination, and management to reduce latency in multi-hop wireless networks. Besides these societal and technical contributions, this project will also advance discovery and understanding via integrating with both graduate and undergraduate education, and enhance infrastructure for research and education via an interdisciplinary, inter-institutional collaboration. The education and collaboration plans will additionally broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, including those from a predominantly undergraduate institution and female students. <br/><br/>Through a collaboration between two experts in different areas (i.e., antenna design and communication theory), the overall objective of the proposed interdisciplinary research project is to develop new architectures and algorithms for full-duplex cognitive radio wireless communications to significantly improve reuse of the crowded spectrum. The specific aims of the project include the following: 1) to design and develop fully passive full-duplex hardware architectures suited for cognitive mobile devices, which significantly cancel the self-interference without the need for adaptive analog cancellation at the 5 Ghz band or below; 2) to investigate the applications of the proposed full-duplex hardware architectures in enhancing white spectrum usage and increasing capacity of cognitive radio links under the context of opportunistic spectrum access; and 3) to investigate the applications of the proposed full-duplex hardware architectures in multiuser cognitive networks for further sensing performance improvement and capacity enhancement. For Aim 1, the merit of the approach is in the use of novel antenna configurations that provide a considerable amount of isolation from self-interference. The design is based on obtaining two identical out-of-phase components of self-interference signals. The design is fully passive and can be used in wideband applications. For Aims 2 and 3, the approach to the information-theoretical characterization<br/>of the full-duplex cognitive radio link and network is founded on capacity calculation techniques using novel results in real and complex analysis, probability theory, and optimization theory.

In this research, parametric effect, like a child pumping a swing by periodically standing and squatting to increase the size of the swing's oscillations, is investigated to remove this limitation. It turns out that one move a plate of a capacitor using sound waves or mechanical input over a certain threshold level to start this type of oscillation in an electrical circuit without a need for a battery. Initial analysis shows that this energy conversion can be very efficient, leading to remotely powering medical devices with ultrasound, and this oscillation can be started potentially with very small input levels, leading to very sensitive mechanical sensors to be used for energy harvesting, seismic or underwater sensing. In this project, these possibilities and fundamental limits of this unique approach will be explored experimentally and through detailed models.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to test a radically different approach to acoustic power transfer and sensing through the use of electrical parametric oscillators (resonators) driven by acoustic waves.

These relationships are often in the form of so-called scaling laws, giving an algebraic relationship between quantities that involves an exponent of one of the quantities that may measure the size of the system. As the system size grows, another system measure will change based on the scaling law. Such phenomena can be viewed as allometric scalings, since allometry has to do with the relationship between growth of parts of an organism and the growth of the organism itself. This project will study scaling laws in electric power distribution networks, and seek to determine whether such laws could be used to design more reliable power distribution systems. The design variables that could be considered include system parameters such as cable properties and structural aspects of the overall distribution network.<br/><br/>Allometric scalings are nonlinear, power-law relationships that govern system parameters and performance. Inspired by the remarkable allometric scalings in biology, initial work by the PI in collaboration with a colleague at Oxford University has resulted in evidence of allometric scaling in observed data for blackouts in distribution networks. Moreover, the initial work suggests physics and engineering design principles that could explain these scalings and relate distribution network parameters to its reliability in terms of the possibility that customers will be disconnected from the grid. Distribution networks must be redesigned and upgraded to accommodate renewable sources and new loads. The project seeks to establish and apply the new scaling theory to help ensure the reliability of the redesigned distribution networks."

These impacts will result in economic and social benefit and help the U.S. stay competitive globally. The theory and methodology will be integrated into education through modifications in related courses in order to engage graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project studies the uncertainty management and proactive maintenance of lithium ion batteries in electrified vehicles. The scope of the proposed work is to: i) increase accuracy of a baseline battery model; ii) develop an intelligent uncertainty management system; and iii) facilitate proactive maintenance decisions for lithium ion batteries. The investigators will address four issues including: i) characterization of battery model uncertainty under various battery operating conditions; ii) quantification of various uncertainties and their coupling effects in the battery system; iii) prediction of battery remaining useful life (RUL) under various battery operating conditions; and iv) validation of the proposed approaches on an electrified vehicle. Traditionally, researchers employ electrochemical models to improve battery model accuracy. However, a full order electrochemical model is not feasible for the battery management system (BMS) in electrified vehicles, and a significant level of model simplification must be established to meet the computational efficiency requirement which will cause unwanted model error. The first contribution of the research project will be to study an effective model uncertainty characterization approach to improve model prediction accuracy of a low-fidelity model (i.e., an equivalent circuit model) so that its accuracy is comparable to that of a high fidelity model (i.e., an electrochemical model) but with much higher computational efficiency. The second contribution of the project will be to develop an intelligent uncertainty management system for more effective battery performance estimation so that battery safety can be improved and lifetime risk minimized. Finally, the challenge of battery proactive maintenance stems from the complexity of battery devices. Even the best models cannot predict the complex degradation and failure mechanisms. As a result, accurate prediction of the battery RUL based on the underlying degradation theory is almost impossible. The third contribution of the research will be to study proactive maintenance decisions for batteries through accurate RUL prediction using innovative data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies."

New developing applications become possible given that the access to bandwidth increases.  These new applications are enabled by access to increased bandwidth, resulting in the consumption of more bandwidth and thus increasing the demand.  This results in a situation of ever increasing demands for bandwidth.   As the demand for bandwidth increases, new approaches in the distribution, transmission and processing of this bandwidth are required, thus generating the need for the development of new device technologies.  In addition, new system architectures may need to be considered based on emerging device technologies.  The development of new photonic technologies and approaches to communication, computing and signal processing are needed to keep ahead of the continually increasing demand for bandwidth. The significance and importance of developing new technologies and methods for communications, computing and signal processing is that these new devices and approaches will be more energy efficient, compact, and cost effective, resulting in applications and services that are broadband, ubiquitous and low cost. As these services become more ubiquitous and low cost, access to these high bandwidth environments will be accessible to a broad population, thus improving the overall intellectual and economic strength of the Nation.<br/>We propose to develop ultra-broadband optical communication and signal processing technologies relying on the unique properties of injection locked micro-cavity laser oscillators such as the Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser.  The approaches exploit the ability to simultaneously select single wavelength components from a multi-wavelength frequency comb laser, and realize high speed modulation or detection functionality.  These devices will then be used in an ultrafast coherent parallel signal processing architecture, realizing functionality ranging from format independent optical communications, optical sampling, optical arbitrary waveform generation and detection.  It is anticipated that multi-wavelength comb lasers combined with vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays could provide processing, communication and computing speeds of 5 terabits per second, equivalent to 1 million TV channels.  The intellectual significance is that the newly developed technologies will enable researchers to conceive of new approaches to the challenges of transmitting and processing massive amounts of data, which has been identified as one of the grand challenges in the 21 century.

The existing network technologies that support the current wireless data demand are expected to increase their capacity significantly in the next decade, calling for spectrum and energy efficient communication strategies. There are two popular approaches to efficiently utilize the RF spectrum: One is the cognitive radio networks which allow mobile users to share the spectrum that has been primarily allocated to other services such as television broadcasting, global position system (GPS), radar, weather forecasting, etc., provided that the mobile users impose limited interference to existing services. Another approach is to enhance the mobile broadband networks via expanded bandwidth, massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, and densified heterogeneous networks (HetNets). However, both approaches have limitations and have different impacts on spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. In addition, current hardware platforms exhibit formidable challenges in supporting high computational complexity and low power consumption. This project introduces a novel network architecture and its application-specific hardware optimization using neuromorphic computing devices. The new wireless network architecture allows mobile users to perform spatio-temporal spectrum sensing and actively search for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) opportunities to enable short-range and local communications. Meanwhile, neuromorphic computing devices that mimic bio-neurological processes will be designed to tackle the high computational complexity of the new dynamic spectrum access approach with extremely low power consumption.  In this way, we will be able to enable our nation's next-generation wireless communications and networking that are intelligent, spectrum-efficient, and energy-efficient in a dynamic spectrum environment. The developed concepts and technologies will also help achieve National Broadband Plan which targets at significant improvements in the efficiency of RF spectrum utilization. The project has an extensive education and outreach plan which includes designing new course components on energy-efficient communications, analog neuron circuits, and computational intelligence for wireless networks, joint training of graduate and undergraduate researchers between the two collaborative institutions, and outreach to telecommunication industry and underrepresented students through seminars and diversity programs.<br/><br/>Short-range and local communications are extremely beneficial for spectrum and energy efficiency. The research objective of the project is to 1) design DSA-enabled HetNets to enable short-range/local spectrum access to improve the spectrum and energy efficiency, and 2) leverage neuromorphic computing architecture to efficiently solve the associated resource allocation problems with extremely high energy efficiency. To achieve the goal, the project is organized into four interconnected research thrusts. Thrust 1 focuses on spatio-temporal spectrum sensing with MIMO transceivers.

Although battery-free micro-sensors can achieve inexpensive, long-lived and maintenance-free operation, these miniature sensors usually suffer from unwanted electromagnetic interferences, such as clutters, echoes, and multipath fading, which greatly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and the wireless interrogation range. To surmount these challenges, this research project will investigate a new class of self-powered, chemically-tuned harmonic transponders as wireless biosensors. The harmonic biosensor consists of all-graphene antenna and integrated circuit (graphene is, basically, a single atomic layer of graphite), which can be made transparent, light-weight, flexible, and biocompatible for medical applications, thus making possible a contact lens sensor for low-cost, portable, and continuous diagnosis of pathogen bacteria, proteins, and versatile biomolecular markers. The proposed wireless bio-sensing technology may lead to various applications, such as detection of viral eye infections, ocular surface tumors, and intraocular pressure. In addition, the project will also integrate the research into the new courses and outreach activities in Wayne State University (e.g., ReBUILDetroit Program, Richard Barber Interdisciplinary Research Program, and WSU STEM Days) for recruiting under-represented and K-12 students in the Detroit metropolitan area and promoting their interest in pursuing a career in radio-frequency (RF) engineering and biomedical electronics. <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to investigate the low-noise, energy-efficient wireless micro-sensor system based on all-graphene RF- and bio-electronics. The key scientific advance of this research lies in the harmonics-based bio-sensing technique, which uses a fully passive and chemically reconfigurable transponder as a harmonic biosensor to achieve real-time and long-range wireless bio-sensing. Fundamentally different from conventional backscatter sensors, the harmonic biosensor, launching and detecting signals of orthogonal frequencies, can enable longer detection range against electromagnetic interferences and human-body backscatter clutters. The harmonic biosensor can be realized with a simple graphene-based bioelectronic circuit which combines functions of a biosensor and a frequency multiplier into a single module, based on the unique ambipolar and tunable electronic properties of graphene transistors. Moreover, this bio-sensitive RF transponder can be connected to a transparent, dual-band graphene antenna placed onto the flexible biocompatible substrate. The selective binding of biomolecules, such as infectious or bio-threat agents, on the graphene harmonic biosensor can be wirelessly monitored by launching a monotone RF signal and detecting the strength of the backscattered second harmonic, as the frequency conversion efficiency is altered by the biomolecular concentration. If successful, the compact and transparent graphene harmonic biosensor can be integrated on the soft contact lens to sensitively detect targeted pathogen bacteria, infectious agents, diseases, or metabolic changes of interest, and wirelessly transmit data without any power source or sophisticated circuit. With further development, the proposed wireless biosensors can have broad impacts in healthcare monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Boron nitride is member of the family of semiconductors known as III-nitrides, which consist of nitrogen and a Group III element such as aluminum, gallium, and indium. This family of materials has realized the solid-state lighting industry and revolutionized microwave communications. Cubic boron nitride is an ultra-wide bandgap material, transparent to visible light and absorbing only in the deep ultraviolet. It could have a transformative impact on power electronics for electric vehicles, smart grids, and space technologies. Its exceptional hardness, high thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance could also allow this material to replace diamond in harsh environments. Studies of boron nitride will also contribute to fundamental knowledge of III-nitride semiconductors. The project is a collaboration between Howard and Morgan State University, two Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs). The project enables Morgan and Howard students to participate in a cutting edge technology with commercial implications. The project explicitly engages both graduate students and undergraduates in ""hands on"" research activities. The project will fund senior design projects at Morgan and Howard, where students will translate physical electronics discoveries into real systems. The project will encourage greater minority participation in graduate research programs at HBCUs. <br/><br/><br/>To realize the full potential of cubic boron nitride (c-BN), it is desirable to have both n-type and p-type conduction enabling bipolar devices as well as Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) logic. It has been demonstrated that shallow n-type (silicon doping), and p-type (beryllium doping) are possible, making c-BN a unique outlier among ultrawide bandgap materials (UWBGs). In this work, we investigate doping and compensation strategies to evaluate the promise of c-BN.  In addition we measure physical properties of this material such as mobility and breakdown field as a function of defect morphology (updating historical data as necessary). The work involves both small (<1 mm) commercial single-crystal c-BN samples, as well as large area thin films grown at Morgan State. All measurements will be interpreted by comparing with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations that provide a true atomic physics-based understanding. One of the challenges of the work will be to produce polytypic pure material. In order to accomplish this during chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the less stable hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) polymorph is etched or sputtered away allowing the production of the cubic phase. We will test 3 methods to do this: i) etching by H2, ii) use of fluorine-based precursors and iii) ion-beam assistance, on single-crystal HPHT diamond substrates. Surface preparation and post-annealing will be guided by DFT calculations. Compensation and doping by intrinsic point defects (e.g. vacancies) are likely to play a strong role in this UWBG material, and DFT will be a critical tool to understanding the origin of the doping, and electrical transport.

Therefore, it could leverage the mature Si3N4 low-loss waveguide technology to produce similar low-loss waveguide-based passive components by drop-in replacing quartz wafers with sapphire wafers. For RF applications, the sapphire platform has a potential to obtain much higher dynamic range due to low-loss optical waveguides while the competing Si-photonics platform combined with off-chip 1.55 micron laser suffers from the strong two-photon absorption and therefore has a limited dynamic range.  As a transparent substrate, sapphire would enable a versatile 3-D photonics/electronics integration architecture. This project aims to, first, study the ""feasibility"" of the proposed approach by identifying and investigating key ""fundamental challenges"", then, conduct a proof-of-concept study to provide an effective route for overcoming the identified obstacles, and, eventually, provide a conclusive recommendation as to whether the proposed research is feasible. As a fully integrated solution to fundamentally address the most important technical challenge in IMWP, if successful, the new platform would find tremendous applications in defense systems, such as Radar signal processing, and many civilian applications. The broad wavelength coverage enables on-chip sensing applications.  It could potentially replace the current Si-photonics for datacom and be used in harsh environments such as space and nuclear applications."

Even less progress has been made on circuits that use light to process information.  A key impediment to progress on true electronic-photonic integration has been the lack of a circuit element that operates in both the domain of light (photons) and electrons.  An important breakthrough, made at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign by Professors Nick Holonyak, Jr. and Milton Feng, is that certain types of transistors (the basic building blocks of electronic circuits) can be modified to generate and be acted on by light.  These light-emitting transistors (LETs) and transistor lasers (TLs) will be used in this program to form true electronic-photonic digital logic circuits, and high-speed optical links both on and between chips.  This technology is expected to dramatically improve the speed and energy efficiency of devices that process information, and to enable the commercial success of a new class of integrated circuits at the forefront of performance.  Education and outreach activities will introduce undergraduates and high school teachers to a new technology based on light, renewing excitement in STEM-related fields and the creating the promise for a future career in electronic-photonic circuit engineering.<br/><br/>The technical work in this program is focused on bringing into existence a basic electronic-photonic circuit that can be used as the core building block for ultra-energy-efficient electronic-photonic computing systems.

At the fundamental level, physics-based models will be developed for the devices to optimize them for electronic and photonic functionality and predict their performance in an electronic-photonic circuit.  In tandem, devices and circuits will be fabricated and characterized to optimize their performance and to improve the device models.  Incorporating these devices and circuits into systems with conventional silicon circuits will require the development of scalable processing technologies that allow the formation of electronic-photonic ""islands"" embedded within silicon chips along with the electronic and photonic interconnects within and between these islands.  Finally, architectures will be developed at the chip and system level that make optimal use of the functionality provided by these electronic-photonic logic circuits."

Such applications include coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles that operate in variable atmospheric conditions, concepts for relocatable marine hydrokinetic energy systems that operate in a varying ocean environment, and airborne wind energy systems that operate in an atmospheric environment where the wind varies with respect to both time and vertical position. This research will focus on deriving general theory that will be relevant to a variety of applications, along with the validation of these results on an airborne wind energy system. In airborne wind energy systems, the conventional tower is replaced by tethers and a lifting body (a wing or aerostat) that elevates a horizontal-axis turbine to high altitudes. Because the tether lengths can be adjusted, the operating altitude can be varied to optimally harness the wind resource. The work will include a substantial complementary educational component, wherein graduate, undergraduate, and STEM high school students will utilize NREL's Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software to optimize renewable/storage/dispatchable network configurations for microgrids in North Carolina and California.<br/><br/>This research will derive new control theoretic knowledge and tools for the systems that operate in a spatiotemporally varying and partially observable environment. While optimal control in a temporally varying environment is a well-studied problem that can be addressed through Markov models, the addition of a spatial component results in an explosion in the number of states, rendering Markov-based methods computationally infeasible in most cases. Furthermore, the presence of partial observability results in a fundamental tradeoff between exploration (obtaining knowledge of the spatial environment) and exploitation (operating at the most favorable locations). To address the complexities of this spatiotemporal optimization problem, this research will explore the use of a multi-rate, multi-scale hierarchical framework. Specifically, an upper-level controller will perform a global optimization over a very coarse grid (thereby rendering the optimization computationally tractable), and a lower-level optimization will perform adjustments on a much finer grid. The research will focus on model predictive control for the upper-level optimization and will explore the use of extremum seeking and model predictive control strategies at the lower level. Control algorithms will be validated on a model of a lighter-than-air airborne wind energy system, using real wind shear profile models and load demand data. In this airborne wind energy system, the wind speed is only measurable at the system?s operating altitude (thereby making the problem partially observable), and significant energy production improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude.<br/>uction improvements can be realized through the optimal adjustment of the operating altitude."

Cascading failures, where the failure of one or few components causes a wide-spread failure of the interconnected system, is a major cause of blackouts in power grids. The mechanism of such failures is highly complex as it involves the physical layer of the grid (e.g. generators, transmission lines, etc.) and the cyber layer (e.g. communication and control elements) in a coupled manner. This is a very important problem to investigate as cascading failures can cost our economy billions of dollars. This project takes a holistic view at taming cascading failures in electrical energy CPS. The proposed research has two tightly coupled thrust areas. Thrust 1 aims at an accurate understanding of the cascading failure mechanism and its prevention, while Thrust 2 focuses on recovery following blackouts under uncertainty of failure locations. Theory of trajectory sensitivity and graph theory are leveraged to develop a fundamental understanding of cascading failures in energy CPS, which can be applied to other CPSs where the physical system is dynamic in nature and the failure propagation in the physical system and the cyber system are coupled. The proposed preventive control strategy can protect critical infrastructures from large-scale failures and facilitate higher resiliency, whereas the proposed recovery strategy is applicable in the aftermath of a blackout caused by cascades, natural disasters, or other events, which will reduce downtime of the critical infrastructure. In support of the Broadening Participation in Computing initiative among women, the proposed research will be integrated into the one-week summer camps offered by the School of EECS at Penn State. Presentations about this research will be given to high school girls over the course of one week in the 2019 camps, and then camps focused on curriculum on the topic of this research will be offered in 2020 and 2021.<br/><br/>The proposed research has two key objectives (a) develop an accurate understanding of the cascading failure mechanism and its prevention, and (b) develop a recovery plan following blackouts under uncertainty of failure locations and budget constraints. The quasi-steady-state (QSS) model of power grid used in literature for studying cascade propagation produces inaccurate results towards the later stages of blackouts, whereas a fully dynamic model is impractical for large-scale statistical analyses. To solve this, a 'temporally hybrid' and a 'spatio-temporally hybrid' model are proposed, which quantify the stress of the grid at the systems level and the component level, respectively, using trajectory sensitivity theory, and appropriately switch from the QSS to the dynamic model. Next, a unified graph-based model for interdependent power grid and communication systems is developed, which takes into account several special features of the legacy Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system along with the modern Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection, and Controls (WAMPAC) system, and the observability and controllability they provide for the CPS. Furthermore, a stability-constrained remedial action scheme for cascade prevention is proposed. Finally, a new approach for progressive assessment and recovery, which leverages the hybrid power grid models and the unified communication network model, is proposed in the presence of budget constraints and failure uncertainties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposal is separated into three aims: 1) develop calcium sensors and optogenetic channels active on different wavelength ranges to allow simultaneous readout and control, 2) develop a dual-beam two photon microscope, and 3) develop imaging software that can process neural activity in real-time. <br/><br/>Nontechnical abstract <br/>Understanding neural function requires examining specific subsets of the vast numbers of neurons in the brain. Recently developed optogenetics tools, such as optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging, have partially fulfilled the need to target these specific sets of neurons and study their function. These techniques deliver engineered genes to targeted neural populations, and use light to manipulate or measure neural activity. Current optogenetic tools lack the spatiotemporal resolution to causally study many individual neurons in parallel on fast time scales; they only make broad conclusions either on near-millimeter sized brain regions, or over the timescale of many action potentials. We propose to integrate the design and implementation of optical and genetic tools to greatly refine the scale of investigating neural activity. Specifically, we will create two optically independent channels: one channel for fast, spatially precise optical patterning to control individual neurons; and one channel for independent recording of neural activity from individual neurons. We will then integrate these two channels by creating software that instantaneously patterns optical excitation based on the optical recording. Integrative design and engineering of this expansive set of tools will enable neuroscientists to quickly manipulate and control large populations of single neurons, a capability that does not exist presently. Our technology will allow the community to directly explore how neural activity patterns of many individual neurons in one brain region drive downstream neural activity. This novel probing of functional connectivity is exactly the type of study needed to better understand the coordination of neural activity in healthy and diseased brains. Beyond the specific application of neuroscience, training students within our multidisciplinary setting will create the next generation of scientists capable of tackling the broad set of technical challenges facing society today. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/>Optical imaging of brain activity has steadily developed into a staple technique within neuroscience labs over the past decade. In combination with genetically encoded sensors of neural activity, optical methods enable genetic targeting and chronic, simultaneous imaging of many individual neurons. One significant weakness of existing optical techniques when compared to electrophysiology is the inability to simultaneously measure and control the activity of a neuron in real time. We propose to address this shortcoming by developing an optical imaging system and data processing software suite that will enable real-time optical readout of neural activity and real-time neural feedback via optical excitation, all with cellular level specificity and in parallel over a large population of neurons. This new ability to optically record and manipulate many genetically or functionally specified neurons individually will augment current studies using bulk neural activation or inhibition; the fine scale perturbations of neurons will tease apart the details of neural circuits. Specifically, we will engineer a set of optogenetic actuators, fluorescent sensors, and microscopy tools that will enable optical readout and control of neurons in different wavelength channels. We will also develop fast image processing algorithms that quickly convert images to neural activity of individual neurons, thereby enabling real-time control of neural activity based on the optical readout. Recently, improvements to these tools occurred independently. Our proposal will address the integrated development of the tool set, and effectively employ trade-offs between the individual components. For example, simultaneous engineering of the protein sensor, imaging processing software, and optical imaging hardware will optimize the readout fidelity. Similarly, joint design of the genetic tools? spectral separation and the optical spatiotemporal resolution will extend optical control precision. Integration of these developments to examine neural function at the cellular level is unprecedented: successful advancement of this research will enable novel examination of the brain and help guide targeted biomedical therapies."

Power electronics play critical roles in renewable energy integration, computing and telecommunication, grid-scale energy storage, and transportation electrification, all at the edge of the future smart grid. These emerging energy systems are usually modular and granular. This research project targets a generalized design method that will enable a new family of power electronics that can achieve high performance and perform new functions at the grid edge for a variety of applications. ``Granular power electronics'' represents a systematic design approach that pushes the intelligence and capability of power electronics to a granular level that has not been demonstrated before. The PI will leverage the recent advances in wide-band-gap devices, circuit architectures, and control methodologies to address the challenges of controlling sophisticated power flow, modeling magnetics with granular structures, and addressing the inverter-to-inverter oscillation problem in nano-grids with many smart inverters. The results of this project will be incorporated into the efforts that the PI is currently leading as a part of the ""Campus-as-a-Lab"" program to create research opportunities for undergraduate students. The outreach program for K-12 students, involving them in the development of experimental demos, will expose them to the role of power electronics in improving the quality and sustainability of our daily lives and attract them to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The PI will perform a systematic investigation on the fundamental principles of granular and modular power electronics.

The PI will use three emerging and important energy systems at the grid edge as examples - smart inverters (distributed energy generation), large scale energy systems (data center power delivery), and a nano-grid test platform for multidisciplinary energy systems research. High performance grid-interface power electronics topologies will be studied, and model-based multi-agent control strategies will be developed to enable a future smart grid with many granular power electronics at the edge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The systems in these applications need to shrink system components and achieve light weight and high efficiency simultaneously. These goals of power electronic systems can be accomplished by multiple improvements of power modules such as lower loss, higher frequency, higher temperature and downsizing. In order to make breakthrough in these demands for power modules, it is important to replace the device material from Silicon (Si) to the next generation ones such as Silicon-Carbon (SiC) or Gallium Nitride (GaN). Although the low voltage SiC power device is expected to replace the Silicon device with the rapid increase of market adoption of SiC technology, Silicon device are still dominant in high-voltage high-power applications. The goal of this research is to develop the high voltage high current SiC module based on the existing commercially available device technology to enable the use of SiC-based semiconductors in the high-voltage high-power conversion systems. System benefits such as improved efficiency, reduced part count along with reduced size and weight should make this technology attractive for adoption in these applications. The comprehensive nature of this project will also support a multi-faceted program of research training, with impact at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The outcome of this project will be disseminated through the undergraduate and graduate courses to prepare the students for future careers. <br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to significantly improve the efficiency and power density of high-voltage high-power conversion systems. To achieve the goal, the proposed approach is to replace the high voltage Si IGBT (3.3kV, 4.5kV, 6.5kV) by series and parallel connected low voltage SiC MOSFETs (1.2kV, 1.7kV). Specifically, a game changing and universally applicable standard block of ""series-parallel connected SiC MOSFET"" will be developed with excellent dynamic voltage/current sharing and high reliability. In order to reach this objective, it is worth noting that the series-parallel connections of multiple devices have the following design challenges that must be addressed: unequal static and dynamic voltage/current sharing which is normally due to the part-to-part device parameter variations, the gate loop parasitic differences, the gate resistor tolerance, the isolation level differences and the signal transmission channel to channel delays; immunity to the conventional de-saturation protection for short-circuit failure; excessive voltage ringing due to the additional loop inductance contributed by the connected bus bars between devices. The advanced methods are proposed to be integrated into the block to overcome these challenges. The feasibility and advantages of the standard block will be demonstrated in the power-down-scaled medium voltage drive, medium voltage PV power conversion, Extreme Fast Charging (XFC) station medium voltage power conversion prototypes. Except for that, the technology will be applied to GaN device to form high voltage high current GaN module competing with the single SiC MOSFET as well and the efficiency/density benefits will be demonstrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This platform, once realized, is believed to make a significant impact on medical sensing paradigms by offering flexibility in remote and nonintrusive measurement of patients vital signs. Despite the tremendous technological progress made in the field of microelectronics during the past few decades, there exists a gap between the scale of sensing apparatus used in medical industry and the state-of-the-art in the field of miniaturized sensors. Specifically, the devices monitoring respiration rate and breathing pattern are inconvenient for the patients due to excessive wiring. The platform proposed in this project can significantly scale down the size of the equipment required for monitoring breathing rate. The same technology can be adapted for continuous monitoring of the temperature (including the core body temperature), the heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen intake, etc. without the need for changing the battery.

In this work, for the first time, whispering-gallery mode phononic cavities in a piezoelectric-on-ultrananocrystalline diamond platform will be demonstrated with the goal of achieving high coupling factor and high quality factor at high frequencies around 1 GHz. The whispering gallery mode is chosen to evade the anchor-loss (a major source of energy loss) and the diamond substrate is chosen to minimize the effect of internal friction losses at high frequencies. Such large values of coupling and Q could enable extremely-small size (< 1 cm x 1 cm including the antenna) wireless sensors with a readout range of a few meters. The tasks include: 1) Studying the physics of loss in high frequency piezoelectric-on-diamond resonators, 2) Implementation of whispering-gallery mode phononic cavities in the thin-film piezoelectric-on-diamond platform, 3) Integration of the phononic cavities with highly-efficient electrically-small antennas to develop passive wireless sensors. Such sensors can be orders of magnitude smaller than other wireless sensors operating at similar frequencies.

This explosive growth has created a capacity crisis for mobile operators whose impact goes well beyond the inconveniences experienced by casual users. Wireless communication is now a commodity, like roads, water, and electricity, on which the nation's economic development and government services rely. Emergency services, medical information systems, environmental monitoring, smart-grid energy distribution, smart transportation systems - all of these technologies depend on reliable access to high speed broadband wireless. It is clear that dramatic improvements in spectral access and capacity will be needed soon to accommodate the multitude of users who need broadband services anytime, anywhere. This proposal aims to address this critical need by determining how to harness potential gains from three new technologies: (1) the use of very high frequency bands, 10-20 times higher than those used in today's wireless networks, (2) decreasing the size of wireless ""cells"" to allow frequencies to be reused in a more dense fashion, and (3) the adoption of massive arrays of hundreds of antennas in order to handle the inevitable increase in interference and need for user selectivity.  There appears to be considerable symbiosis among these new technologies that could potentially be exploited to achieve transformative gains in network speed and connectivity - increasing them by a factor of 1000 - although numerous challenges would have to first be vercome.  Given the ubiquitous need for improved broadband access in industry, government, medicine and the home, the progress made by this research in overcoming these challenges will have a broad impact on all walks of life. <br/><br/>A potential remedy for the shortage of spectrum is the use of millimeter wave frequency bands, which offer significantly more bandwidth than today's systems. Other approaches for increasing wireless capacity are also rekindling interest in the potential use of millimeter wave frequencies for cellular communications, such as using pico- and femto-cells with ranges on the order of 10-200 meters to increase frequency reuse, and the idea of basestations equipped with a very large number of antennas that can simultaneously accommodate many co-channel users, an idea referred to as massive multi-input multi-output wireless.  These ideas work well in combination with each other: smaller cells are attractive for operation at millimeter wave frequencies where radio frequency path loss is significantly higher, the shorter wavelength associated with higher frequencies is appealing for massive multi-input multi-output wireless designs since the physical dimensions of the antenna array and associated electronics are reduced, the large beamforming gains achievable with very large antenna arrays can extend coverage to help overcome the high millimeter wave path loss, and the reduction in channel coherence time at millimeter wave frequencies is offset by the lower mobility and hence the higher channel coherence bandwidth due to operation in small cells. If the individual gains in capacity offered by these approaches could be achieved in combination with one another, then one could envision realizing the orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput that are predicted to be required in coming years. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the feasibility implementing a millimeter wave massive multi-input multi output system incorporating in excess of 100 antennas, addressing issues associated with millimeter wave signal propagation, communication system design, the impact of communication and signal processing requirements on the hardware design, and how practical hardware limitations affect achievable performance. Ultimately, this research effort will demonstrate the degree to which millimeter wave small-cell massive multi-input multi-output wireless systems can achieve their potential for dramatically enhanced access to the radio spectrum. No prior work has fully addressed the interdisciplinary issues associated with implementing a complete millimeter wave massive multi-input multi-output wireless transceiver, covering crucial aspects such as the impact of antenna array geometries, demodulation, baseband processing, sampling and multichannel data aggregation. Prior efforts have been restricted to scenarios with a small number of antennas, lower frequencies, or hybrid architectures in which full beamforming flexibility is not available. There are many interdisciplinary challenges that must be addressed before a system that jointly exploits millimeter wave frequencies, massive multi-input multi-output wireless and small cells could be analyzed and its potential for providing enhanced spectrum access quantified. The enormous gains in capacity and spectral efficiency that could be provided by a millimeter wave massive multi-input multi-output wireless system could have a revolutionary effect on wireless applications. This impact includes not only consumer applications, but those involving emergency services, medical information systems, environmental monitoring, smart-grid energy distribution, smart transportation systems - all technologies that rely on access to high-speed broadband wireless services."

It will also provide early detection of potentially hazardous situations and enable better quality of life for an aging population.  As the number and density of connected devices have increased, electromagnetic spectrum at widely used frequency bands of 5 GHz and below has become increasingly crowded and congested.  At the same time, reducing the power consumption and physical size of each individual sensor node is important to keep the network hardware unobtrusive and more easily deployable. This project seeks to bridge the power and size gap by enabling resource-aware wireless communication network with energy harvesting sensor nodes where available energy can have immense variation and utilize higher frequency spectrum at 24 GHz.  The reconfigurable transceivers of network sensor nodes will be capable of maintaining critical services when available power is scarce while taking advantage of higher power levels when power is abundant, with automatically adaptable roles within the greater network based upon how that available power is distributed.  This project also includes several educational activities such as STEM workshops for K-12 students, research experiences for undergraduates, and course development.  An entrepreneurial seminar and site visit series with local startup companies will provide real examples for undergraduate and graduate students to learn how to transform laboratory ideas to real-world applications while benefiting their local communities.<br/><br/>The project will investigate fundamental challenges at several layers in the hardware hierarchy of wireless sensor network.  These will range from link and network considerations, such as adapting the link requirements based on node- or network-level power availability, down to reconfigurable transceiver blocks that enable higher level functionality in physical layer.  These transceiver blocks include multi-mode receivers that can dynamically trade off power for data rate or sensitivity in real time as well as transmitters that are highly efficient even at significant back-off power levels.  Additionally, the project will push ultra-low power wireless operation to higher frequencies in K-band (e.g., 24 GHz), which alleviates the issue of limited spectrum at lower frequencies, while also allowing for drastically reduced antenna size with the same efficiency. The project will also advance the co-design between the radio electronics and the electromagnetics including impedance matching networks and antennas engineered for low-power, high-frequency, high-impedance conditions.  The fundamental studies and underlying design principles developed in this project will be demonstrated with proof-of-concept wireless sensor nodes.  This project will also advance the implementation of dynamically asymmetric links and role selection in a mesh network of symmetric wireless sensor nodes to optimize the network functionality based on available power.  The research has important impacts because it will bring together traditionally siloed design spaces, and leverage fundamental research within RF, ultra-low power circuits, and antenna design to address critical bottlenecks in deployment of future wireless sensor networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in manipulating the spin of an electron and the associated magnetic moment, recognized by the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics, were crucial for a dramatic increase in the capacity of computer hard drives using spin-valves. Such spin-valves rely on the concept of magnetoresistance in which the magnetic configuration of a device determines if the current flow is permitted or restricted. While spin-valves remain valuable for magnetically storing and sensing information, they are of limited use for signal processing and digital logic; it would be crucial to consider practical paths to other spin-based device schemes.  One such opportunity is afforded in this proposal by reexamining how to improve semiconductor lasers, widely used in DVDs, optical communication, and medicine. In commercial semiconductor lasers, a sufficiently large number of electrons and holes, having an opposite charge, are generated and the excess charge carriers recombine to emit coherent photons that possess the same wavelength and phase. Although photons, electrons and holes all have spin, the working principle of conventional semiconductor lasers is completely unaffected by them, because there is no net imbalance between spins pointing in different directions ('up' and 'down'). The proposed work will provide a closely integrated educational and outreach efforts by organizing a week-long Summer Workshop on Lasers, experiment and theory for high school students  and organizing symposia to bridge the gap between the spintronics and optics communities at the annual SPIE Optics and Photonics Conference.<br/><br/>The proposed research builds on recent experimental advances demonstrating that the operation of lasers can be strongly modified by optically or electrically injecting spin-polarized carriers, having thus a spin imbalance. In the steady-state and low-frequency operation changing the polarization of injected carriers in such spin-lasers has already enabled: (a) lasing threshold reduction and enhanced emission intensity as compared to their conventional (spin-unpolarized) counterparts; (b) strong modulation of the emitted light, even at a fixed injection intensity. The most important applications of spin-lasers are still largely unexplored and pertain to an ultrafast operation and their superior dynamical performance. The bandwidth in conventional lasers is typically limited by the relaxation oscillation frequency. However, spin-lasers should enable a large increase in oscillation frequency , and) a novel and much higher frequency scale governing the polarization oscillation of the emitted light. The PI will develop a detailed modeling of spin-lasers and explore how to: (1) tailor the resonant cavity anisotropy to achieve dynamical bandwidths > 100 GHz, (2) reduce parasitic frequency modulation-chirp, and (3) improve switching properties and digital operation;  and validate with the experimental data. The PI will study alternative device geometries focused on the recent advances in GaN spin-nanolasers. Conventional metallic interconnects are recognized as the bottleneck in Moore's law scaling and the main source of power dissipation. Since optical interconnects, having lasers as their key element, could address the underlying limitations, this work on spin-lasers may have transformative character and enable novel interconnects."

A great proportion of the communications performed in the IoT will be between devices, in so-called machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and in an increasingly automated manner.  The environments in which IoT devices will operate will often be more complex, cluttered and challenging for wireless communications than either today's ubiquitous mobile communications or wireless data networks.   This research addresses a critical component of the IoT wireless communications link, namely the antenna systems for these small, inexpensive devices. New antenna designs are needed, along with new methods for low-cost digital manufacturing and for testing the devices under realistic operating conditions. The research findings of this project have potential to positively impact the robustness of not only M2M systems but also systems utilized in dynamic environments such vehicle-to-vehicle, first-responder and military field operations. Furthermore, the underlying knowledge could influence the future designs of medical devices, on-body sensor systems, robotic systems, un-manned ground and air vehicles and similar applications where customization, form factor, production volume or other considerations make direct digital manufacturing (DDM) an attractive option. Graduate students from the University of Vermont and the University of South Florida will collaborate with the industry participants from Harris Corporation. The investigators will also work closely with STEM programs targeting high school students, in particular those students from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations, to develop activities that provide insights on the foundations that make wireless communications possible. <br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to techniques and technology that enable wireless devices for Internet of Things (IoT) applications operating at 2.45, 5 and 60 GHz to determine and adapt to the channel impairments using new antenna system designs.  Advanced manufacturing and integration approaches will be studied with the goal of reducing the size and cost of these devices and systems.  The intellectual merit lies in the fusion of ideas from propagation modeling, antenna design and direct digital manufacturing (DDM).  Previous work by the investigators, who have a long and productive history of collaboration, has contributed new understanding of channel conditions for highly cluttered environments, 3D antenna designs, and the use of DDM for microwave circuit and antenna fabrication. The work will leverage this expertise in the investigation of new channel models and the resulting theory that will inform the study of next generation, adaptive antenna systems. A new approach to quantifying antenna system performance based on collecting and analyzing antenna responses to a wide range of channel conditions is the basis for the proposed propagation studies. The orientation, spacing and reconfiguration of antenna elements in a multi-polarization system will be studied using a statistical characterization method. Advanced DDM processes will be investigated using a unique 3D printer that combines plastic extrusion, paste micro-dispensing and laser processing in a single tool.  The new processes will provide the ability to realize 3D structural electronics that comprise package-integrated antenna systems that include ferroelectric tuning networks. The realization of electronically-tunable DDM devices requires a new process to merge a technology with length scales on the order of 10's of microns (DDM) with one having length scales on the order of microns (integrated circuits). The eventual goal of demonstrating, in collaboration with GOALI partner Harris Corp., high performance mm-wave (60 GHz) antenna systems of this nature necessitates tight control over feature sizes and the quality and surface features of printed conductors; the use of pulsed laser processing will be studied as a means to address these challenges."

As battery costs have decreased, more small-scale distributed batteries have been connected to the network to provide local services. These resources could be aggregated and used to provide grid services when not needed for their local service. Similarly, flexible loads can be aggregated and coordinated to behave like storage and provide multiple services simultaneously. Stacking services improves storage utilization and economics in addition to the ability of the grid to accommodate more renewables, improving its environmental and health impacts along with energy security. The research objective of this proposal is to develop a suite of computationally-tractable optimization and control algorithms that will enable aggregators to optimally coordinate thousands of highly-heterogeneous and distributed small-scale storage resources and loads to provide stacked services. The findings will impact energy policy, specifically the regulations surrounding stacked services.  The PI's overall educational objectives are to inspire students to tackle the grand challenges of climate change and energy security, develop curricula that simultaneously teaches electric power systems and builds students' fundamental STEM skills, and increase public awareness and understanding of modern challenges and opportunities in power systems. To this end, the education plan includes four activities: i) international education and outreach in Liberia; ii) public education and outreach via the development of an online energy storage game highlighting the opportunities and challenges associated with distributed energy storage; iii) graduate and undergraduate education; and iv) outreach to practitioners, researchers, and policymakers via short courses, webinars, and talks. The educational activities will promote workforce development through curricular innovation at University of Michigan and the University of Liberia, and outreach to Liberian K-12 and undergraduate women. <br/><br/>The research objective is challenging because the power system is uncertain, nonlinear, and high dimensional; sensing and communication systems required for storage coordination are imperfect; and coordination must not negatively impact the distribution network. The research will develop i) stochastic optimization approaches to schedule aggregations of distributed storage to provide stacked services, while managing storage nonconvexities; ii) robust predictive nonlinear control approaches to coordinate aggregations of distributed storage to provide stacked services, leveraging novel aggregate storage models capturing degradation dynamics; iii) aggregate load models (identified with experimental data) representing load flexibility as storage, including the efficiency and degradation associated with load coordination actions and the model error resulting from the use of approximate storage-type models; and iv) optimization/control approaches to coordinate highly-heterogeneous storage and load aggregations. The results will be validated in high-fidelity simulation environments and the most promising approaches will be implemented in a realistic physical test bed. Methodologically, the research will develop i) novel stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) methods for nonconvex models, leveraging emerging extensions of SDDP to integer programming problems, and ii) novel robust predictive control methods that integrate sliding mode control and model predictive control. While past work has proposed methods of combining sliding and model predictive control, they require online optimization whereas we seek a control policy for fast online computation.

The lifespan of underwater systems varies from a few years to decades, while the spatiotemporal dynamics of underwater acoustic environments at multiple scales pose grand challenges to efficient and reliable acoustic data transmission. The objective of this project is to develop a fundamental and systematic online-learning-based framework for underwater acoustic communications and networking, where the underwater acoustic system 1) models and predicts the long-term dynamics of the acoustic environment, and 2) proactively adapts its communication and networking strategy to the dynamics of the environment, thereby maximizing the long-term system performance in the aspects of energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, and transmission reliability. Through explicit learning about its environment, the proposed framework will allow harmonious co-existence with other acoustic systems, including marine animals, to achieve eco-friendly operation. This project's research will be integrated with education through summer youth K-12 outreach, curriculum development, undergraduate and graduate student training that will be particularly tailored to females and underrepresented minorities, and collaboration with an underwater robotics team from the local Dollar Bay High School. These activities are designed to motivate and better train rural, female, minority, and economically disadvantaged students to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/>This project tackles fundamental challenges in online-learning-based underwater acoustic communications and networking by innovating across three interrelated domains. First, novel signal processing and sparse learning techniques will be developed to model and predict the large-scale dynamics and the statistical distribution of small-scale fading of underwater acoustic environments, including the acoustic transmission loss, ambient soundscape, and statistical characterization of external (anthropogenic and marine animal) acoustic sources. Second, an optimization framework will be developed, based on the acoustic environment prediction, for joint transmission power control, link scheduling, node-cooperative routing, and autonomous vehicle mobility control to achieve high network utility and harmonious coexistence with other acoustic systems. Third, the acoustic environment exploration-exploitation tradeoff will be tackled in the Bayesian reinforcement learning framework, which will provide a principled approach to weighing the immediate reward of a communication and networking strategy and its associated long-term benefit of revealing the environment's dynamics. Leveraging the geographic advantage of Michigan Tech and the state-of-the-art facilities of Michigan Tech's Great Lakes Research Center, extensive field experiments will be conducted for acoustic measurement collection and for offline and online algorithm evaluation in a software-defined networking architecture.

Recent radio spectrum measurements have corroborated the fact that the radio spectrum is being used inefficiently; and consequently, the concept of cognitive radio has been proposed as a promising approach for the efficient utilization of the radio frequency spectrum. A cognitive radio represents a communication system equipped with the abilities to learn its surrounding environment through sensing and measurements and to adapt its features for a better utilization of existing radio frequency spectrum resources with the aim of securing communications links with adequate quality of service. This proposal addresses several important problems that must be overcome before cognitive radio systems can be implemented in practice. These challenges include the design of circuits with adequate precision for processing of the received signals, the design of fast and computationally efficient ways to sense the occupancy of the spectrum and the design and analysis of multiple access schemes that will permit many users to share the spectrum without causing undue interference to each other. This project will use innovative techniques to solve these challenges thereby enabling a better utilization of the available radio spectrum resources. Applications of the proposed work include radio astronomy, communication networks, smart grids, wireless sensing and monitoring devices, remote monitoring of earth, and telemedicine.<br/><br/>This project will design interference-resilient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based cognitive networks and optimize their performance for better utilization of the radio frequency spectrum. The objective is to develop transformative solutions and approaches by unveiling and exploiting cross-disciplinary concepts and results from mixed analog/digital signal processing, fast spectrum sensing, computational statistics and stochastic geometry with significant impact to both theory and practice. Successful completion of this project holds the potential to advance the state-of-the-art knowledge and understanding in the deployment and optimization of spectrum sharing communications networks. This project will develop new algorithms and methodologies to optimize the design of a radio frequency front-end and analog-to-digital converters in the presence of primary user interference, and multiple-access schemes to mitigate secondary user interference. This project will also contribute to the development of large-scale simulation and computational methods for enhancing the operation of cognitive wireless communications networks. The proposed research work will be integrated with the educational mission through the development of innovative pedagogical practices, advising of students, active recruitment of domestic students and students from under-represented groups.

However, new semiconductor lasers with extended capabilities, such as high optical power emission, lower input-power requirements, and the ability to operate in wavelength regions that are difficult to access with commonly used semiconductor materials are still under intense development by researchers. The technologies developed in this program will provide new commercial product opportunities by enabling semiconductor lasers to operate with high performance under continuous current operation, in the technologically important mid-infrared wavelength region, that is currently difficult to access. High-performance compact light sources (lasers) operating in the mid-infrared wavelength region are ideal for remote gas sensing, laser-based range finding, free-space optical communication, product marking of materials such as plastics, and medical/dental applications. A case in point, environmental monitoring (remote sensing) of methane represents a potentially large volume application for the proposed devices, since methane is a major source of radiative forcing with a global warming potential 25 times greater than CO2.  For many of these applications, practical requirements in terms of cost, size, weight, performance and reliability preclude any other technology from being a viable solution.<br/><br/>Technical description: In this program we will be developing 3.0-3.5 micron-emitting, high-power quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) on metamorphic buffer layer (MBL) substrates. The MBL technology permits the fabrication of lower-strain QCLs to provide a higher-power CW alternative to antimonide or type-II interband lasers, which are inherently performance limited by Auger recombination.  Although QCLs have been demonstrated at 3.5 micron using conventional InP substrates, active-region carrier leakage and high material strain have compromised the performance and reliability of these short wavelength QCLs. Consequently, high-performance QCLs on InP substrates are typically above 4.5 micron in wavelength.  Utilizing unconventional superlattice (SL) material compositions, possible only on MBL substrates, QCLs will be developed with sufficiently deep wells to minimize carrier leakage at these wavelengths and reduced material strain levels to provide performance and reliability advantages over conventional approaches at and below 3.5 micron wavelength. A further benefit of the MBL technology is the transition from InP to GaAs substrates, which will present significant advantages in terms of manufacturing cost and yield.<br/><br/>Key fundamental issues are addressed in the development of strained-engineered SL materials for application to QCLs. The application of SL structure formation on virtual substrates is proposed which greatly expands the compositional space accessible for many device applications and addresses in a transformative way the shortcomings of current QCL technologies. There are no existing high-power single-mode (>0.5W) semiconductor lasers in the 3-3.5 micron wavelength region. It is proposed to develop 3.0-3.5 micron-emitting laser sources with at least an order of magnitude increase in coherent CW output power compared to current state-of-the-art 3.0-3.5 micron semiconductor lasers. Such high-power devices will open up a plethora of new applications from remote sensing of chemicals (methane and other hydrocarbons) to product (plastics) marking. Two novel approaches are proposed to achieve the overall goal i) the implementation of novel step-tapered active-region (STA) quantum-cascade laser (QCL) designs for 3.0-3.5 micron-emitting QCLs, in order to completely suppress carrier leakage (including leakage to indirect valleys in the active region), as well as achieve efficient resonant carrier extraction from lower active region states; thus, obtaining both high T0 and T1 values and low threshold currents; ii) the use of a novel metamorphic-buffer-layer (MBL) approach to bypass the strain-relaxation constraint, thereby allowing growth of QCL structures of the same strain as 4.6-4.8 micron QCLs and thus of relatively low active region thermal resistance and potential for reliable operation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Power distribution grid resiliency is a challenging problem with significant economic and security impacts that has been exacerbated in recent years by the increase in extreme weather events and cyber threats. Recently, networked microgrids have become an emerging paradigm that demonstrates resiliency benefit to their local customers. However, lack of awareness of stability margin, inadequate capability to respond to grid disturbances, and vulnerabilities to communication failure, delay, and cyber-attacks can undermine the capability of networked microgrids to improve distribution grid resiliency. <br/><br/>The research project will create and implement networked microgrids solutions on a novel cyber infrastructure to ensure distribution grid resiliency. This cyber infrastructure is based on Software-Defined Networking. Specifically, the project has three main objectives: (1) To establish a formal analysis method to tractably assess networked microgrid stability; (2) To devise a new concept of microgrid active fault management (AFM) enabled through online distributed optimization; and (3) To build a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based architecture to enable highly resilient networked microgrids. The project will contribute new formal analysis theories for deeper understanding of microgrid stability under high levels of renewable generation. The idea of integrating distributed optimization and power electronic control will pave the way for building grid-friendly networked microgrids, significantly contributing to grid resiliency. The novel SDN-based architecture and techniques will open the door for innovations in devising secure, reliable, and fault-tolerant algorithms for managing resilient networked microgrids and active distribution networks. Overall, the proposed new model-based and data-intensive technologies together will provide scalable, dependable and intelligent solutions to otherwise intractable problems in integrating complex networked microgrids. Building on the team's successes in minority student recruitment and undergraduate education and leveraging existing resources, the education plan targets underrepresented minorities and pre-college students to contribute to the preparation of the next-generation workforce in power engineering.

The next generation spintronics is expected to lead to ultralow power dissipation memory and logic devices that can be integrated with conventional electronics. The projects in this proposal will explore emerging resource for such advances brought about by the special relativistic effects, termed spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in recently discovered topological insulator (TI) materials. The TIs are insulating in their bulk, but also host metallic surfaces with strong SOC. The very recent experiments have demonstrated that when current is injected into heterostructures where TI is attached to a ferromagnetic (FM) layer, magnetization dynamics of the FM layer can be ignited with potentially much less dissipation than in presently available technologies underlying magnetic random access memory. The interface between TI and FM layers with strong SOC and broken inversion symmetry could also generate  swirling spin texture characterized by nano-scale size, topological stability against defects and impurities, and gyro-dynamics analogous to that of a charged particle under magnetic field. Using high performance computing (HPC) simulations to search for optimal combination of TI and FM materials for these phenomena can significantly shorten time needed to produce functional devices.

The proposed research will commence with first principles screening of TI/FM heterostructures in order to identify those with the largest SOC proximity effect onto the magnetic atoms around the interface or interfacial Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction that could give rise to skyrmions at room temperature (all presently known examples of magnetic skyrmions occur below room temperature). In the second stage, SO torque for most promising heterostructures will be computed. The SO torque will be used as an input for the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to study slow dynamics of (classically described) magnetization or skyrmion spin texture in the presence of fast moving (quantum-mechanically described) electrons, including damping and nonequilibrium noise effects generated by them.

Eventually, all major elements of a computer chip (logic, memory, data storage) may be based on magnetism, addressing some of the most pressing current challenges such as power consumption and interconnect delays.  Specifically, spin transfer torque random access memory is being vigorously pursued to replace conventional semiconductor technology in the near future.

As the signal bandwidth is increased, the clock rate required for digital signal processing is also increased, leading to more power consumption and performance degradation. Successfully expanding to millimeter-wave frequencies therefore requires novel radio architectures with alternative solutions for broadband signal processing. To address this issue, the project investigates both linear and nonlinear analog techniques, operating in the millimeter-wave circuit domain, to substantially improve the signal processing of next-generation wireless systems. The resulting analog-assisted architectures will address the needs in areas where high-performance wireless systems are critical, such as communications, internet of things, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare applications. These technologies will be incorporated into the principal investigator's educational goals as modules with focus on experimentation with radios, with topics ranging from system to component level. The principal investigator will partner with established pre-collegiate and pre-engineering programs at the University of Colorado Boulder as a way to engage underrepresented and first-generation college students in engineering.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to systematically investigate the application of analog signal processing and classical control techniques to wideband millimeter-wave (mm-wave) systems employing wide-bandgap device technologies. Fundamental principles of scaling indicate that analog techniques become increasingly attractive in mm-wave systems due to the relatively low fractional bandwidths at high carrier frequencies even when instantaneous bandwidths increase dramatically. Techniques from analog circuit design and classical control theory will therefore be leveraged as a way to compensate for digital-domain bandwidth limitations. An architecture study is proposed to analyze the impact of the digital / radio-frequency (RF) domain boundary on power consumption, complexity, and size when bandwidth and power are prime resources. A specific focus will be the nonlinear analysis of load-modulated power amplifiers as a targeted driver of this digital / RF interface design in efficiency-enhanced transmitters. Realizing analog-assisted architectures will, in turn, require novel supporting circuits at the component level. To this end, the research will develop analog and mixed-mode circuits in GaN technology, leveraging its high transconductance and transition frequency. Proposed techniques include integrated low-frequency control paths for, e.g., bias-based gain correction, and developing fundamental building blocks for signal generation and control. To validate the design methodologies developed in this work, the demonstration of these technologies will be a novel wideband transceiver with built-in linearity correction. Through this research project, the performance of linear and efficient wideband mm-wave systems will be substantially improved, enabling new and innovative uses of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such applications include coordinated unmanned aerial vehicles that operate in variable atmospheric conditions, concepts for relocatable marine hydrokinetic energy systems that operate in a varying ocean environment, and airborne wind energy systems that operate in an atmospheric environment where the wind varies with respect to both time and vertical position. This research will focus on deriving general theory that will be relevant to a variety of applications, along with the validation of these results on an airborne wind energy system. In airborne wind energy systems, the conventional tower is replaced by tethers and a lifting body (a wing or aerostat) that elevates a horizontal-axis turbine to high altitudes. Because the tether lengths can be adjusted, the operating altitude can be varied to optimally harness the wind resource.

While optimal control in a temporally varying environment is a well-studied problem that can be addressed through Markov models, the addition of a spatial component results in an explosion in the number of states, rendering Markov-based methods computationally infeasible in most cases. Furthermore, the presence of partial observability results in a fundamental tradeoff between exploration (obtaining knowledge of the spatial environment) and exploitation (operating at the most favorable locations). To address the complexities of this spatiotemporal optimization problem, this research will explore the use of a multi-rate, multi-scale hierarchical framework.

The proposal is separated into three aims: 1) develop calcium sensors and optogenetic channels active on different wavelength ranges to allow simultaneous readout and control, 2) develop a dual-beam two photon microscope, and 3) develop imaging software that can process neural activity in real-time. <br/><br/>Nontechnical  abstract<br/>Understanding neural function requires examining specific subsets of the vast numbers of neurons in the brain. Recently developed optogenetics tools, such as optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging, have partially fulfilled the need to target these specific sets of neurons and study their function. These techniques deliver engineered genes to targeted neural populations, and use light to manipulate or measure neural activity. Current optogenetic tools lack the spatiotemporal resolution to causally study many individual neurons in parallel on fast time scales; they only make broad conclusions either on near-millimeter sized brain regions, or over the timescale of many action potentials. We propose to integrate the design and implementation of optical and genetic tools to greatly refine the scale of investigating neural activity. Specifically, we will create two optically independent channels: one channel for fast, spatially precise optical patterning to control individual neurons; and one channel for independent recording of neural activity from individual neurons. We will then integrate these two channels by creating software that instantaneously patterns optical excitation based on the optical recording. Integrative design and engineering of this expansive set of tools will enable neuroscientists to quickly manipulate and control large populations of single neurons, a capability that does not exist presently. Our technology will allow the community to directly explore how neural activity patterns of many individual neurons in one brain region drive downstream neural activity. This novel probing of functional connectivity is exactly the type of study needed to better understand the coordination of neural activity in healthy and diseased brains. Beyond the specific application of neuroscience, training students within our multidisciplinary setting will create the next generation of scientists capable of tackling the broad set of technical challenges facing society today. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Optical imaging of brain activity has steadily developed into a staple technique within neuroscience labs over the past decade. In combination with genetically encoded sensors of neural activity, optical methods enable genetic targeting and chronic, simultaneous imaging of many individual neurons. One significant weakness of existing optical techniques when compared to electrophysiology is the inability to simultaneously measure and control the activity of a neuron in real time. We propose to address this shortcoming by developing an optical imaging system and data processing software suite that will enable real-time optical readout of neural activity and real-time neural feedback via optical excitation, all with cellular level specificity and in parallel over a large population of neurons. This new ability to optically record and manipulate many genetically or functionally specified neurons individually will augment current studies using bulk neural activation or inhibition; the fine scale perturbations of neurons will tease apart the details of neural circuits. Specifically, we will engineer a set of optogenetic actuators, fluorescent sensors, and microscopy tools that will enable optical readout and control of neurons in different wavelength channels. We will also develop fast image processing algorithms that quickly convert images to neural activity of individual neurons, thereby enabling real-time control of neural activity based on the optical readout. Recently, improvements to these tools occurred independently. Our proposal will address the integrated development of the tool set, and effectively employ trade-offs between the individual components. For example, simultaneous engineering of the protein sensor, imaging processing software, and optical imaging hardware will optimize the readout fidelity. Similarly, joint design of the genetic tools? spectral separation and the optical spatiotemporal resolution will extend optical control precision. Integration of these developments to examine neural function at the cellular level is unprecedented: successful advancement of this research will enable novel examination of the brain and help guide targeted biomedical therapies."

This project proposes an energy-efficient cognitive radio system that addresses its many practical challenges including a low-power wideband radio that operates in multiple frequency bands and a means to seamlessly and efficiently coordinate the operating bands between communicating unlicensed users. The proposed work presents a complete integrated solution, ranging from radio implementation, signal processing algorithm development, and network connectivity. These different layers of abstraction have been jointly optimized to enable a low-power and robust cognitive radio system.<br/><br/>The proposed energy-efficient cognitive radio (CR) system, which is jointly optimized at the circuit, signal processing, and network layers, operates as follows: 1) A secondary user (SU) employs a novel compressed sampling receiver based on polyphase sequences implemented via mixer harmonics to sense concurrently the entire frequency span of interest. 2) Since the communicating band between SUs is unknown, data is transmitted by sending the same signal at low power levels across the entire frequency span of interest while nulling energy in the primary user (PU) bands. A novel sub-Nyquist transmitter, which can be viewed as a dual of the compressed sensing receiver, is proposed for this purpose. 3) The receiving SU uses the same compressed sampling receiver for sensing PUs to receive the SU signals. This is achieved by projecting the received signals to PU's null space, whose frequency locations were estimated during sensing. By appropriately selecting the basis functions set in the analog front-end, most of the received energy can be added coherently. 4) As SU energy is spread across the entire frequency span of interest, the resulting channel impulse response (CIR) is richly scattered. The CIR itself, therefore, can be used as users' signatures for achieving multiple-access communications. Furthermore, by leveraging on techniques from multiuser detection theory, high spectral efficiency can be achieved."

Since bandwidth is a scarce resource, spectrum sensing, i.e., the identification of unused frequencies in order to opportunistically re-use these resources, will be a critical component of future wireless systems. While modern wireless systems already rely on antenna arrays to improve spectral efficiency by re-using frequencies at different locations in space, only little attention has been given to sensing and re-using unused spectrum in space. This project builds upon recent advances in low-power wideband transceiver design, wideband compressive sensing, and multi-antenna wireless communication in order to perform SPAtio-Spectral Sensing (SPASS). SPASS enables the identification of unused resources in both frequency and space, which can be used to optimize the spectral- and energy-efficiency of wireless systems. This project pursues a vertically-integrated research approach spanning circuit design, theory and algorithms, and system design in order to demonstrate the efficacy and limits of SPASS. Broader impacts resulting from this work include an extensive outreach plan involving undergraduate students from Latin America in this research and increasing participation of female high-school students with Cornell's CURIE Academy.<br/><br/>Multi-antenna spectrum sensing via NonUniform Wavelet Sampling (NUWS), a recently introduced sampling paradigm specifically designed for RF feature extraction, is the core concept of this project.

These features are then used to identify unused resources in both frequency and space by means of specialized white-space detection algorithms. The project focuses on a holistic and practical approach to realizing a full and usable SPASS system; this is done by fusing the design of algorithms with the design of mixed-signal circuits for multi-antenna NUWS that extract wideband spectral features with high sensitivity directly from RF signals in an energy-efficient manner. To identify unused resources, white-space detection algorithms that exploit the sparse and low-rank structure of spectral activity in both frequency and space will be developed. The circuit prototypes and algorithms will be used to perform real-world RF measurements, which enable (i) a fundamental analysis of the system-level tradeoffs of NUWS-based SPASS and (ii) an investigation of the unused resources in realistic IoT communication scenarios that reveal the potential of reorganizing the RF spectrum in frequency and space.

The existing network technologies that support the current wireless data demand are expected to increase their capacity significantly in the next decade, calling for spectrum and energy efficient communication strategies. There are two popular approaches to efficiently utilize the RF spectrum: One is the cognitive radio networks which allow mobile users to share the spectrum that has been primarily allocated to other services such as television broadcasting, global position system (GPS), radar, weather forecasting, etc., provided that the mobile users impose limited interference to existing services. Another approach is to enhance the mobile broadband networks via expanded bandwidth, massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, and densified heterogeneous networks (HetNets). However, both approaches have limitations and have different impacts on spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. In addition, current hardware platforms exhibit formidable challenges in supporting high computational complexity and low power consumption. This project introduces a novel network architecture and its application-specific hardware optimization using neuromorphic computing devices. The new wireless network architecture allows mobile users to perform spatio-temporal spectrum sensing and actively search for dynamic spectrum access (DSA) opportunities to enable short-range and local communications. Meanwhile, neuromorphic computing devices that mimic bio-neurological processes will be designed to tackle the high computational complexity of the new dynamic spectrum access approach with extremely low power consumption.

Two independent research advances in nanophotonics were recently pioneered which, when combined, are ideally suited to address this goal.  They are: (1) the demonstration of optically active nanoantenna-diodes, where carriers are generated by the decay of photoexcited surface plasmons in resonant metallic nanoantennas, then injected into the conduction band of the adjacent semiconductor, and (2) the development of infrared nanoantennas tuned to the resonant vibration frequencies of specific chemical functional groups.  By merging these two concepts, narrowband, infrared active nanoantenna-diodes for the spectroscopic identification of small molecules with direct electrical readout will be created.  Efforts will focus on the development of nanoantenna-diodes with enhanced responsivities and quantum efficiencies, through the implementation of gain, and on lineshape control of the nanoantenna-diode spectral response, to ultimately resolve molecular spectral lines in the near-infrared region of the spectrum.  This approach would ultimately eliminate the need for near-infrared photodetectors based on costly materials, along with the bulky dispersive optics and large optical path lengths required in conventional infrared spectroscopy for wavelength discrimination."

Similar to graphene, the most widely studied two-dimensional material, transition metal dichalcogenides represent a larger class of layered materials with varying electronic properties, from semiconducting to superconducting. The diverse set of electronic properties in these materials makes them suitable for applications ranging from transistors to chemical sensors or photodetectors. Key to an understanding of their fundamental electronic properties is the role of the disorder potential, interfaces, and edges in individual layers, and of the band and rotational alignment in heterostructures.  Specifically, the proposed effort will (1) measure band-alignment in transition metal dichalcogenide based heterostructures, (2) realize heterostructures of two-dimensional materials with controlled rotational alignment, (3) explore the impact of rotational alignment on the electronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures, and using these ingredients (4) design and fabricate novel heterostructure tunneling devices.  This program builds on the PIs existing collaborative research and recent preliminary data on the fabrication and characterization of these heterostructures.

Research in photonics molecules seeks to use optically coupled photonic resonant microstructures to implement functions and behaviors with photons that are analogous to electronic atomic and molecular systems. Optical resonators can be thought of as photonic atoms and collections of photonic resonators can be designed to act like photonic molecules, enabling wide classes of new functions, systems and applications. The research outcome is expected to transform the field of photonic molecule technology by enabling new device functions that can be implemented using large-scale optical resonator arrays compatible with wafer-scale foundry integration.  The ability to engineer molecular behavior based on photons has the potential to impact a wide variety of applications and revolutionize the performance, power, size and scaling of circuits difficult to realize with traditional electronics. <br/>The proposed work combines photonic molecule techniques with a silicon nitride based integrated low-loss optical waveguide technology to demonstrate two transformative functions, a non-magnetic optical isolator and a fast acquisition high quality factor photonic circuit for real-time low-jitter frequency and phase recovery. These functions have proved to be difficult to realize with current integrated photonic technologies. Optical isolators and real-time frequency and phase recovery are both device functions that will impact the development of integrated optical digital and analog circuits and a wide variety of applications. New device simulation and design tools, layout tools, fabrication methods and testing methodologies will be developed. Broader impact of the proposed technology is the potential to decrease size, weight, cost and power of high-speed data communications technologies, special purpose hardware simulations of complex problems out of reach of today's computers include many body physics, economic and transportation modeling, and medical solutions for biological sampling and disease detection.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>In this exploratory research, the PI proposes to study the design and fabrication of photonic molecules utilizing large arrays of optical resonators, ranging from micrometer to millimeters sizes, implemented in ultra-low loss silicon nitride wafer-scale integration technology.

These functions have proved to be difficult to realize with other device technologies. The approach to non-magnetic optical isolation utilizes discrete coupled-ring resonators whose refractive indices are modulated with a constant phase offset such that temporal spatial modulation imposes an effective angular moment and breaks optical reciprocity. Fast optical signal acquisition with high Q requires overcoming the time bandwidth product limits of passive resonators by implementing optical isolation between coupled low-Q resonators and high-Q resonators. The resonators will be designed and fabricated using deep etched coupled silicon nitride rings controlled with low power piezo electric tuning in a wafer-scale integration platform. The methods used will incorporate detailed numerical simulations, device design and layout techniques, advanced fabrication of low loss optical waveguide coupled resonator arrays and programming interconnects.

Due to the small size of millimeter-wave antennas and electronics combined with the ability of millimeter-wave propagation through fog, smoke, clothing, and some building materials, millimeter-wave sensors are becoming critically important tools in areas such as security sensing, medical imaging, autonomous vehicle sensing, and scientific research. Millimeter-wave imaging furthermore enables imaging and sensing in an electromagnetic regime that is presently underutilized, and is thus becoming increasingly important in the areas stated above. Antenna arrays in particular are becoming of greater interest due to their smaller size and greater flexibility than mechanically-scanned millimeter-wave imagers. This project will develop a new method of millimeter-wave array imaging called active incoherent imaging. The proposed incoherent imaging approach has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of millimeter-wave and sub-millimeter-wave imaging without sacrificing image resolution. Furthermore, the image quality of the proposed approach does not degrade significantly even if part of the receiver array elements fail, which improves its long-term utility over pixel-based imaging methods. The results of this project will enable millimeter-wave imagers to become more accessible to society and to be easily implemented in a broad range of applications. Furthermore, the results of this research will be used to enhance existing courses and develop new courses in radar and millimeter-wave technology at Michigan State University. <br/><br/>Combining aspects of sparse array theory and spatial frequency sampling, the proposed active incoherent millimeter-wave imaging utilizes a spatio-temporal incoherent transmitter array combined with a sparse, coherent receiver array. While resolution is the primary limiting factor in millimeter-wave imaging in many applications, sparse receiver arrays using spatial frequency sampling can be utilized to generate images with resolution equivalent to a fully filled array with at least an order of magnitude fewer elements. Incoherent imaging has the additional benefit of improved efficiency because fewer receiver elements are needed and incoherent transmitter arrays are more energy efficient to implement than coherent transmitter arrays. This project will also investigate a novel modular packaging format, where individual transceiver chips are wirelessly phase locked and the received data is wirelessly downlinked. This distributed approach enables the new imaging method to be directly scalable and easily implemented in future millimeter-wave imaging systems."

These kinds of problems arise in a broad range of applications in engineering systems. Despite the substantial literature on convex and non-convex quadratic programming (general classes of optimization problems), most available optimization techniques are either not scalable or work efficiently only for convex quadratic programming and do not provide adequate results for non-convex quadratic programming. This project focuses on fundamental research on an integrated approach which the research team expects will lead to powerful solution methods for classes of non-convex programming problems. The new approach will be applicable for non-convex problems arising in many areas, such as power and energy systems, transportation, and communications. The project will involve students from underrepresented groups and will positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The general difficulty of power and energy optimization problems has a direct impact on power and energy systems management. This is one of the most fundamental concerns that must be dealt with in electrical power system management. The primary objective of this project is to address the difficulty associated with problem non-convexity by developing high-performance optimization techniques that apply to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems, particularly the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. There is a critical and urgent need for developing smart and robust OPF solvers. The conventional options currently available for DC-OPF are quite limited. The research will fundamentally address AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) with active and reactive quadratically constrained quadratic programming optimization problems of a form that arises in operation and planning applications of the power system. Besides being non-convex, these problems are identified to be NP-hard. The proposed solution method is based on several basic and powerful optimization techniques in convex optimization theory such as linearized approximation techniques, linear and global search procedures, bi-linear and convex relaxation, and alternate direction methods. Also, new schemes and theories must be introduced to establish the convergence of the algorithm and guarantee the global optimality of the solution results. The research team devised a new successive linear optimization based branch and bound (SLOBB) method based on deploying principles of the classical linear approximation, improved convex relaxation, and the branch-and-bound technique to find the global optimal solution of the AC-OPF problem. Since the linear programming and convex solvers are robust and fast, and also the power systems community is already familiar with linear and convex programs for OPF, the algorithm that will be developed will be beneficial and user-friendly for the AC-OPF problem. We will also pursue theoretical investigations to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm and analyze its efficiency on existing test bed systems and synthetic data sets. The developed models and methodologies will be executed in real-world practical power grids."

One shot controls include disconnection of generation and load and fast power changes on HVDC transmission lines.  The control actions used in this work generally reduce inter-area power flows which tends to improve transient and steady state stability. The reduction of power flows is also associated with the prevention of relays from tripping on overload. Many blackouts result from cascading outages involving generators and transmission lines tripping off-line due to protective relaying. The proposed controls promise to make these failure modes less likely to occur.  In addition to one shot control at the transmission level, the investigators will also develop algorithms to enable consumer appliances such as AC units to detect the loss of a large generator nearby and turn off long enough for the Independent System Operator (ISO) to take corrective action at the transmission level.  The proposed methods are inexpensive and easy to incorporate into smart devices because only local measurements are used. No remote communication is required.  Utilities could provide rebates or rate discounts to motivate customers to purchase appliances that use the proposed control schemes.  All the methods developed in this work from one shot controls at the transmission level to smart appliances that operate autonomously will contribute to a more resilient and self-healing electric grid.  <br/>     <br/><br/>Many state variables in turbine governors, voltage regulators and other digital controllers are subject to maximum and minimum limits. The differential algebraic equations used for analytical solution of power system dynamics are only valid if controller variables do not hit their limiting values. This is one reason why accurate prediction of power system behavior requires detailed time domain simulation. Deriving control strategies from a large number of simulations is a big data problem that requires pattern recognition. The proposed controls are response based which means, for example, they do not receive information about the status of particular breakers. Current industry practices focus on event based risk assessment (e.g. Special Protection Scheme) assuming the operators are fully aware of what has happened in the grid. It is challenging to develop response based controls that are actuated quickly enough to stabilize some events.  This research will use event detection and pattern recognition prediction to actuate response based control earlier so that the stabilizing effect is greater. Another area of this research will contribute to self healing for a smarter grid. The underlying scientific principle is that local modes of oscillation have higher frequencies than inter-area modes. The derivative engineering contribution of the work will show how a Fourier calculation can help detect nearby loss of generation events using only local frequency measurements. The proposed methods are novel compared to existing proposals in the literature for under frequency load shedding. Utilities are not currently benefitting from autonomous load shedding at the residential level as proposed here."

The goal of this project is to establish the theoretical foundations as well as the development procedures for novel extremely low-cost waveform design and processing frameworks that address the fundamental requirements of future radar systems - all in the pursuit of enhanced adaptivity, agility, and reliability. The project investigates radar waveform design and processing problems of interest through different theoretical lenses. At the same time, it translates the theoretical outcomes into more practical domains of vehicular technology and spectrum sharing.  The project is thus expected to have a significant impact on the theory and practice of radar, and is of direct relevance to national and global needs. For instance, the project contributes to national defense and security efforts: in radar applications, the task of target detection/estimation relies on inference based on the collected data. The power of reliable probing waveform design and inference in a short period of time determines the level of confidence and agility we have in target determination, and as a result plays a key role in the ability of defense command or leadership to make confident and effective decisions. The project involves preparing students for engineering in the 21st century through the incorporation of practical design and problem-solving techniques into the education curriculum. <br/><br/>Waveform design and processing for radar has a crucial role in fulfilling the promises of adaptivity, agility, and reliability: the radar performance is shown to be considerably improved by a judicious design of the probing signals and processing schemes. The arising design problems may deal with various measures of quality (including detection, estimation, and information-theoretic criteria), and moreover, the practical condition that the employed signals must belong to a limited signal set. Such diversity of design metrics and signal constraints lays the foundation for many interesting research works in waveform optimization. Additionally, waveform design and processing for next-generation radars is a topic of great interest due to the recent growing demands in increasing the number of antennas/sensors in various radar applications (thus requiring an increased agility in design and processing stages). In contrast, our current approaches are not fully adequate in handling design metrics and practical signal constraints in an agile and reliable manner.  In light of such recent technological advances, the proposed work seeks to overcome the limitations of the traditional methods by studying and developing novel extremely low-cost waveform design and processing frameworks that address the emerging requirements of modern radar practice. The proposed research spans waveform design and processing problems: (i) with signal constraints that typically make the problems intractable, (ii) for robustness with a focus on system impairments and worst-case scenarios, as well as (iii) for co-existence which is deemed to be a key component in enhanced access to radio spectrum for both radar and communication users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reinforcement learning algorithms are not yet mature enough to guarantee performance when applied to control of CPS. In light of these limitations, this project aims to lay the theoretical and computational foundation to certify reinforcement learning algorithms so that they may be deployed in society with high confidence.<br/><br/>This project will certify reinforcement learning algorithms that compute optimal control policies in systems with non-classical dynamics and non-classical costs. To achieve this goal, we will generalize convergent algorithms originally designed for purely continuous systems to apply in hybrid control systems whose states undergo a mixture of discrete and continuous transitions. Moreover, we specifically aim to ensure this approach is applicable to societal-scale CPS in which multiple agents, some of which may be humans, interact directly with the CPS. These algorithms will be experimentally validated on three testbeds that represent a range of hybrid and multi-agent phenomena that arise in CPS. The first testbed will test the performance of our algorithms on societal-scale traffic flow networks via simulation. The second testbed will consider heterogeneous teams of aerial and terrestrial mobile robots collaborating with human partners to perform construction, inspection, and maintenance tasks on scale facsimiles of infrastructure like bridges, and tunnels.

In the last few decades, with the aggressive scaling of electronic devices, we have realized unprecedented performance in computing and communication. However, this rapid scaling, commonly known as ""Moore's Law"" is slowing and it is well-understood that next-generation computing technology will rely heavily on data centers and cloud computing. We are already experiencing this trend with the increased investment from large technology companies in these sectors. To support this architecture, however, we need to bring optical interconnect technology, which is the backbone of the modern internet, to shorter length scales. These optical devices need to operate at extremely low power. Going beyond traditional computing and communication, quantum technology presents a paradigm shift in the way we think about information technology. Extremely low-power optical devices can also provide solutions for these quantum technologies. In our research, we will develop photonic integrated circuits, similar to electronic integrated circuits, integrated with single atom thick 2D materials to create these low-power optical devices. Specifically, we will be using atomic defects in 2D materials to push the energy to the single photon level, which is the lowest conceivable energy in photonics, and almost a million times smaller compared to energy consumption in existing optical devices. Our work will bring the innovations in atomic physics to chip-scale technology, and with 2D materials, it is possible to develop these low power devices in a silicon platform exploiting the same fabrication technology which is used to manufacture today's computers and smart phones.<br/><br/>Classical and quantum signal processing using light has been a long-standing goal for scientists and engineers. Recent progress in micro- and nano-scale optical devices has renewed interest in this subject, as it can allow pushing energy consumption to regimes that have not been attainable in bulk optical systems. Specifically, by exploiting nanoscale optical cavities and single quantum emitters, the potential exists for building photonic devices based on principles of quantum electrodynamics. However, in all the existing cavity quantum electrodynamic devices, the single emitters are embedded in a 3D-substrate, rendering external control and facial integration with existing electronic and photonic platforms difficult. These limitations can be circumvented by using a quantum emitter in a 2D substrate, such as single emitters in monolayer materials like transition metal dichalcogenides. The unprecedented material compatibility of monolayer materials will also allow building these quantum optical devices using scalable CMOS technologies. The current proposal aims to research and develop a solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamic platform with single quantum emitters embedded in monolayer materials coupled to integrated solid-state nano-scale cavities. Combining numerical simulation, device fabrication, and optical characterization, the research thrusts include: (i) measure Purcell enhancement with a tunable 2D emitter-cavity system; (ii) demonstrate cavity-enhanced light emitting diodes and (iii) observe strong coupling cavity quantum electrodynamic effects. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate electronically tunable strongly coupled emitter-cavity system, where electro-optic and all-optical switching can be performed at a single photon energy level, and non-classical light can be generated exploiting strong correlation between photons."

Several Independent System Operators (ISOs) in the United States have adopted CBs with the general assumption that CBs would enhance market efficiency by lowering the gap between the prices in the day-ahead market (DAM) and prices in the real-time market (RTM). However, analysis of ISO market data over the past few years has led to a current state of uncertainty and debate about the true advantages or disadvantages of CBs in electricity markets and their impact on utility customers and generation firms. What is alarming is the reason behind having such debates: there is currently no clear scientific understanding of how CBs work (or don't work) in wholesale electricity markets. However, the PI's preliminary studies have shown that some of the concerns that are recently raised by ISOs about CBs are fundamental and have root causes that can be understood through mathematical analysis and illustrative examples. In brief, many of these issues are due to the physics of transmission lines, generators, and loads, which do not allow application of the generally accepted principles of market efficiency as observed in trading in other financial and commodity marketplaces. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit in this proposal is to provide scientific fundamentals, in the form of mathematical analysis and illustrative examples and case studies, which can help to ultimately resolve the current state of uncertainty and debate on the subject of CBs in ISO markets.

Floyd, Jacob J. Adams, and Brian L. Hughes<br/>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering<br/>North Carolina State University<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  Research on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications has shown that using multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver can dramatically improve the capacity of wireless multipath channels.  Since many wireless devices are limited in size, using multiple antennas requires close spacing which leads to strong, frequency-dependent coupling between antennas. Coupling can profoundly reduce received power, diversity and capacity. Prior work suggests that impedance matching at the receiver can reclaim most of the lost system capacity; however, these matching networks can be complex and difficult to implement, and they must adapt to changing channel and antenna conditions. Finally, existing antennas for MIMO systems are designed in an ad hoc manner, with no consideration given to finding methods to fully capture all available degrees of freedom and maximize the capacity of the aperture. The goal of this project is to combine information theory, antenna engineering, and radio-frequency (RF) circuit design to enable new approaches to realize compact broadband multi-antenna receivers. The overall approach is to develop multi-mode antennas, reconfigurable receivers, and communication algorithms that act in concert to maximize capacity of the underlying channel.  Specifically, a systematic method will be developed to design MIMO antennas based on information-theoretic metrics, such as capacity, by controlling and shaping mutual coupling of the eigenmodes.  Novel MIMO receivers will also be developed that employ reconfigurable baseband impedance matching networks which are frequency translated to RF using passive mixer-first architectures.  Finally, communication and signal processing algorithms will be developed that can efficiently sense and adjust the matching networks in response to changing channel conditions.  To evaluate these new technologies, a hardware test-bed will be constructed consisting of a two-port adaptive MIMO receiver, two-port compact antenna, and a digital interface for control and signal processing.  Ultimately, the scaling of performance and complexity will be explored as the techniques are extended to larger multi-port systems.<br/>Broader Impacts:  This multi-disciplinary project provides a holistic view of MIMO receiver design and develops new models, antenna design methods, communications algorithms and matching techniques which could significantly increase the capacity and performance of future cellular and wireless local area networks.  If successful, this project would enable MIMO techniques to be employed even in physically small receivers with strong antenna mutual coupling, allowing increased data rates, larger range, and/or longer battery lives.

Developing practical methods to mitigate interference is critical for the future of wireless technology. The proposed research addresses the problem of interference, and therefore has a large potential impact on economic growth as well as quality of life. This project has two interconnected components. First, based on recent information theory results, communication streams will be decomposed into many small streams; these can be managed, combined, and split to combat interference. Second, adaptive liquid-metal antennas will be investigated for interference mitigation. As liquid metals can be made to change their physical shape, they can enable antennas that can be adjusted to reduce interference. Research and education for this project will be tightly integrated through Vertically Integrated Projects that involve students ranging from PhD students to sophomore-level undergraduates, including under-represented minority and female students. The results of this research will be disseminated widely through the web, technical conferences, and seminars. <br/><br/>Exciting discoveries in recent years have pushed the boundaries of understanding interference. The theoretical capacity of interference channels in several operating modes has been established, and new theoretical techniques such as interference alignment have been discovered. However, many practical challenges stand in the way of realizing these promising techniques. This project has two interconnected components for developing interference-mitigation techniques for wireless networks that create a new direction in interference mitigation aimed at practicality and wide applicability. The first component of the project decomposes the communication stream into ""microstreams"" to fit the transmissions into the contours of available opportunities, in a manner that improves rates while limiting the damage of interference. The broad principle of breaking communication into many small pieces has a long and distinguished pedigree, including ARQ in the data link layer and TCP/IP in higher layers. The proposed research introduces a novel manifestation of this time-tested principle to produce new approaches that combat interference in the physical layer. The second component of the project investigates adaptive liquid-metal antennas that generate radiation patterns to avoid interference in a manner not possible with signal processing alone; in particular their unique flexibility helps to avoid ""singular"" values of channel gains that prevent interference mitigation. The unique strengths of liquid-metal antennas are perfectly showcased in this application, because the exact manner of microstream combining can have a strong effect on performance, and this is where liquid-metal antennas promise to have a strong impact. The proposed activity will play an important role in the advancement of knowledge and understanding in the field of wireless interference. The project will develop practical methods for coding and decoding under interference. Furthermore, it will lead to a basic understanding of how liquid-metal antennas can affect capacity in interference networks."

Enabling energy-efficient wireless communication, therefore, is the most critical issue to prolong the lifespan of ultra-low power (ULP) IoT devices and eventually realize perpetual operation only powered by harvested ambient energy. This program presents innovative ""back-channel"" communication techniques for ultra-low power devices, which could not afford standard WiFi or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) based wireless communication due to their extremely limited power budget.  The concept of back-channel communication will make it possible to interconnect heterogeneous ULP IoT devices through existing WiFi or BLE networks even if these ULP IoT devices are incapable of decoding regular WiFi or BLE messages. In addition, WiFi and BLE standard compliant nodes will benefit from the back-channel technique to significantly enhance their power efficiency without employing a proprietary wakeup signal transmitter and/or dedicated channel resources. Novel concepts such as WiFi-on-demand, replacing conventional always-on WiFi Access Points, can be realized by the outcomes of the proposed research. The results of this program will be disseminated in the form of Web applications and software packages so that students, researchers and industry experts can explore other applications utilizing the concept of back-channel communication embedded in ubiquitous WiFi and/or BLE standard packets. The proposed research could make direct impact on the next wireless standardization to adopt more flexible packet structures to enrich use-cases of back-channel communication.<br/><br/>The proposed back-channel signaling embedded in WiFi and BLE messages has unique properties that are easily detectable by ULP receivers consuming only 10s of micro-Watts or even less. The proposed scheme eliminates the need for specialized transmitter hardware or dedicated channel resources for embedded back-channel signal transmission. Instead, carefully sequenced data bit streams will generate back-channel messages from already-deployed WiFi and BLE infrastructure without any hardware modification. This WiFi and BLE back-channel communication is feasible in various modulation formats that are easily decodable by non-WiFi / non-BLE IoT devices. This research program will demonstrate multiple types of ULP back-channel receiver integrated circuits (ICs) that include the RF and analog frontend as well as the baseband signal processing. A complete ULP wakeup scheme will be demonstrated with fabricated back-channel receiver ICs interacting with commercial off-the-shelf WiFi and BLE devices. The IC design goal is to achieve 1/1000x lower power consumption than a commercial low-power WiFi receiver and 1/200x lower power than a commercial Bluetooth receiver. A generalized back-channel communication framework will be proposed to expand the back-channel use cases beyond WiFi and BLE standards."

Indeed, current congestion mitigation methods, such as speed harmonization that uses a sequence of variable speed limits along a highway do not reliably control congestion, and may exacerbate it (e.g., via shocks propagated through speed limit changes) due to the inconsistency between congestion prediction and real-time control. The objective of this project is to develop a holistic approach using machine-learning methods to identify and predict macroscopic congestion behavior of traffic based on both vehicle-borne and transportation infrastructure measurements, while designing fine-grain control systems for individual vehicles that can help to mitigate congestion effects.  In doing so, the project recognizes that these designs must account for the possibility of low take-up rates of connected, automated vehicles (CAVs) over the next decade, and the consequent dominance of human-mediated vehicle operation for some time to come.  The project also includes the development of educational materials on data analytics and vehicular control systems. Intrinsic to the program are efforts at outreach to involve high-school students via demonstrations and lectures based on the technology developed.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop the theory of and evaluate a novel approach to traffic management entitled ""real-time learning-mediated control"".  The key idea is to meld large-scale real-time learning about macroscopic phenomena in a physically interpretable manner, with distributed dynamic control of individual vehicles in a provably safe and efficient manner. The work comprises two thrusts, namely (i) Traffic State Prediction, which offers a Graph Signal Processing (GSP)-based congestion prediction approach for planned and unplanned congestion-causing events, and (ii) Traffic Shaping and Control, which offers novel vehicular control methods that shape traffic in a stable manner over the multiple dimensions of target time headway and velocities over space and time, and candidate time-gap and velocity profiles in a mixed environment of both connected, automated vehicles and human driven ones.  Thus, the overall aim is to combine the ability of learning methods to provide predictions about complex interconnected systems, with control laws that are safe and consistent with the laws of physics.   The value of this research to broader society is in combining traffic prediction, control and learning, which can result in accurate congestion mitigation and increased throughput.   Incorporating analytical concepts into senior design projects and courses enhances the project via educational impact. The project also contributes to development of systems-design expertise for students, as well as to diversity enhancement through minority student engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal aims at the development of novel theory and hardware that will significantly improve the ability to reuse the crowded spectrum by leveraging the capabilities of full-duplex mobile users in sensing the spectrum while they are transmitting. The concept of a fully passive full-duplex radio front-end in this proposed research is a fundamental shift from the conventional full-duplex radio designs that shall provide significant power and complexity advantages. The use of the proposed design in cognitive networks to intelligently detect unused radio spectrum is expected to lead to more efficient use of the spectrum and significant capacity enhancement that is not easily achievable using existing technologies. In the long term, the proposed concept has the transformative potential to improve wireless systems in a variety of aspects, ranging from high-capacity distributed multiple-input multiple-output solutions, efficient network protocols to support intelligent interference coordination, and management to reduce latency in multi-hop wireless networks. Besides these societal and technical contributions, this project will also advance discovery and understanding via integrating with both graduate and undergraduate education, and enhance infrastructure for research and education via an interdisciplinary, inter-institutional collaboration. The education and collaboration plans will additionally broaden the participation of underrepresented groups, including those from a predominantly undergraduate institution and female students. <br/><br/>Through a collaboration between two experts in different areas (i.e., antenna design and communication theory), the overall objective of the proposed interdisciplinary research project is to develop new architectures and algorithms for full-duplex cognitive radio wireless communications to significantly improve reuse of the crowded spectrum. The specific aims of the project include the following: 1) to design and develop fully passive full-duplex hardware architectures suited for cognitive mobile devices, which significantly cancel the self-interference without the need for adaptive analog cancellation at the 5 Ghz band or below; 2) to investigate the applications of the proposed full-duplex hardware architectures in enhancing white spectrum usage and increasing capacity of cognitive radio links under the context of opportunistic spectrum access; and 3) to investigate the applications of the proposed full-duplex hardware architectures in multiuser cognitive networks for further sensing performance improvement and capacity enhancement. For Aim 1, the merit of the approach is in the use of novel antenna configurations that provide a considerable amount of isolation from self-interference. The design is based on obtaining two identical out-of-phase components of self-interference signals. The design is fully passive and can be used in wideband applications. For Aims 2 and 3, the approach to the information-theoretical characterization of the full-duplex cognitive radio link and network is founded on capacity calculation techniques using novel results in real and complex analysis, probability theory, and optimization theory. The full-duplex capability will be exploited in both simultaneously transmitting/sensing mode and simultaneously transmitting/receiving mode to fundamentally enhance the efficiency of using the vacant spectrum and to significantly improve the capacity of cognitive radio systems."

For instance, in many settings robots operate in closed-off environments in manufacturing.  However, as these systems are deployed in increasingly isolated environments (such as search and rescue efforts, automation in surgical devices, collaborative manufacturing) these robots will need to operate while reasoning about substantial uncertainty.  Moreover, actions taken by the system impact that uncertainty.  The proposed work will develop algorithms that enable a cyber-physical system to reason about what actions it must take to manage its uncertainty.  A simple example of this is understanding that one must look behind and under things when searching for an object. The goal of this project is to automate the process of managing that uncertainty, however it arises.  For instance, interacting with humans (such as physically interacting with a person while assisting her motion, or tracking a person during a search effort) involves uncertainty about what the person is going to do.  Enabling a robotic system to actively test a person's intent, and then act according to her subsequent behavior, is key to the robot's ability to be an effective partner.  This essential point, that action on the part of a cyber-physical system can be used to explicitly manage its understanding of the world, is the core purpose of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The proposed work will leverage recent results in information-based real-time nonlinear control. Specifically, ergodic control (controlling the ergodicity of a trajectory relative to some reference distribution) enables one to specify an objective using a density function to describe the desired spatial characteristics for a trajectory. In the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), this allows a system to actively probe multiple states, simultaneously considering process uncertainty, measurement uncertainty, and uncertainty associated with the Markov process itself, even when the HMM is changing over time because of new states or processes being introduced into the ambient environment. The apparent reason for the effectiveness of ergodic control in the context of reactive planning under uncertainty is that it always computes plans in the continuum, avoiding the combinatoric complexity associated with POMDPs. Moreover, the needs of the dynamic system and the cyber system are inter-related during physical motion, so the work will additionally develop methods that maintain stability with respect to both state and information. This inter-dependence creates a trade-off between the physical ability to act and the computational load on the cyber system, enabling a cyber-physical system to reduce the load on its cyber system through physical action.  The research will develop algorithms capable of real-time information-based control in response to constantly changing data. One of the motivating examples will be aerial vehicles tracking unknown numbers of targets on the ground in a highly occluded environment such as a forest or an urban setting. Additionally, a robotic arm, already used for assistive device research, will be used to implement and assess the proposed methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prior to the vertebrate invasion of land 385 million years ago, vision, our most powerful long-range sense, took in a largely blurry world at short range while underwater, with little variability in scene as the eyes move. Once on land, vision takes in a high contrast world at long range, with high variability as the eyes move. A possible reason for the greatly increased size and complexity of terrestrial vertebrate brains over those of fish is that this environment provides selective advantage to long sequences of actions toward distant goals, reaching its most complex form in varieties of prospective cognition in certain mammals and birds. A team of Northwestern researchers will conduct research into the computational, behavioral, and neural basis of planning, rooted in an evolutionary and computational sensory ecology perspective and a commitment to ethologically relevant behaviors. Planning is an immensely important capacity to understand the mechanistic basis of, as it participates in a diverse range of behaviors, and its diminishment favors impulsivity and reliance on the habit system. Up to now, laboratory studies of planning have typically relied on reduced environments and simple behaviors which are either appetitive or (more rarely) aversive, without a sentient target, the dynamics and unpredictability of which is likely key to the adequate analysis of prospective cognition. Methods from neuroengineering and data-intensive neuroscience will be brought to bear on the problem of making a more ethologically relevant, yet tightly controlled approach to investigating planning possible. The computational and behavioral work will be used to guide neurobiological interventions in two of the key brain structures that participate in reactive versus reflective decision making and choice: the striatum and hippocampus. <br/><br/>The team will pursue research with an unusually bold intellectual dynamic range well beyond a typical disciplinary approach, from its motivation rooted in evolutionary biology and computational sensory ecology, to the extension of the latest machine learning methods, through to single-cell resolution imaging of live animal behavior in a virtual reality system. The researchers will knit together parallel synergistic efforts in the simulation of planning, a mechatronically reconfigurable behavior arena with a robot predator, and two-photon single cell resolution imaging in a virtual reality system, resulting in an ethologically relevant context significantly more complex than current practice in laboratory settings. There are few areas of neuroscience that have as much potential to impact society as research on the neural basis of planning. Discussions of self-control, marshmallow tests, grit, and challenges we face in making long term plans such as retirement or adapting to changing climate for future generations fill the media. One of the team's research goals is to understand the manner in which the nervous system participates in constraining the temporal and spatial range of prospective cognition,which is clearly quite limited even in humans, toward a neuroscience of sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, issues related to long-term reliability of these devices still remain a major concern. Reliability can be defined as the probability of operating a system for a given time under specified conditions without failure. For semiconductor devices, unrecoverable change of a device parameter (such as degradation in the output current) may be considered as a failure. As evidenced in recently reported stress or accelerated tests, high temperature gradients (thermal effect), high electric fields and built-in or induced mechanical stresses (inverse piezoelectric effect), and high current densities (hot carrier effect) may all induce damages or defects in the constituent materials and ultimately lead to device failure. Yet, the exact physical mechanisms governing the defect formation as well as the nature and distribution of these defects are still not clearly understood. This poses a significant challenge to not only interpreting the experimental results but also predicting or extrapolating the device lifetime, tasks that are critical, for example, for devices used in remote applications. It is well acknowledged that to study physical processes that are experimentally intractable, numerical modeling becomes essential. This project sets out to develop a multiscale and multiphysics simulation framework for modeling the time evolution of and the physical mechanisms responsible for AlGaN/GaN HEMT degradation. The developed simulator will enable device design for improved reliability. The simulator and the related instructional materials will be deployed and made freely available on nanoHUB.org for the broader community to use in research and classroom activities. <br/><br/>The objective of the proposed research is to develop a multiscale, multiphysics simulation framework (HEMT 3-D) for modeling device degradation mechanisms in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.

To properly treat the atomistic symmetry in the nanostructured active region as well as the underlying physical processes that are complex, nonlinear, highly stochastic and dynamically-coupled at different length and time scales, the simulator will employ a modular approach integrating first-principles molecular dynamics, lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, and quantum-corrected electron-phonon transport kernels. Portability and run-time efficiency of the simulator will be achieved through the use of open-source scientific software, compilers and libraries, as well as incorporating optimized models, algorithms and extensions for GPGPU platforms. Verification of the computational results will be considered at every stage of the software development effort against experimental data available in literature as well as through collaboration with experimentalists in research laboratories, academia and industries."

It is then critically important to correctly account for emissions related to electricity generation, delivery and consumption. The emissions can be monitored and measured directly at the power plants. However, it has been called ""impossible"" to trace the emissions associated with electricity consumption back to generation sources. Because of this daunting difficulty, an accurate life-cycle analysis of electricity generation and usage cannot be done so far while such analysis is important to various products and processes including GHG inventories of different entities and regions.  Moreover, it has also been very challenging or impossible to carry out clear and unequivocal cost and usage allocation analysis to equally share the benefit and responsibility for all entities involved in electricity generation and delivery. The importance of equity can never be overstated when designing and implementing public policy and engineering practices for interconnected power systems that include numerous generators and cover a vast area. The proposed research work will develop the right tools to link loads and generation/emission sources, to carry out effective cost and benefit analyses, and to help develop appropriate electric energy and environmental related policies to share responsibility among different entities, and ultimately maintain transparency, equity and fairness in electric power industry.

The market share of GaN devices is expected to reach a staggering $15.6 billion by 2022 mainly due to the growing demands in the power and energy sector, the communication infrastructure sector, and the power electronics market. SiC power devices are also expected to grow at equally impressive rates. These new power devices are expected to reduce overall energy conversion losses resulting in an annual savings in the tens of billions of dollars in the US alone. A high-efficiency and green energy infrastructure is vital for reducing overall expenditures and reducing carbon footprint in the environment. These new technologies demand more package level integration to achieve low inductance, balanced impedances, and appropriate thermal management to realize the high performance and long life they promise. The expected outcome from this research effort is a software tool incorporating advanced algorithms that will improve design productivity for engineers while simultaneously enhancing performance and reliability of multi-chip power modules in an analogous way that modern design tools ensure the same for integrated circuitry (IC). Design tools in the IC industry have played an indispensable role in the tremendous advances in consumer electronics worldwide.

Further, industrial feedback with respect to those early findings indicate that manufacturability is a first order concern in cost reduction and successful market introduction of wide bandgap power electronics. Electronic packaging must be carefully considered for both performance and reliability. The goals of this research are to create an optimization-driven method for producing the geometrical layouts of multi-chip power modules (MCPMs) that account for the simultaneous electrical, thermal and mechanical issues that can adversely impact performance and reliability of the electronics. Advances in electrical parasitics modeling, thermal modeling, mechanical stress/strain modeling, and optimization algorithms are all expected as part of the project roadmap. These advances will culminate in a software tool that can synthesize geometrical layouts that minimize and balance electrical parasitics, manage thermal distribution in-package, and mitigate mechanical stresses that sacrifice module integrity.

Such information would help system operators, utilities, energy efficiency providers, and demand response providers improve power system reliability, economic efficiency, and environmental impact. However, sensing infrastructure is costly, especially when considering the large number of quantities we might be interested in measuring. The goal of this research is to develop methods to infer the real-time behavior of aggregations of distributed energy resources from existing power system measurements, which are hierarchical, heterogeneous, incomplete, and of varying quality. To do this, the researchers are applying and extending emerging online learning techniques that leverage dynamical system models.  While methodological developments are grounded in the power system application at hand, the extensions are informing new research directions for signal processing. Knowledge of what can and cannot be inferred from existing data will help utilities determine the value of additional sensors, what type of sensors are needed for different applications, and where to put them.  This will also help policy makers determine which infrastructure investments are worthwhile and the need, if any, for subsidies. Additionally, the results will inform energy policy discussions on the value and cost of consumer privacy, which will help develop policies that better balance the objectives of power system operators, utilities, and third-party companies with those of consumers.  <br/><br/>The research is applying an emerging technique, online learning with dynamics (OLWD), to determine what can and cannot be inferred from both existing power system measurements and measurements that we might expect to have in the near term. Contemporary online learning algorithms do not handle time-varying phenomena because they do not include dynamical models, and classical online estimation algorithms are not robust to model misspecification. In contrast, OLWD uses a collection of models (of arbitrary form) and the algorithm simultaneously estimates state and selects the model or combination of models that best predicts the state at the next time step.  OLWD is based on one of the most successful current online optimization algorithms, inheriting many of its appealing properties.  While the approach is well-suited to the problem, the theory is incomplete. A key component of the research is extend OLWD to handle measurements that are hierarchical, heterogeneous, incomplete, and of varying quality.  The researchers are exploring both passive online inference and active online inference, where the latter uses external control (e.g., of controllable loads and curtailable solar photovoltaics) to enhance learning. Additionally, the researchers are characterizing trade-offs between system cost, inference accuracy, and consumer privacy."

Broadly speaking, reinforcement learning applied to physical systems is concerned with making predictions from data to control the system to extremize a performance criterion. The project will particularly focus on developing theory and algorithms applicable to hybrid and multi-agent control systems, that is, systems with continuous and discrete elements and systems with multiple decision-making agents, which are ubiquitous in CPS across spatiotemporal scales and application domains. Reinforcement learning algorithms are not yet mature enough to guarantee performance when applied to control of CPS. In light of these limitations, this project aims to lay the theoretical and computational foundation to certify reinforcement learning algorithms so that they may be deployed in society with high confidence.<br/><br/>This project will certify reinforcement learning algorithms that compute optimal control policies in systems with non-classical dynamics and non-classical costs. To achieve this goal, we will generalize convergent algorithms originally designed for purely continuous systems to apply in hybrid control systems whose states undergo a mixture of discrete and continuous transitions. Moreover, we specifically aim to ensure this approach is applicable to societal-scale CPS in which multiple agents, some of which may be humans, interact directly with the CPS. These algorithms will be experimentally validated on three testbeds that represent a range of hybrid and multi-agent phenomena that arise in CPS. The first testbed will test the performance of our algorithms on societal-scale traffic flow networks via simulation. The second testbed will consider heterogeneous teams of aerial and terrestrial mobile robots collaborating with human partners to perform construction, inspection, and maintenance tasks on scale facsimiles of infrastructure like bridges, and tunnels. The third testbed will study the closed-loop interaction between individual humans and remote, teleoperated robots that perform dynamic locomotion and manipulation behaviors. This project will also co-organize an interdisciplinary workshop with technology policy experts, the results of which will form the basis for an interdisciplinary multi-campus graduate-level seminar run by the PIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the prevailing clocked synchronous digital integrated circuits, synchronized clocks are used to control and coordinate the circuit operation, along with a set of timing constraints such as setup and hold times. These critical timing constraints can be easily broken in extreme environments due to the circuit speed changes, thereby inducing system malfunction. Therefore, innovations are needed to solve these problems and develop extreme environment electronics in order to make contributions to the commercial industry discussed above in efficient and reliable sensing, communication, control, and data processing subsystems.<br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>This GOALI project is a collaborative effort between the University of Arkansas and Radiance Technologies to develop quasi-delay insensitive asynchronous microcontrollers capable of operating reliably under extreme environments without extra protection or control/adjustment. Quasi-delay insensitive asynchronous logic like the NULL Convention Logic (NCL) uses local handshaking protocols in lieu of global clocks to control the circuit behavior. Individual gate delay has no impact on the correctness of the circuit's outputs. This feature guarantees robust circuit operation under extreme environments, making NCL a promising candidate for designing microcontrollers for such applications. However, innovations in microcontroller architecture and NCL circuit design are needed to improve performance, reduce overhead, and enhance the robustness: at the architecture-level, the prevailing bus architecture is unsuitable for NCL and needs to be replaced; the distributed storage mechanism is the weakest link of circuit operation and needs to be reorganized; and the external interrupt handling needs to redesigned as fully asynchronous. At the circuit-level, transistors need to be resized to improve the reliability under extreme environments; NCL logic gate design needs to be modified for low supply voltages; and NCL logic transformation needs to be investigated to improve the performance. With the industry-standard guidance, experience, and assistance from Radiance Technologies, a prototype NCL microcontroller incorporating the above innovations will be designed, fabricated, and tested. The results will be analyzed for further improvements, dissemination, and technology transfer for potential commercialization."

The project seeks to address fundamentally challenging issues arising from the robust optimal management of large complex systems subject to stochastic effects, nonlinearity, and dynamic uncertainties.  Research findings from this project will contribute new solutions to emerging engineering applications such as the smart electricity grid, robotics, and intelligent transportation systems. The proposed research will have a substantial direct impact upon education at the PI's institution. The interdisciplinary nature of the project should appeal to students from several departments.<br/><br/>The project team will work on stochastic variants of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) for continuous-time systems subject to stochastic and dynamic disturbances. ADP is a practically sound data-driven, non-model based approach for optimal control design in complex systems. ADP has been extensively studied for Markov decision processes, focusing mostly on discrete and finite state-space, and for deterministic (discrete- and continuous-time) dynamic systems. Stability and robustness issues in the presence of dynamic uncertainties are seldom addressed systematically. For problems involving complex modern engineering systems or biological systems, for which stability is an important concern, straightforward application of the existing ADP results does not seem productive or even likely to be successful. Hence, it is necessary to develop novel tools and methods for ADP design of general stochastic systems in continuous-time and continuous state-space, with rigorous stability and convergence analysis. The novelty of the proposed research consists of application and extension of techniques from reinforcement learning, stochastic systems theory, and nonlinear control theory.  The specific goals of the proposal are the development of tools and methods for stochastic adaptive dynamic programming for linear and nonlinear stochastic systems, stochastic adaptive optimal control with robustness to dynamic uncertainties, and application to human motor systems. Rigorous stability proofs, convergence analysis of learning algorithms, and robustness analysis will be pursued. Important classes of continuous-time linear and nonlinear models with multiplicative and additive noise will be studied, along with non-model based, stochastic optimal controller designs. Beyond engineering applications, it is believed that bringing together ADP and research in computational neuroscience may yield new methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative genetic disorders that affect muscle coordination. One such medical condition is Parkinson's disease, which affects approximately seven million people globally, and one million in the United States. Generalizing the PI's recent work in linear stochastic variants of robust adaptive dynamic programming can lead to a potentially new computational mechanism for human motor control."

In order to prevent this problem from occurring, renewable energy solutions must become a larger percentage of the existing energy supply. However, at the current time the amount of solar energy generated electricity from conventional photovoltaic systems varies a great deal during the day due to atmospheric fluctuations such as obscurations from clouds. The proposed work provides a path to solving this problem by reducing the effect of solar intermittency on the output of photovoltaic systems. This will be accomplished through a design methodology that integrates the characteristics of photovoltaic and thermal energy converters, local and regional solar illumination conditions, and optics to optimize the solar conversion system temporal uniformity and overall output power. The systems will use several types of photovoltaic cells to increase solar conversion efficiency, thermal converters that respond more slowly to cloud obscuration to dampen variability, and optical techniques to increase utilization of the available sunlight for both types of converters and to optimize the overall system electricity output. This design process will lead to the production of higher quality renewable energy that will be more useful to utility companies for electrical grid applications. In addition to the technical benefits, the proposed work provides opportunities for new engineering students to learn the essentials of solar energy component and system design. Students are eager to become involved solving climate and energy problems and this project offers excellent opportunities to educate and train them for research and the work place. In addition, reliable, low cost solar energy systems will allow use on Native American reservations and in third world countries where electrical power is not readily available. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel holographic light management methodology that integrates different types of solar converters to provide more useful electrical power from the solar resource. In particular, holographic light management techniques will be used to optimize the output of hybrid photovoltaic/solar thermal converters to mitigate the effects of daytime solar intermittency on photovoltaic (PV) system performance. This will be achieved by developing light management designs that provide: full spectrum utilization, high efficiency PV spectrum splitting, and solar thermal conversion for short term energy storage. In addition, holographic configurations will be examined to allow operation of high efficiency spectrum splitting PV systems during diffuse illumination conditions to further extend the energy yield capability of PV systems. Solving these two problems will significantly increase the energy capacity factor of PV systems. The potential contributions of this work include: 1) development of a holographic light management methodology that integrates imaging and non-imaging optical design, holographic and conventional optics, PV cell and solar thermal converter parameters, and local and regional solar illumination data to design systems for full solar spectrum utilization that mitigate daytime atmospheric intermittency effects on electricity output; 2) design, fabrication, and evaluation of holographic optics that control concentration ratio, spectral bandwidth, and geometrical form factor for optimum solar energy conversion under direct sunlight illumination conditions; and 3) development of high efficiency spectrum-splitting holographic systems for operation with diffuse illumination conditions. These contributions will lead to renewable energy systems that can be used more reliably by utility companies and greater insertion into the electrical grid. This in turn will diminish the negative effects of fossil fuels on the climate and provide a better quality of life for the Nation and World's population."

By forming narrow beams in both the azimuth and elevation directions, 3D beamforming allows efficient spatial division and leads to higher user capacity, better coverage, less interference, and better energy efficiency. The true promise of this technology, however, has not yet been realized due to immense challenges in both hardware and algorithms. Existing beamforming approaches rely on phased array antennas with bulky, power-hungry phase shifters and related amplifiers and size not suitable for practical handsets. True mmWave beamforming requires thin, lightweight antennas with the ability to produce sharp beams that are electronically steerable over a wide range of angles in three dimensions. For effective beamforming, there is an added difficulty in estimating the channel accurately at both the receiver and transmitter because of strong directionality of mmWave propagation, its high path loss and vulnerability to shadowing and blockage. Such channel conditions call for robust 3D beamforming algorithms that are tightly coupled to novel antenna designs in order to integrate them into efficient communication systems.<br/><br/>This proposal puts forth several key innovations spanning across signal processing, antenna design and integrated system levels.   (1)   The signal processing innovation lies in robust 3D beamforming algorithms for a planar antenna array, taking into account errors in channel estimation, particularly in angles of departure and arrival specific to mmWave propagation, and also variation in antenna beam formation caused by inherent non-idealities in hardware and process mismatch specific for the proposed metamaterial antenna. Both of these sources of error have not previously been considered.  (2)  The hardware innovation lies in the use of metamaterial-based resonant cavity transmit/receive antennas that are ultra-thin for electronic beam steering, achieved by embedding active components such as varactors in the metamaterial that are biased intelligently in software. The proposed antenna is a fundamental shift from the existing phase-array antennas with bulky mechanical moving parts or phase shifters and related amplifiers, thereby also saving significant power, while providing flexible narrow beam-width of wide steering angles.  (3) These two innovative aspects are then integrated in a multi-level evaluation plan, including detailed testing and evaluation at component (antenna), system (transceiver pair), and network (cellular) levels. Characterized antenna beam profile is integrated in a network simulation that implements the proposed robust 3D beamforming with detailed mmWave channel model. Project results are expected to have direct impact on mmWave communications in meeting the demand for high data rate connectivity in cellular, vehicular, and IoT systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, cancer results when there is excessive cell division or reduced cell death due to some malfunctioning in the cell number control system.  A possible approach to cancer therapy is to quickly and robustly induce the death of cancer cells and this project seeks to use an engineering approach to explain the rationale behind the dramatically successful induction of cell death by a particular therapeutic molecule. In addition, the hope is that in the process, additional therapeutic molecules will be discovered and successfully validated. Since the work is driven by the goal of improving cancer treatment, the potential societal benefits of this project could be enormous. In addition, the project will be carried out at the newly formed Center for Bioinformatics and Genomic Systems Engineering (CBGSE) at Texas A & M University, where widespread dissemination of the research results, imparting truly interdisciplinary hands-on education to graduate students, and beneficially targeting minorities and minority institutions, are top priorities. <br/><br/>Cancer is an umbrella term for a large number of diseases that are associated with loss of cell-cycle control, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. This loss of cell-cycle control usually manifests itself as malfunction(s) in the cellular signaling pathways. These malfunctions can occur in many different ways and at many different locations in a particular pathway. As a result, a proper design of cancer therapy should first attempt to identify the location and type of malfunction in the pathway and then arrive at a drug or drug combination that is particularly well suited for it. Unfortunately, the current approach to cancer therapy does not follow such a systematic procedure. Thus, for the vast majority of cancers, there is a critical need for precisely identifying the failure point(s) in the pathway, hopefully leading to a more targeted therapy with a better likelihood of success.<br/>Many of the cancer therapies to date have mostly focused on blocking the pathways essential to cell proliferation. However, more often than not, even if the drugs are initially successful in treating the cancer, the success is usually short lived as the cancer cell is able to activate some other pathways not targeted by the drug. An alternative approach to treat cancer would be to use drugs that are capable of inducing cell death. Chemotherapeutic drugs targeting cell death also display drug resistance which occurs when the cancer cells figure out mechanisms to evade the cell death inducing activity of the drug. If, however, one could identify molecules along the cell death pathway that can play a decisive role in ensuring cell death, regardless of the upstream signaling breakdown(s), then targeting such molecules with drugs would provide a robust strategy for treating cancer. Based mainly on expert domain knowledge, one such molecule MCL1 has been identified over the last couple of years. This molecule has remarkable success in achieving robust cell killing across a diverse panel of melanoma cell lines has also been experimentally demonstrated. Motivated by this preliminary success, the goal of this project is to combine prior pathway information concerning cell death along with data, in a Bayesian framework, to develop models that would allow the identification of decisive modulators of cell death. The effectiveness of the modulators identified will also be experimentally validated."

These waves can travel very long distances with little energy loss. Most importantly, these waves are a source of clean energy readily available for harvesting using appropriate wave energy converters such as oscillating water column converters. Currently, most ocean wave energy conversion projects deal with design, development and testing of single wave energy converters. This research project proposes a vision of a large-scale wave energy conversion park which is capable of generating the electrical power of a large power generating plant. To achieve this goal, a wave energy converter park can be designed as a large intelligent system with intra wave energy converters communication, supervisory global control, and active local control to maximize clean electrical energy generation. The main benefit from the application of the ideas herein proposed is a significant increase in year-round electricity productivity. In fact, it can be shown that hydrodynamic active control as proposed in this research project could increase annual energy conversion productivity by a factor in the range of 1.5 to 2.8.<br/><br/>Most wave energy converters absorb energy by means of an oscillatory motion that makes waves which constructively and/or destructively interfere with the incoming waves. A wave energy converter with fixed geometry and mass possesses a natural period, and it is known that the energy absorption from the sea is largest when the natural period agrees with the wave period, namely at resonance. When this is not the case, a passive wave energy converter has a natural response that is not optimal. This means that there is a possible motion other than the natural one that would absorb more energy. Specifically, in terms of sinusoidal waves and oscillations, there exist optimal values of phase and amplitude of the natural response which could be matched by the wave energy converter using optimal control. Hence, an optimal active control of the primary conversion system can be devised so that the electricity production can be maximized. In essence, what active control can do is to use the machinery in a purposeful way to change the dynamical resistance and mechanical reactance felt by the waves when they act upon the wave energy converter. Therefore, the proposed research will develop new active control techniques which will modify the motion of a wave energy converter closer to one or both of these parameters using both local and global wave climate information gathered by a network of sensors deployed on the wave energy park and other sources such as National Data Buoy Center."

The latest Mercedes S-class sedan applies corrective action when its driver strays out of lane or tailgates too closely.  Semi-autonomy will soon yield to full autonomy. Nissan has promised a line of self-driving cars by 2020.  Maritime craft are likewise moving from rudimentary autopilots to full autonomy, and autonomous aerial vehicles will doubtless play a significant role in the future economy.<br/><br/>Current versions of these vehicles are cocooned in an array of sensors, but neither the sensors nor the timing, navigation, and collision avoidance algorithms they feed have been designed for security against malicious attacks.  Radar and acoustic sensors transmit predictable, uncoded signals; vehicle-to-vehicle communication protocols are either unauthenticated or critically dependent on insecure civil GPS signals (or both); and vehicle state estimators are designed for robustness but not security.  These vulnerabilities are not merely conceptual: GPS spoofing attacks have been demonstrated against a drone and an ocean vessel, causing the drone to crash and the vessel to veer off course; likewise, it appears possible to cause road accidents by fooling a car's radar sensor into thinking a crash is imminent, thus triggering automatic braking.  <br/><br/>This proposal seeks funding to fix these vulnerabilities by developing sensors and high-level decision-making algorithms that are hardened against such so-called field attacks.  The goal of secure control systems is to survive and operate safely despite sensor measurements or control commands being compromised.  This proposal focuses on an emergent category of cyber-physical attack that has seen little scrutiny in the secure control literature.  Like cyber attacks, these attacks are hard to detect and can be executed from a distance, but unlike cyber attacks, they are effective even against control systems whose software, data, and communications networks are secure, and so can be considered a more menacing long-term threat.  These are attacks on the physical fields such as electromagnetic, magnetic, acoustic, etc. measured by system sensors. As specialized sensor attacks, field attacks seek to compromise a system's perception of reality non-invasively from without, not from within. We emphasize field attacks against navigation, collision avoidance, and synchronization sensors, as these are of special importance to the rise of autonomous vehicles and the smart grid. This proposal's goal is to develop a coherent analytical foundation for secure perception in the presence of field attacks and to develop a suite of algorithms and tools to detect such attacks.  A key insight behind this proposal's approach is that the physics of field attacks impose fundamental difficulties on the attacker that can be exploited and magnified to enable attack detection.  This work will progressively build security into navigation, collision avoidance, and timing perception from the physical sensory layer to the top-level state estimation algorithms. The outcome of this work will be smarter, more skeptical sensor systems for autonomous vehicles and other autonomous systems."

Mid-IR sensors using this remarkable property are capable of identification, classification, and localization of a wide class of threatening, hazardous, and lethal particles, but methods for generating and transmitting mid-IR light are expensive and inefficient. The emerging technology of chalcogenide glass fiber devices promises to transform mid-IR sensor technologies, with potential benefit for millions of Americans whose lives are threatened by hazardous aerosol particles in their workplaces or from possible chemical attacks by terrorists. Advances in generating and transmitting mid-IR light have opened the possibility for inexpensive and efficient mid-IR sensors that continuously monitor threatening aerosol particles and transmit alerts to risk management and homeland security personnel in case of impending emergencies. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is to design chalcogenide fiber devices that will enable practical realization of sensor technologies with a variety of important applications such as biosensing, environmental monitoring, homeland security, and medical diagnostics. This project will broaden collaborations between academic researchers and the photonics industry. It will expand mentorship of underrepresented students by the principal investigator. It will also help the principal investigator to integrate research into university coursework and improve outreach efforts to local K-12 school students to spark interest in lasers/photonics and STEM fields. This project will help cultivate the research environment at the Baylor Research and Innovation Collaborative (BRIC), which is designed to foster interdisciplinary research between university faculty, industry partners, and area organizations. The outcome of this project will be disseminated through publications. The proposed research, undertaken in collaboration with industry partners, will lead to further commercial development of sensing components in the important mid-IR field.<br/><br/>Technical description: Our goal is to integrate modeling and prototyping in collaboration with industrial partners to determine the key factors that guide and support the development of reliable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient mid-IR spectroscopy. The primary challenge is to find the best fiber technology to generate and transmit mid-IR light sources in terms of efficiency, cost, power consumption, bandwidth, bend resistance, weight, and portability. To address this challenge, recent studies have identified the need for increased understanding of generation of mid-IR laser sources using chalcogenide glass fiber and delivery of high power mid-IR laser sources using chalcogenide negative curvature fibers. The research team's unique combination of expertise in optics and photonics, photonic crystal fibers, chalcogenide glass fibers, and computer modeling will permit the researchers to design efficient mid-IR chalcogenide glass fiber devices for a variety of applications. This program will lead to the creation of new applications that rely on high power lasers in the mid-IR region. The new negative curvature fibers with a broad transmission window will also transform the hollow core fibers to be used in devices with various potential applications. The comparison between theoretical models and experimental data will identify limiting factors in the devices and facilitate further improvements in experimental performance. The expected intellectual significance of the proposed project will be to turn the theory to practice for the devices in mid-IR applications including both generation and delivery of mid-IR light sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One reason is that, once a magnetic field is created it can supply an almost limitless force, such as the Lorentz force, on electrical charges and currents. If this could be exploited then one could have optical, electronic, and data storage technologies that operate on very low power with low energy consumption. Unfortunately, typical magnets, such as a refrigerator magnet, cannot change the optical properties of materials because it applies very weak forces on the charges flowing within the solids and liquids in our familiar environment. This is one reason why nature does not have examples of materials whose optical properties are controllable by magnetic fields. Here the researchers propose to solve this problem by utilizing the fact that when a material melts or freezes, a short lived (few nanoseconds) but extremely large current can be generated at the boundary between the solid and liquid regions. This transient current could be large enough such that, when a refrigerator magnet is brought in its vicinity, the material can be deformed substantially. Thus, physical properties such as the transmission of light can be dramatically changed. They call this effect the MAgneto-THermal or MaTh effect and anticipate the creation of a new type of high-speed optical switching device based on reversibly changing its light transparency. Such devices could find application in optical and quantum computing hardware and in electronic components. <br/>Large transient thermal gradients involving a solidification or melting front can be created within nanomaterials by heating by nanosecond pulsed laser light. Preliminary hypothesis suggests that at the boundary of a moving phase front, i.e. solidification or melting front, the mass density difference creates a charge imbalance resulting in a large transient current density. Thermal modeling studies and experiments show that metal nanoparticles in the 10-100 nm size range melted by nanosecond pulses can undergo shape deformation and even break-up in the presence of moderate magnetic fields. Since these shape changes and break-up effects can be reversed by laser thermal dewetting effects, a very fast change in optical properties can be achieved in the presence of a simultaneous magnetic and thermal field. The goal of the research is to  design, fabricate, and demonstrate an optical device based on the magnetic field break-up and thermal field re-assembly of metal nanoparticles. The researchers plan to use a combination of thin film deposition, cost-effective nanosphere lithography, etching, pulsed laser melting, and optical characterization. They will investigate the device performance as a function of laser and materials parameters. They anticipate that the proposed tasks will also enhance their fundamental understanding of the coupled magnetic-thermal effect. Therefore, new knowledge as well as a new technology is expected from the planned experimental and theoretical investigations."

Where most types of imaging use the intensity and/or wavelength as contrast mechanisms and ignore the polarization, there is often much information to be obtained by examining the polarization state of the light reflected or transmitted from a scene. Compared to other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, in the terahertz frequency range (300 GHz-10 THz), polarization has been underutilized as a contrast mechanism for imaging. A major application of terahertz radiation is for non-destructive evaluation due its ability to penetrate many visibly opaque materials for example pharmaceutical tablet coatings, foams, paints, covered art and antiquities. Polarization can potentially provide significant improvement in the utility of terahertz imaging for non-destructive evaluation due to its ability provide information about material birefringence, surface features, shape, roughness, edge detail, and chirality.  The theme of this research is the development of a new type of terahertz laser in which the polarization of the emitted light can be chosen and switched rapidly, by electronic control, without moving parts. The approach is based upon the adaptation of antenna design concepts from the microwave frequency range, and combining them with terahertz laser design. The developed lasers will then be used as illumination sources for polarization-based imaging, with a particular emphasis on evaluating their suitability for non-destructive evaluation applications. As a part of the project, the research will train graduate and undergraduate students, and will support recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities to engineering through the PI's participation in a targeted research project course.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is the development of terahertz active polarization imaging based upon THz quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) as an illumination source.  First, an innovative scheme is proposed where the output polarization of QCLs can be modulated electronically. This scheme is based upon terahertz metamaterial antennas or phased arrays of lasers that are designed to radiate with overlapping beams, but with orthogonal polarization. By controlling the relative phase of the laser radiation, the output polarization can be dynamically switched between various linear and circular polarization states. This will allow more rapid and stable modulation of the output polarization compared to current schemes based upon rotating polarizers and waveplates, which in turn will allow faster data collection with reduced noise and a more compact and lightweight system. Second, the developed QCLs will be applied to polarimetric imaging in several schemes, and their performance will be quantified versus conventional techniques. The developed technology has the potential to impact many nondestructive evaluation applications including corrosion detection and monitoring, bioimaging, security screening and illicit material detection, and manufacturing process quality control."

The theoretical work of this project will also contribute to establishing a basis for dynamics studies for the future power system infrastructure. Several power system problems can be studied using the proposed mathematical development, such as controller designs for renewable generation, smart grid dynamic operation, electricity markets, and others. Besides advancing research knowledge on power system dynamics, this project will bring further development in control theory that is applicable to many other systems and industrial processes from the fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and management. The PIs plan to leverage research results for curriculum development in new courses on power system dynamics and control. The researchers will also have support from the Office of Diversity, College of Engineering, and the Office of Information Technology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.<br/><br/>This project will investigate a criterion to identify the best locations of fast energy storage systems (FESS) to improve power system dynamic performance and design appropriate controls for FESS. The future power grid is likely to be characterized by a high penetration of renewable energy interfaced to the grid through power electronics, and this may result in poor dynamic performance due to the reduction of inertia and a high variability on the generation side. To measure dynamic performance improvement, features such as frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency, and low frequency oscillation damping, among others, are considered. This work would be among the first to propose a solution for the FESS location problem while considering the full mathematical complexities of power system dynamics (large dimensionality, dynamics in different time scales, linear and nonlinear elements, and others). Although the modeling of this problem is highly complex, one of the proposal hypotheses is the existence of a criterion for FESS location based on specific physical characteristics of a power system, such as distribution of inertia, distribution of response speed of synchronous generators, and grid topology. Data analytics will be used to identify correlations between the optimal location and power system characteristics and, based on the numerical results, the theoretical development of the criterion will be derived. This characterization would allow planners to carefully strengthen the grid dynamics with the advent of increased renewable generation. In addition, this research seeks to establish three control strategies for FESS: (a) a continuous control scheme; (b) a discrete control scheme that determines the specific time when FESS need to change their discrete states (three states are considered: idle, discharge, and charge); and (c) a hybrid control scheme that combines the discrete state transitions and the continuous stored energy control within a particular discrete state. The hybrid control scheme is expected to provide the best dynamic improvement and, at the same time, is expected to extend the lifespan of FESS. The potential of phasor measurement units (PMUs) is considered to facilitate coordinating control loops among FESS, conventional generation, and renewable generation."

Mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrometers are of particular importance to sensing and imaging applications, since many biochemical molecules have spectral ""fingerprints"" in the mid-IR frequency. However, the large size, weight, and cost of existing mid-IR spectrometers has limited their adoption despite the broad range of potential applications. In this work, the investigators will leverage advances in integrated photonics to develop chip-scale mid-IR spectrometers which are low-cost, compact, and lightweight. The chip-scale mid-IR spectrometers will utilize a new design paradigm based on ""complex photonic structures"" to achieve the same performance as the existing tabletop mid-IR spectrometers. The chip-scale mid-IR spectrometers will have wide-spread applications from trace-gas sensing for pollution control and environmental monitoring to combustion analysis and medical diagnostics. The investigators will integrate the research with education including training graduate and undergraduate students, curriculum development and outreach activities. <br/><br/>The development of a high-resolution chip-scale spectrometer could enable portable, low-cost spectroscopy for field sensing as well as enhancing lab-on-a-chip functionality. Among the different types of on-chip spectrometers that have been developed, none of them is applicable to the mid-infrared (IR) frequency because of the long wavelength and large detector noise. Current IR spectrometers rely on the multiplex advantage (the so-called Fellgett's advantage) to achieve an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. These spectrometers operate by scanning a mirror over a long distance, which cannot be easily adopted on-chip. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel on-chip spectrometers capable of utilizing the Fellgett's advantage to achieve the level of sensitivity required for mid-IR sensing applications, while maintaining small footprint, high-resolution, broad-bandwidth, and low-loss. The investigators will leverage the unique characteristic of complex photonic structures, which provide broadband, non-resonant enhancement of optical pathlengths in a limited footprint to develop chip-scale spectrometers. They propose three spectrometer designs based on (i) a disordered structure, (ii) a chaotic cavity, (iii) a spiral waveguide, which provide different spectral resolution, footprint and sensitivity, and are therefore optimized for different applications. Each spectrometer consists of a complex photonic structure with a single input waveguide and a single output waveguide. The transmitted light intensity is recorded as the refractive index of the complex structure is modulated (e.g., via the thermo-optic or electro-optic effect). The input spectrum is then recovered with the calibration data describing the system response to different wavelengths and refractive indices. This approach can achieve the Fellgett?s advantage in a chip-scale spectrometer without moving components while maintaining a small footprint. The complex systems such as disordered structures and chaotic cavities can have extremely sensitive response to changes in the probe wavelength and refractive index modulation, thus enhancing the spectral resolution and operation bandwidth. Finally, the insights gained through the proposed work into novel photonic structures with broadband pathlength enhancement could enable additional applications in on-chip sensing and imaging."

While network operators and researchers have done a tremendous job to improve the capacity of existing networks, there is a strong need to explore new options to support the exponentially growing wireless Internet traffic.  This research will investigate a completely new spectrum in the mm-wave band that could enable Gigabit links for mobile users, allowing network operators to expand capacity in a graceful manner.  Up to now, mm-wave communication has been mostly limited to either point-to-point links or to short-range communication for fixed terminals. Using mm-wave radios for mobile communication requires a complete rethinking and co-design of the circuits, antennas, packages, and systems and protocols. This research will explore the design of mm-wave circuits and systems at 120 GHz, enabling large arrays of radios to communicate with very high data rates (> 10 Gbps) over relatively long ranges (hundreds of meters). Compared to research below 100 GHz, this area is relatively unexplored, with only about a dozen demonstrations of working transceivers. The research team will investigate system and circuit architectures to support beam forming, beam nulling, multi-user MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), allowing efficient spectrum re-use through spatial filtering and interference rejection. Novel circuit design concepts will be prototyped in 28 nm CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Silicon) technology along with GaN (Gallium Nitride) transistors for high power transmission. Today's mm-wave transmitters are extremely inefficient when the waveform has a high peak to average ratio (2% average efficiency), whereas the proposed transmitter architectures will increase both the output power and efficiency by an order of magnitude. The range of mm-wave systems realized in CMOS, particularly without the use of lens, will also be increased from a few meters to hundreds of meters. This research will enable the exploitation of completely untapped spectrum for 5G cellular and beyond applications.<br/><br/>The technical objective of the proposed collaborative research project is to focus on circuit and system level realization of a hardware platform that can enable the study of optimal beam forming and beam nulling (interference cancellation), while allowing practical measurements to be carried out on the propagation characteristics of indoor and outdoor channels above 100 GHz. Specifically, the PI, co-PI and a team of researchers will design and implement key building blocks for the transceiver to enable measurement and characterization of communication above 100 GHz. This project involves four main thrust areas to be investigated. The first thrust area will focus on transmitter circuit design and integration challenges and explore technology limits for silicon-based power amplifiers for MIMO applications in CMOS, especially above 100 GHz. The second thrust will provide insight regarding the integration of GaN transistors with CMOS to allow for high-density logic for digital signal processing and waveform shaping, and high breakdown voltage GaN devices for power generation. The third thrust will focus on antenna and system architectures to support beam forming with special attention to solving problems regarding LO (local oscillator) generation and distribution and finding the optimal configuration to minimize power consumption in a large array. The final thrust area will focus on investigating system level integration challenges from the sub-modules developed in the other thrust areas to produce a 120GHz transceiver."

The proposal is separated into three aims: 1) develop calcium sensors and optogenetic channels active on different wavelength ranges to allow simultaneous readout and control, 2) develop a dual-beam two photon microscope, and 3) develop imaging software that can process neural activity in real-time. <br/><br/>Nontechnical <br/>Understanding neural function requires examining specific subsets of the vast numbers of neurons in the brain. Recently developed optogenetics tools, such as optogenetic stimulation and calcium imaging, have partially fulfilled the need to target these specific sets of neurons and study their function. These techniques deliver engineered genes to targeted neural populations, and use light to manipulate or measure neural activity. Current optogenetic tools lack the spatiotemporal resolution to causally study many individual neurons in parallel on fast time scales; they only make broad conclusions either on near-millimeter sized brain regions, or over the timescale of many action potentials. We propose to integrate the design and implementation of optical and genetic tools to greatly refine the scale of investigating neural activity. Specifically, we will create two optically independent channels: one channel for fast, spatially precise optical patterning to control individual neurons; and one channel for independent recording of neural activity from individual neurons. We will then integrate these two channels by creating software that instantaneously patterns optical excitation based on the optical recording. Integrative design and engineering of this expansive set of tools will enable neuroscientists to quickly manipulate and control large populations of single neurons, a capability that does not exist presently. Our technology will allow the community to directly explore how neural activity patterns of many individual neurons in one brain region drive downstream neural activity. This novel probing of functional connectivity is exactly the type of study needed to better understand the coordination of neural activity in healthy and diseased brains. Beyond the specific application of neuroscience, training students within our multidisciplinary setting will create the next generation of scientists capable of tackling the broad set of technical challenges facing society today. <br/><br/><br/>Technical <br/>Optical imaging of brain activity has steadily developed into a staple technique within neuroscience labs over the past decade. In combination with genetically encoded sensors of neural activity, optical methods enable genetic targeting and chronic, simultaneous imaging of many individual neurons. One significant weakness of existing optical techniques when compared to electrophysiology is the inability to simultaneously measure and control the activity of a neuron in real time. We propose to address this shortcoming by developing an optical imaging system and data processing software suite that will enable real-time optical readout of neural activity and real-time neural feedback via optical excitation, all with cellular level specificity and in parallel over a large population of neurons. This new ability to optically record and manipulate many genetically or functionally specified neurons individually will augment current studies using bulk neural activation or inhibition; the fine scale perturbations of neurons will tease apart the details of neural circuits. Specifically, we will engineer a set of optogenetic actuators, fluorescent sensors, and microscopy tools that will enable optical readout and control of neurons in different wavelength channels. We will also develop fast image processing algorithms that quickly convert images to neural activity of individual neurons, thereby enabling real-time control of neural activity based on the optical readout. Recently, improvements to these tools occurred independently. Our proposal will address the integrated development of the tool set, and effectively employ trade-offs between the individual components. For example, simultaneous engineering of the protein sensor, imaging processing software, and optical imaging hardware will optimize the readout fidelity. Similarly, joint design of the genetic tools' spectral separation and the optical spatiotemporal resolution will extend optical control precision. Integration of these developments to examine neural function at the cellular level is unprecedented: successful advancement of this research will enable novel examination of the brain and help guide targeted biomedical therapi"

However, many recent experimental studies have observed that the mechanical quality factor, Q, defined as the ratio of the energy stored to the energy lost per unit period, of NEMS is much lower than those from theoretical predictions. This discrepancy can be attributed to the novel physics that arises at the nanoscale and is not accounted for in the classical theory. The attainable frequencies in NEMS are comparable to the phonon frequencies and this can introduce new sources of intrinsic dissipation, such as Akhiezer damping, which can significantly reduce the quality factors. In addition, as the surface to volume ratio is higher at nanoscale, surfaces act as an additional source of dissipation reducing the Q. To realize the full potential of NEMS, it is important to develop a comprehensive physical understanding of all dissipation mechanisms at nanoscale. Through this knowledge, high Q nanostructures can be engineered. Since classical theories do not adequately describe dissipation at nanoscale, the focus of this project is to develop atomistic and multiscale approaches to understand dissipation in nanostructures.<br/><br/>This project will provide interdisciplinary research, education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and the research results will be widely disseminated for broader impact.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>Two types of mechanical losses, namely intrinsic and extrinsic, will be considered and understood. Intrinsic losses or energy dissipation mechanisms are those that are inherent to the nanostructure. Popular sources of intrinsic dissipation are Akhiezer damping, thermo-elastic damping, surfaces, defects, etc. Most nanostructures operate in a fluid medium, so in addition to intrinsic losses, extrinsic losses, defined as the dissipation caused by the fluid, also needs to be taken into account.  The key objectives of this project are to (i) Develop atomistic and multiscale computational approaches to understand intrinsic losses in a variety of one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanostructures. Comprehensive theories to model Akhiezer, thermo-elastic, defects, surfaces and other sources of intrinsic dissipation will be developed. (ii) Develop atomistic and multiscale computational approaches to understand extrinsic losses. To determine extrinsic losses, coupled fluidic and structural analysis is necessary. To compute fluidic forces acting on the nanostructure, a comprehensive multiscale approach will be developed. The multiscale approach for fluidic analysis will be coupled with a multiscale approach for nanostructural analysis to determine extrinsic losses.

In fact, it finds its way into so many modern day technologies that it is indispensable in the modern world such as in wireless communications, computer technologies, bio-medical engineering, and big data transfer.  Two concepts in electromagnetics have emerged in recent past.  First is the use of computers and mathematical methods that have appeared in the 20th century to solve highly complex electromagnetics, giving rise to the field of computational electromagnetics (CEM).  Second is the study of quantum effects and quantum theory (that also appeared in the 20th century) in electromagnetic systems giving rise to fields like quantum optics that can potentially impact information, communications, and computation technologies such as quantum information, communication, encryption, and computation.  This project will combine the use of computational electromagnetics knowledge to understand quantum systems that interact with electromagnetic fields.  This will engender the development of future quantum technologies that open new gateways to previously untapped possibilities.<br/><br/>This project will develop computational tools to meet the demands of emerging technologies in nano chip, nano optics, and quantum optics.  The modeling of electromagnetic and quantum effects in nanostructures has become increasingly important due to the miniaturization of transistors, optical structures, and quantum information systems. But the exorbitant complexity and computational cost of modeling such problems have precluded their precise solution so far.  The objective of this proposal is to develop fast computational algorithms that can capture circuit physics, wave physics and quantum effects in order to effectively simulate circuit-quantum electrodynamics (C-QED) systems.  This will entail the development of multi-scale, multi-physics solvers while incorporating quantum effects through the use of the dyadic Green?s function.  The resulting codes will be validated against experimental results.  If successful, this research will open up a new frontier on how C-QED systems can be analyzed using fast, stable and accurate computational algorithms.  This in turn would enable new discoveries in C-QED that could impact quantum computing and quantum information processing.  Extensive educational outreach activities are planned including the involvement of K-12 and undergraduate students, and the development of visualization tools and video lectures to disseminate results to the public."

A great proportion of the communications performed in the IoT will be between devices, in so-called machine-to-machine (M2M) systems, and in an increasingly automated manner.  The environments in which IoT devices will operate will often be more complex, cluttered and challenging for wireless communications than either today's ubiquitous mobile communications or wireless data networks.   This research addresses a critical component of the IoT wireless communications link, namely the antenna systems for these small, inexpensive devices. New antenna designs are needed, along with new methods for low-cost digital manufacturing and for testing the devices under realistic operating conditions. The research findings of this project have potential to positively impact the robustness of not only M2M systems but also systems utilized in dynamic environments such vehicle-to-vehicle, first-responder and military field operations. Furthermore, the underlying knowledge could influence the future designs of medical devices, on-body sensor systems, robotic systems, un-manned ground and air vehicles and similar applications where customization, form factor, production volume or other considerations make direct digital manufacturing (DDM) an attractive option. Graduate students from the University of Vermont and the University of South Florida will collaborate with the industry participants from Harris Corporation. The investigators will also work closely with STEM programs targeting high school students, in particular those students from underrepresented and disadvantaged populations, to develop activities that provide insights on the foundations that make wireless communications possible. <br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to techniques and technology that enable wireless devices for Internet of Things (IoT) applications operating at 2.45, 5 and 60 GHz to determine and adapt to the channel impairments using new antenna system designs.  Advanced manufacturing and integration approaches will be studied with the goal of reducing the size and cost of these devices and systems.  The intellectual merit lies in the fusion of ideas from propagation modeling, antenna design and direct digital manufacturing (DDM).  Previous work by the investigators, who have a long and productive history of collaboration, has contributed new understanding of channel conditions for highly cluttered environments, 3D antenna designs, and the use of DDM for microwave circuit and antenna fabrication. The work will leverage this expertise in the investigation of new channel models and the resulting theory that will inform the study of next generation, adaptive antenna systems. A new approach to quantifying antenna system performance based on collecting and analyzing antenna responses to a wide range of channel conditions is the basis for the proposed propagation studies. The orientation, spacing and reconfiguration of antenna elements in a multi-polarization system will be studied using a statistical characterization method. Advanced DDM processes will be investigated using a unique 3D printer that combines plastic extrusion, paste micro-dispensing and laser processing in a single tool.  The new processes will provide the ability to realize 3D structural electronics that comprise package-integrated antenna systems that include ferroelectric tuning networks. The realization of electronically-tunable DDM devices requires a new process to merge a technology with length scales on the order of 10's of microns (DDM) with one having length scales on the order of microns (integrated circuits). The eventual goal of demonstrating, in collaboration with GOALI partner Harris Corp., high performance mm-wave (60 GHz) antenna systems of this nature necessitates tight control over feature sizes and the quality and surface features of printed conductors; the use of pulsed laser processing will be studied as a means to address these challenges."

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) N-1 rule requires that no such single failure should result in system infeasibility, and this rule has been embedded in certain versions of the unit commitment process. The resulting contingency-constrained unit commitment(CCUC) is extremely complex, and the issue is now compounded by the drastic increase in intermittent renewables such as wind or solar. In Spain, for example, it is not uncommon that a drop of wind generation within just a few hours is equivalent to the shutdown of four nuclear units, and this has presented major challenges to system operators. Consideration of contingencies in the presence of intermittent renewables is thus a critical and urgent issue. In collaboration with ISO-NE, Southern California Edison and Alstom Grid, this proposal is on CCUC with high penetration of intermittent renewables. The problem is challenging in view of different types of uncertainties and their magnitudes, the large number of contingencies, the combinatorial nature of mixed-integer optimization, and the largeness of power systems. Our focus will be on novel formulations of interval CCUC, and on advanced optimization methods. The proposed research will have the broader impacts on managing other uncertainties, e.g., N-2 contingencies, and on other complex problems such as microgrid energy optimization. For these problems, difficulties associated with uncertain weather, electricity demand and microgrid-associated intermittent renewables can be modeled by the interval formulation. The resulting mixed-integer linear optimization problems can then benefit from our advanced optimization methods. Furthermore, the research will educate graduate and undergraduate students and professionals through courses, seminars, publications and online materials.  It will also benefit high school students through their teachers? involvement in the daVinci summer project at UConn. The participations of under-represented groups will be actively sought.<br/><br/>Specifically, Task 1 is on formulating CCUC for the co-optimization of energy and reserve considering N-1 contingencies and intermittent renewables. The novel idea lies in using intervals to describe transmission contingencies based on generation shift factors (GSFs), as opposed to analyzing contingencies one at a time. A line flow is a weighted sum of net nodal injections, where weights are GSFs. When a transmission line is tripped, GSFs will be changed. Various transmission contingencies can thus be described by varying values of GSFs, and be modeled by intervals. Conservativeness of this modeling will be alleviated through shrinking ranges of GSFs based on identifying and eliminating redundant contingency transmission constraints, and through improving interval arithmetic, e.g., by using affine arithmetic. Generator contingencies and intermittent renewables will then be incorporated within the interval optimization framework. To effectively solve the problem, Task 2 is on developing a new generation of optimization methods. The key is to synergistically integrate our latest surrogate Lagrangian relaxation(SLR), which exploits separability, with branch-and-cut, which exploits linearity. While SLR requires iterations, by novel exploitation of the invariant nature of subproblem convex hulls across iterations, the overall CPU time and solution quality will be drastically improved. In addition, parallel implementation of our approach will be explored. The method will be tested using realistic data sets from ISO-NE and CAISO."

Their penetration into the market, however, is hindered by two major barriers: cost and reliability.  The objective of this project is to explore new multilevel power conversion architectures leveraging cost-competitive gallium nitride power integrated circuits, and establish a viable technological pathway for breaking through these cost and reliability barriers. The demand for electricity is expected to increase significantly with further electrification of the world driven by renewable energy usage, electrification of transportation, expansion of efficient electrical heating and cooling, expansion of information traffic, increased industrial motor usage, and new smart grid development. By 2030, an estimated 80% of all U.S. electricity is expected to flow through power electronics. Advanced wide bandgap power electronics will play a critical role in all phases of the electricity life cycle including generation, distribution and consumption, and have the potential to improve electricity efficiency by 10-25%. With the proposed advanced converter topologies, it is possible to realize efficiency gains by facilitating higher levels of adoption for cost-effective gallium nitride semiconductors in applications of power supplies, electric vehicles, data centers, solar inverters, power conditioners, electric motor drives, and wind power systems. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to explore scalable multilevel multicell power conversion architectures to extend the power rating of gallium nitride power converters to the range of 100 kW, fully utilizing low-voltage (40-300V), cost-competitive, reliability-proven, commercially available gallium nitride transistors. This is distinctly different from the mainstream approach on developing wide bandgap power converters using high-voltage (>1200V) semiconductor devices, which continue to face cost and reliability challenges. The new approach, originally developed for megawatt industrial applications, if adapted properly for the proposed lower power levels, will offer the same benefits of increased power rating and efficiency, reduced harmonic distortion, electro-magnetic interference, and improved redundancy and reliability, in addition to cost and size reduction.  These objectives will be met through the combination of (1) advanced architectures and topologies, (2) new control strategies and modulation techniques, (3) gallium nitride power IC building blocks and integrated gate driver, and 4) integration and scalability allowing for a broader range of power applications. The research plan includes major research components in the areas of power converter topologies, design, modeling, prototyping, and testing of the power converters; control and modulation techniques; development of gallium nitride device integration and converter scalability strategies; and evaluation and benchmarking against existing solutions."

This concept is being exploited in an imaging and detection method having two facets. In one, speckled patterns of scattered laser light measured as a function of object position are being used to reconstruct the obscured moving object. The initial experiments use scanned dielectric objects between scattering acrylic sheets, allowing control over all relevant variables, which will enable applications including optical imaging in living subjects, such as cells and contrast agents deep within the brain, and imaging given environmental clutter. The safety, convenience, resolution, and information available from optical imaging in these applications are paramount. Of particular significance, the method will be effective for very heavy scatter, making it possible to image through substantial amounts of tissue. At a more general level, the effort relates to new opportunities for communication in a scattering environment that exploit natural motion and spatial diversity. The other aspect of the work involves use of optical measurements as a function of the precise position of a semiconductor wafer in a spatially varying optical intensity to find defects at an early stage of manufacture. This addresses a major need in industry, because there is no satisfactory method to find defects in three-dimensional devices that have become important in consumer electronics. This approach is being evaluated using example material arrangements with an introduced defect. Understanding from this aspect of the project will also be useful in other applications related to structure and material characterization.<br/> <br/>Technical: Laser optical speckle patterns as a function of object position are being used to form intensity correlations over position. This data has been shown to provide access to information about the moving object, and through a reconstruction method, to an image of the hidden object. For example, the image of a hidden aperture has been obtained. The key aspect being sought is evidence that the object's dielectric constant as a function of position can be obtained, thereby establishing the general principle of imaging in heavily scattering media. Experiments use scattering media with controlled properties and a translation stage. Information on the possible resolution is also being investigated. The other aspect of this project involves use of a model material arrangement representative of a semiconductor wafer with a defect, whereby the sample is scanned using a piezoelectric stage in an optical standing wave field created by illumination with a laser and reflection from a mirror. Detected light as a function of sample position, coupled with a model, allows the presence of a defect to be determined. The efficacy of this approach is being evaluated for application in the semiconductor wafer inspection industry. Because existing optical inspection methods are incapable of adequately detecting small defects in three-dimensional semiconductor structures, the prospect that this approach will provide a solution could address a multi-billion-dollar inspection market need."

Brief Description of Project Goals: This CAREER project investigates CMOS cellular interfacing arrays with novel pixelated multi-modality sensors/actuators and explores their use in transformative bioscience.<br/><br/><br/>3. Abstract:<br/>a) Nontechnical Abstract: Fully understanding the physiological behaviors of cells is a prerequisite to further advance the frontiers in bioscience. Existing sensors and actuators are mostly of single-modality, which can only process one single type of physical signals, e.g., electrochemical, from the cells. However, cells are highly complex systems with numerous molecules operating in hundreds of pathways to maintain proper functions and phenotypes. At this scale of complexity, cells often undergo concurrent multi-physics responses, which cannot possibly be explored by single-modality platforms. This technology constraint poses a fundamental limit on the ?communication link? between the electronics and cells/tissues. Moreover, many sensors and actuators require exotic processing steps, limiting their cost, yield, and scalability in mass production.<br/>To address these challenges, this CAREER project focuses on innovating sensor/actuator technologies as large-scaled arrays with novel pixel-level multi-modality sensing/actuation functionalities. Such microelectronics interfaces allow interrogating and stimulating living cells/tissues via multi-physics signaling at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Low-cost CMOS (Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) processes, widely used for manufacturing CPU and memory chips, will be employed to ensure high-integration, low-cost, and high-yield.<br/>The proposed CMOS multi-modality cellular interfacing platform will lead to broad societal impacts. For example, capturing the complex cellular responses may substantially increase the throughput in drug development. As another example, real-time monitoring the stem cell and enhancing the desired cell differentiation trajectories may drastically improve the purity in large-scale stem cell manufacturing and enable low-cost stem cell therapies. In addition, the cellular interfacing platform may serve as a novel research tool for new scientific discoveries.<br/>The interdisciplinary nature of this CAREER project makes it an excellent opportunity for education and outreach activities. The PI proposes a ?Vertical Teaming Approach? to systematically integrate different education components from K-12 to graduate levels. These components include mentoring high school teachers to enhance their curricula, performing remote lab demos to high school students in distance learning programs, and enriching undergraduate/graduate learning and research. The PI will also develop a Makers Electronics club at Georgia Tech to provide electronics training/innovation opportunities to local high school students and inspire their interest to pursue STEM fields. This program will be integrated with the existing NSF funded outreach programs at Georgia Tech.<br/><br/>b) Technical Abstract: <br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to investigate novel multi-modality sensor and actuator technologies to interface with complex biological systems, e.g., living cells and tissues, and explore the use of these technologies in transformative bioscience and biotechnologies.<br/>The research activities include the following key components. First, the modeling, design, and prototyping of multi-modality cellular sensor and actuator arrays will be performed. Different device-level designs and circuit-level techniques will be investigated to achieve sensor/actuator front-ends with high pixel density and low power operation. On-chip data convertors as well as on-chip signal processing/conditioning circuitries will be employed. Next, low-cost, scalable, and biocompatible packaging solutions will be studied, so that the CMOS multi-modality cellular interfacing chips can be hosted in a standard form-factor fully compatible with existing cellular assays. Finally, the PI will demonstrate the use of the CMOS multi-modality cellular interfacing platform in various cellular assays. In particular, the experiments will focus on enhancing cell-based drug/chemical screening and stem-cell culture processes.<br/>The research activities in this CAREER project will explore and establish multi-modality sensors/actuators as a new paradigm of biosensors and actuators.

No fields, forces or particles exist. However, the world we live in is not classical but controlled at the atomic scale by the rules of quantum mechanics (QM). Quantum mechanics has a number of rules and effects that defy our normal, real-world intuition. An example is the quantum mechanical vacuum. In such a vacuum, electrical and magnetic fields can and do exist albeit for short periods of time and over small length scales. One can think of the vacuum as the surface of a pond. The classical vacuum is a still pond with no waves or ripples. A boat floating on this pond never moves. However, the QM pond has waves that propagate for a short distance and then die out. These waves can move a boat on the surface. The Casimir effect is seen when one creates a set of conditions where these waves exert measurable forces on small, nanoscale objects (our boat). In classical physics, these forces should not exist but quantum mechanically they do exist and can be detected. These QM effects manifest themselves at the nanoscale and building devices and systems at this size requires that we understand them and learn how to work with them. Specifically, theoretical predictions suggest that these QM waves will change the transition temperature of a superconductor and we aim to observe this effect. Beyond interesting physics, such an effect may have implications for the existence of wormholes in space. While it is not fair to say we are looking for these, we will be doing experiments in a regime where theories by some of the world?s most eminent scientists say they may occur. We do plan to keep our eyes open.<br/><br/>Technical: We propose research that will create MEMS devices for detecting the Casimir Energy. The Casimir effect is a result of the appearance of quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic vacuum. A previous set of experiments done by a number of researchers have used MEMS parallel plate capacitors to detect the Casimir effect by measuring the small attractive force these fluctuations exert on the device. In this new set of experiments, we propose to directly detect the Casimir Energy in the vacuum modified by the presence of metallic parallel plates, a fundamentally new measurement of considerable interest to the theoretical physics community. Our approach uses a superconducting film as a sensor. The changes in the Casimir Energy within the superconductor volume is expected to shift the superconducting transition temperature because of an interaction between it and the superconducting condensation energy. The experiment we propose consists of taking a superconducting film, carefully measuring its transition temperature, bringing a conducting plate close to the film, creating a Casimir cavity, and then measuring the transition temperature again. The expected shifts will be small, ~1mK, comparable to the normal shifts one sees in cycling superconducting films to cryogenic temperatures and so using MEMS plates and doing this in situ is the only practical way to obtain accurate, reproducible data. We propose to use a MEMS device where the location of the plate can be changed while at low temperatures and look for this effect. Mechanically oscillating the MEMS plate position will modulate the effect and eliminate 1/f noise and long-term drifts from the measurement."

RF receivers are a vital component in a variety of systems that are yielding transformative benefits for society. Perhaps most prominent is wireless broadband internet connectivity. Enhancing the capacity of wireless networks will accelerate the benefits of worldwide connectivity among households, schools, hospitals, businesses, and governments. The photonic imaging receiver uses optical detection and processing of RF signals to enable unprecedented capabilities, from extremely broadband wireless communications to all-weather obscurant-penetrating imaging. Conventional RF receivers are limited by the intrinsic nonlinearity of the detection process, by which multiple signals mix and generate spurious responses. The unique capability of the imaging receiver system is the use of optics to""see"" upconverted RF signals much like the eye or a camera sees visible light: sources of RF energy within its field of view produce distinct spots on an image plane or camera sensor, whereupon these spots can be detected separately, minimizing intermixing. This approach affords advantages in speed, complexity, linearity, and also adds new capabilities such as real-time direction finding, tracking, and processing of multiple signal sources. The imaging receiver system will offer increased capacity in wireless networks, while also improving performance and reducing infrastructure cost. The same enabling technology will also provide benefits in transportation and search/rescue operations, allowing navigation in obscurants like fog, smoke, and sand. Likewise, security checkpoints will be able to screen persons and vehicles passively at a distance, enhancing both security and convenience. The research effort will investigate the limits and optimize the performance potential of such imaging receiver systems. <br/><br/>The photonic imaging receiver is a novel type of phased array receiver that uses the coherent properties of frequency upconversion in optical modulators to detect radio-frequency (RF) signals, and simple free-space optics to perform signal correlations between array elements, which are conventionally performed computationally after signals are detected and digitized. The optical upconversion process offers broad bandwidth, from UHF to millimeter-wave. Free-space optical processing enables signals coming from different sources to be spatially separated prior to detection, minimizing intermodulation and dramatically improving spur-free dynamic range (SFDR). It also provides the array gain of a phased array receiver, but with the advantage of forming all beams simultaneously. The recovery of data that has been modulated onto detected RF carriers is enabled by the use of a widely tunable optical local oscillator that is mixed with the upconverted signal on a photodiode. The foundation of the technical approach has been proven in the context of passive millimeter-wave imaging. This research program will explore the fundamental limitations of the approach in a broad and general sense, but will primarily focus on extending the utility of the approach toward ultra-wideband wireless communications, enhancing capacity by enabling spectrum reuse through spatial division multiple access. It will also investigate a novel concept in wideband systems, namely scale invariance, which seeks to replace conventional Fourier (time-frequency) domain formalism, in which the basis functions used for carrying information are continuous-wave (CW) carriers, with a new formalism based not on time-harmonic CW carriers but rather scale-invariant functions, which are naturally suited to applications with extremely broad bandwidth."

Photonic solutions are particularly suited to enable these services due to the advantages of light such as multi-terabit bandwidths, low-loss propagation over kilometers, and low cross-talk. In fact, some internet provides have begun providing service entirely through light (fiber optics). As a result, the advancement of photonic telecommunications technologies will have a profound impact upon our nation by providing improved performance of internet-based services, reduced energy consumption, and a lower cost of construction/operation for networks. Current photonic modulators, small switches which convert electrical signals into optical pulses, are limited in their speed due to the weak interaction of light and matter. More recently, metals have been utilized to enhance this interaction, facilitating a reduction of device size and increase of speed. Yet, these devices struggle to achieve efficient transmission ~10%, which is simply insufficient for many applications. Here, we look utilize the benefits of both approaches by allowing the lossy metallic nature to be engaged and disengaged when desired. This approach limits the loss of the structure while still maintaining the benefits of metal plasmonic structures. By partnering with existing programs at the home university, the research will provide avenues for local high school students, teachers, and undergraduates to learn about impact of light-based technologies on our society while providing a platform to train a highly skilled workforce. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>Despite significant research in the areas of photonic and plasmonic-based approaches, there is yet to be a device which achieves efficient all-around performance (modulation strength, insertion loss, energy consumption, size, and speed). Photonic approaches suffer from poor light-matter interactions, requiring speed restricting resonators and long interaction lengths, while plasmonic approaches have yet to overcome the large insertion loss associated with their metallic components. This proposal seeks to solve this dilemma through a new design approach in which plasmonic elements are disengaged in the off- (transmissive) state to minimize insertion loss, yet are engaged in the on-state to achieve large modulation in a short distance. This is achieved through a specifically chosen set of oxide layers which appear dielectric to the optical mode under no electrical bias, yet can be modulated into an epsilon-near-zero condition (effectively engaging the plasmonic nature) to achieve efficient modulation through free-carrier accumulation and depletion. It is shown that this approach is able to produce the first modulator design capable of efficient all-around performance: area of 3 square microns, 1.5 dB, 9dB extinction ratio, 12 fJ/bit energy consumption, and 112 GHz bandwidth. Although it is impactful for integrated systems, the approach is general and may also find applications in related areas such as metamaterials and sensors. Additionally, the realization of the device will demonstrate that plasmonic systems are not synonymous with loss and the benefits of such systems (confinement, enhanced light-matter-interaction) can be employed without detrimental loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One promising direction is utilizing atomically thin materials because of their flexibility and high electron mobility.  Graphene was the first such material identified in this new area of two-dimensional (2D) materials.  Unfortunately, graphene is not a semiconductor, but a semimetal and is therefore not suitable for the digital logic circuits widely used today in electronics.  Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of 2D materials which share many of the promising aspects of graphene such as being atomically thin.  In addition, they exhibit a wider variety of electronic and optoelectronic properties compared to graphene including many being semiconducting or metallic.  This wide range of transition metal dichalcogenides allows one to select a material or a combination of materials best suited for a particular application.  Indeed, by combining different 2D materials together in vertical heterostructures an even wider range of new device functionalities can be enabled.  This collaborative research program will create new educational and research opportunities at both the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program will strongly emphasize the training of graduate and undergraduate students from underserved groups, thus preparing them for industrial or academic careers. This workforce training, along with the expected research output, will boost the efforts to make our nation more competitive.<br/>Technical:<br/>The goal of this collaborative research program is to study layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials and heterostructures for device applications, using a combination of controlled heterostructure fabrication techniques, scanning probe microscopy, and electrical transport measurements.  Similar to graphene, the most widely studied two-dimensional material, transition metal dichalcogenides represent a larger class of layered materials with varying electronic properties, from semiconducting to superconducting. The diverse set of electronic properties in these materials makes them suitable for applications ranging from transistors to chemical sensors or photodetectors. Key to an understanding of their fundamental electronic properties is the role of the disorder potential, interfaces, and edges in individual layers, and of the band and rotational alignment in heterostructures.  Specifically, the proposed effort will (1) measure band-alignment in transition metal dichalcogenide based heterostructures, (2) realize heterostructures of two-dimensional materials with controlled rotational alignment, (3) explore the impact of rotational alignment on the electronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures, and using these ingredients (4) design and fabricate novel heterostructure tunneling devices.  This program builds on the PIs existing collaborative research and recent preliminary data on the fabrication and characterization of these heterostructures.  The outcomes of this research program will include uncovering fundamental electronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenide-based heterostructures, new methods to create heterostructures, and novel devices for future electronics applications."

These blooms have become a major concern when it comes to water safety and management as they can have severe impacts on public health, aquatic ecosystems, and local economies. Current methods for toxin detection include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction, high performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. These methods require complex operation, fluorophore labeling, sophisticated and bulk instruments, and skilled personnel. Additionally, these methods take days for analysis, cannot be easily performed in the field, and cannot determine multiple toxins at the same time. Therefore simple and low cost detection technologies that can meet this challenge are critically needed in recognition of the importance of water quality monitoring and environmental protection. The development of novel sensors for detection of toxins in water can revolutionize our understanding of aquatic ecosystem functions governing water quality at the watershed scale.   For example, it can be accomplished, in part, by assembling a portfolio of novel sensors for on-site real time multiplexing monitoring of the biotic and abiotic compartments within the water cycle.  The pervasive networking of these sensors will enable process monitoring at spatial and temporal scales that are much higher than is currently feasible.   Integrating these data streams into simulation models of the water cycle will deepen our understanding of these processes, facilitate the development of real-time indices to forecast events such as algal blooms, and identify strategies that can be followed to avert such events. The outcome of the research will be integrated in the outreach activities include working with industry for validation, field testing in Lake Erie, publicizing the technology through annual ""Media Day"" at OSU Stone Lab, ""Nanobiotechnology Summer Camp"" and ""Adopting a Class"" from local school students. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop GaN (gallium nitride) based immunologically field effect transistors biosensors for detection of extracellular and intracellular cyanotoxins in water and environmental samples. The proposed devices are capable of label-free multiplexing detection rapidly (in minutes) by both immuno-sensing and nucleic acid detection as necessary. These sensor devices can be fabricated in a large array system with each device using distinct antibodies, so that a full profile of contaminants can be achieved by a single low cost test. Due to the fact that these devices can be fabricated at very small sizes and monitored at the individual device level, each sensing array can detect potential toxins at extremely low concentrations.  Although this kind of biosensors have been demonstrated for other biosensing applications, their application to cyanotoxin detection and monitoring has yet to be demonstrated. The team choses AlGaN (aluminum gallium nitride)/GaN heterojunction semiconductor structures as the device platform because this material system is chemically inert and stable so a high signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved. The proposed toxin sensors can meet the following  requirements: (1) high sensitivity or low detection limit and large dynamic range; (2) high specificity and multiplexing detection; (3) rapid detection and short analysis time; (4) label free; and (5) field-portability and easy-of-use, capable of detection of both extracellular and intracellular toxins, and forming a sensing network for long term environmental monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been the source of low-cost, efficient, and high-speed electronics for numerous applications. This trend, however, is about to slow down or even stop in the next few years due to several limitations. This is particularly consequential for high-speed and high-power electronics as they become extremely challenging to implement due to the technology limitations. For example, millimeter wave (mm-wave) and terahertz (THz) systems are known to have unique and significant applications in health, security and industry. Detection of concealed weapons, cancer diagnosis, high-resolution radar, medical imaging, 3D imaging, and semiconductor wafer/device inspection, along with bio/molecular spectroscopy for drug detection, food quality control, and breath analyses for disease diagnosis are among many examples of these applications. In particular remote sensing, active/passive imaging and short-range communication are continually evolving at a rapid pace toward mm-wave and THz frequencies in order to achieve superior resolution and higher data rate. Today, however, THz systems are realized using expensive and bulky devices such as gas lasers and discrete bulky components. If compact and on-chip THz systems are realized the numerous related applications will rapidly flourish, resulting in new opportunities in high-tech marketplace and research and teaching institutions. Today's solid-state technologies including silicon and compound semiconductors can barley cover the lower part of the THz band with useful amount of radiated power. Moreover, phased arrays are essential in some of these applications to boost and localize the radiated power. Phase shifters are critical in a conventional phased array system but they are extremely lossy at high frequencies. The complications of integrating these phase shifters and a stable signal in phased array systems have prevented designers to implement THz high power transmitters on chip. To overcome these problems the PI introduces fundamentally new approaches to design harmonic voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO), radiator array and phased array systems at THz and mm-wave frequencies. The PI's research plan is to use these approaches to make solid-state electronics the default platform for high-performance on-chip THz systems, which are hard to envision today.<br/><br/>First the PI introduces novel array structures based on the unique properties of traveling and standing waves that enable efficient and high power signal generation and radiation. The important properties of these structures are as follows: 1- they greatly simplify the structure of the array and result in high radiated power and high DC to RF efficiency, 2- no additional global or local routing is needed other than the ones that belong to the oscillator structure, thereby making this architecture inherently scalable to larger array sizes for both the radiator and the phased array, 3- when used in the phased array they completely eliminate the need of phase shifters anywhere in the structure, and 4- only one high frequency divider is needed to sense the fundamental frequency and lock the whole array in a frequency synthesizer, resulting in a low power operation. Next, the PI uses the ""Optimum Signal Condition"" methodology and introduces a new technique to shape the transistor signals and boost the harmonic power in oscillators. Combining the scalable array structures with the signal shaping technique the PI proposes VCOs, radiator arrays and phased arrays that have significantly higher performances than the state of the art. The PI believes the proposed radiator and phased array would be the cornerstone of future phased array systems for radar, sensor and communication applications at THz and mm-wave frequencies."

Unfortunately, many power system analysis tools do not use algorithms that implement state-of-the-art solution techniques due to the time lag of results percolating from one field to another.  Therefore, there is a need to bring together the best of the mathematicians, computer scientists, and power engineers to solve realistic problems.  In this project, computationally efficient solution methods will be synergistically developed and applied to the problem of achieving real-time power system simulation.  Specifically, recent advances in computational science and theoretical computer science will be extended to the problem of electric power networks.  <br/>Intellectual Merit:  Real-time simulation has long been considered to be a grand challenge in electric power engineering.   A realistically sized electric power network problem can generate hundreds of dynamic state variables and 50,000+ algebraic states.  The computational complexity of some power system simulations has kept time domain simulation from being used in on-line decision making. If simulations could run in real-time, then power system operators would have situational awareness and could implement on-line control to avoid cascading failures. This tool will assist the operator with proactive measures to limit the extent of the incident, and can significantly improve power system reliability.  This project will exploit the expertise and advances in areas of linear solvers from a variety of physical fields and will adapt them for use in power system simulation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:  This project will provide an opportunity for educating a diverse STEM workforce in electric power systems, computer algorithms and applied mathematics.  The PIs, the graduate students, and the post-doctoral fellow will enter into a close mentoring relationship that will include one-on-one instruction not only in computational methods, but also ethical research practices, communication skills, and international awareness.  The results of this research will be incorporated into multiple graduate classes: Computational Methods for Power Systems andApproximation Algorithms.

To achieve this objective, silicon bowtie photonic crystals with extreme energy density will be utilized to provide a platform by which properties of single particles can be monitored in a straightforward manner. Guided by simulations, this project will utilize relatively low input power to measure (1) the phase change properties of a single grain vanadium dioxide nanoparticle and (2) emission from a single quantum dot on a silicon chip.

Though detailed understanding of thermal emission dates back over a century, recent advances have encouraged the re-examination of this phenomenon and its potential applications. This project will explore ways to utilize and engineer thermal emission for applications such as passively regulating temperatures without using external power or feedback loops, coatings that camouflage objects from infrared cameras, and improved temperature measurements at a distance. The design and implementation of thermal emitters and thermal-emission measurement schemes will involve computational design, collaboration with materials scientists, micro- and nanofabrication, and table-top optical experiments. Students working on this project will thus gain experience in all parts of the engineering process, and develop analytical, experimental, and communication skills. This project will closely integrate the research, teaching, and outreach missions, with the aims of improving undergraduate and graduate education, communicating science to the public, and increasing participation in science from students at all levels. The principal investigator will incorporate timely research findings into his advanced optics and photonics courses, which will be redesigned using a hybrid model combining lectures and a flipped classroom approach. The project will aim to expand the recruitment of students from groups underrepresented in science and technology programs via targeted recruiting into summer and graduate programs. To promote science communication, the principal investigator and his group will also launch a podcast focused on topics in applied physics, technology, and the practice of science. <br/><br/>Conventional wisdom grounded in the century-old Planck and Stefan-Boltzmann laws holds that thermally emitted light is broadband, unpolarized, non-directional, and becomes brighter with rising temperature. Over the last fifteen years, a number of groups have shown that it is possible to engineer the spectrum, directionality, and polarization of thermal emitters, enabling applications such as thermo-photovoltaics and high-efficiency incandescent light sources. However, other engineering degrees of freedom of thermal emitters have scarcely been explored, including temperature dependence in the emissivity, temperature non-uniformity, and wavefront selectivity. This project will explore these degrees of freedom and their applications to thermoregulation, infrared privacy, and metrology. Phase-transition materials will be used to realize thermal emitters with temperature-dependent emissivity, utilizing thin-film optical design and nanoscale defect engineering to maximize the design space. One set of emitters will enable passive regulation of temperature in systems where radiative heat transfer dominates, such as components of spacecraft or high-temperature power plants. Complementary emitter designs will enable cloaking of objects from infrared cameras, masking temperature profiles.

Finally, thermal emitters will be demonstrated that can directly generate a variety of complex optical wavefronts, including optical vortices and radially polarized beams."

Such a laser can be made of optical fiber, which is attractive because the light is automatically kept inside the fiber. In fibers used for this purpose to date, the core of the fiber is very small (a few millionths of a meter) and only a single mode, or pattern, of the light propagates in the fiber. This mode is what most people associate with a laser beam: a small spot that is brightest in its center. <br/>If the core of the fiber is made larger, other patterns can propagate. All of the allowed patterns overlap, so the beam that comes out is a complicated mix of them.  The light field varies in space and in time as it propagates in the fiber. Lasers based on multiple patterns can theoretically reach much higher powers, which are needed for applications, but the patterns must be controlled. Control of the patterns will also allow new capabilities, such as the generation of short light pulses at new wavelengths (colors, including infrared and ultraviolet).  <br/>Advances in theoretical understanding and experimental techniques in the last few years now give researchers the tools to develop lasers based on fibers with many overlapping patterns or modes. Groups from Cornell University and the University of Central Florida will work to develop lasers and other sources of short light pulses based on such fibers.  <br/>Graduate students who work on this project will receive theoretical and practical training, and will be prepared for diverse careers in science and technology. In an effort to increase exposure of science and enhance diversity of participants, the Cornell group will work with the 4H organization to offer workshops aimed at exposing junior-high-school students to science and possible careers.  <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>A group from Cornell University will perform theoretical and experimental studies of the propagation of ultrashort light pulses in optical fibers that support many transverse modes of the electromagnetic field. As a result of recent advances in understanding of multimode pulse propagation, which is inherently spatiotemporal in nature, it is now feasible to begin to design sources of ultrashort light pulses based on multimode fiber. High-power lasers, and sources of broadly-tunable intense infrared pulses will be constructed and studied. Collaborators from the University of Central Florida will provide computational support.<br/>The field of ultrafast science has been built largely with short-pulse lasers based on a single transverse mode of a cavity, or optical fibers that support a single transverse mode. Exploitation of spatiotemporal wave propagation for the design of new sources of ultrashort pulses has not been considered previously. The new pulse-shaping mechanisms that will be investigated offer enhanced or completely-new capabilities for high-energy and ultrashort pulses. <br/>Optical fiber offers an ideal setting to study new nonlinear waves. Knowledge gained in the proposed effort will be pertinent to future telecommunications systems based on mode-division multiplexing. The nonlinear dynamics investigated in this project will correspond to related effects in a variety of systems, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, and multimode propagation will be relevant to optical studies of turbulence."

Overall, OECTs will open new ways to study and monitor common diseases, which can lead to an improvement of the health and quality of life of people in the US and around the world.<br/>However, despite the intense interest in OECTs, the understanding of their working mechanism is incomplete. Models used to describe OECTs split the device in two separate parts - one part describing ionic conduction inside the gate electrolyte, and a second part describing the electronic conduction inside the organic semiconductor. This artificial separation between ionic and electronic currents leads to inconsistencies in the description of the device operation, which have to be resolved in order to increase the performance of OECTs. <br/>In its research component, the project aims at enhancing the understanding of the working mechanisms of OECTs.

To achieve this goal, the development of systems comprising many coupled quantum bits (qubits) with the ability to perform storage, communication and multi-qubit logic operations is essential. Atomic-scale luminescent defects - color centers - in diamond have recently emerged as a leading solid-state platform that has many of these characteristics. However, approaches to efficiently couple different color centers using light have been limited by a photon loss. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with confining light to a sub-micron volume on a diamond chip. The proposed program will explore an alternative approach to qubit coupling that relies on mechanical vibrations, and will thus enable a new generation of capabilities for the field of quantum science and technology, with applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. The program addresses topics related to quantum engineering, quantum information science, nanofabrication, material science, nanophotonics and nanomechanics and has strong theoretical and experimental component. Therefore, it represents a unique research and educational opportunity for students at all levels.  <br/><br/>Part 2: Atomic-scale luminescent defects in diamond have recently emerged as a leading solid-state platform for realization of on-chip quantum networks. Of particular importance are negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers that possess all the essential elements for quantum technology: storage, control and read-out. While the NV remains the best solid state quantum memory, recent work has shown that SiV is superior quantum emitter with spectrally stable and atomic-like emission. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that SiV properties can be engineered by applying strain, induced by mechanical motion. In this program, strong spin-strain coupling in SiV will be leveraged to realize quantum networks that utilize acoustic phonons as information carriers in on-chip quantum networks. For example, by embedding SiVs inside phononic cavities and waveguides, it will be possible to engineer spin-phonon interactions and achieve controlled phonon emission and absorption by SiVs, as well as phonon routing, storage, and phonon-phonon interactions (phonon switches). This will enable realization of two-qubit quantum gates based on SiVs embedded inside mechanical resonators, in which qubit entanglement is mediated by mechanical vibration. On the other hand, by surrounding SiV with a phononic bandgap structures, phonon emission process will be suppressed thus enhancing the SiV spin coherence time by several orders of magnitude. The proposed program will pave the way for a new field of quantum acousto dyanmics that uses phonons, and mechanical vibration in general, as on-chip information carriers. Importantly, since mechanical vibrations can be engineered to couple coherently to many different qubits (spin, charge, flux, photon), proposed efforts may enable transfer of quantum states between different degrees of freedom, and lead to realization of hybrid quantum networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It addresses a grand challenge of 21st-century science: leveraging modern capabilities in materials science, nanofabrication, signal processing, and integrated systems-on-a-chip to harness the computational power and sensitivity of quantum-coherent systems for practical applications. Motivated by the clear potential of spin-based quantum devices, this RAISE-EQuIP project adopts an engineering approach to address a series of technological roadblocks that currently limit their performance and scalability. The interdisciplinary approach harnesses state-of-the-art classical and quantum signal processing, electronic circuit design in silicon-based integrated platforms, machine learning optimization, and nanophotonic design, with the aim to transform spin-based quantum registers from a laboratory-scale experiments into compact, integrated systems that are available to power new applications and scientific investigations. With superior performance offered under real-world constraints, these devices can be deployed in testbed quantum communication networks and will enable future investigations of fundamental quantum physics. The collaborative project will engage many undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds; its research goals are coupled with a broad educational mission to educate students and the public about the emerging field of quantum science and technology. Through the realization of compact, robust, low-cost quantum devices, this project will support the design and deployment of hands-on activities for K-12 students and the public about spins, photons, and quantum communication, for use at venues that target large, diverse populations in Philadelphia, PA and Providence, RI.<br/><br/>Clusters of nuclear spins coupled to an optically addressable electron-spin qubit such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading platforms for quantum communication.

However, state-of-the-art experiments are currently performed on laboratory-scale setups consisting of customized optical cryostats, vibration-sensitive free-space optics, and racks of microwave electronics. Performance is further impeded by sub-optimal photon collection efficiency and labor-intensive calibration requirements for quantum control sequences. This RAISE-EQuIP project will tackle these challenges on multiple levels, drawing on complementary expertise of the collaborating researchers in diamond NV quantum control and device engineering (Bassett), high-speed analog circuit design and signal processing (Aflatouni), and computational physics and nanophotonics (Zia). We will design and build compact, fiber-coupled diamond devices featuring nanofabricated optical metalenses and impedance-matched microwave antennas to transmit optical and spin-resonance signals, respectively, and integrate these devices with custom-fabricated silicon CMOS chips that process the necessary analog and digital signals for spin resonance, photon counting, and real-time adaptive feedback control. Computational machine learning methods will enable efficient mapping and control of the unknown coupled-spin Hamiltonian. The resulting quantum-register devices will exhibit performance superior to state-of-the-art laboratory systems, but with a fraction of the size, cost, and energy requirements. Components of the modular, hybrid-integrated system are generalizable to other quantum architectures based on spins, ions, photons, and superconducting qubits, so these devices can serve as a framework for future generations of portable quantum technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A very well-known application of photodetectors is an imaging sensor of a digital camera. Compared with the well-established photo-detection methods of visible light, the sensing of near- and mid-infrared light with high sensitivity at room temperature is still challenging. An advanced infrared light photodetector requires cooling of the device below -100oC. Conversion of infrared light-heat-electric signal is a useful way to detect IR light. However, this approach (called as a thermoelectric effect) has several inherent problems which prevent a miniaturization of the device and limit an ability to resolve infrared light with different wavelengths. Also, existing thermoelectric materials exhibit a low efficiency in converting light energy to electric energy at room temperature. It is difficult to address weaknesses of current technology by improving only a single aspect of devices. In this project, multidisciplinary research will be performed for new materials design, theoretical performance evaluation and novel electric device fabrication. The photodetector from this project will efficiently collect infrared light of different wavelengths at room temperature. The nature of the multidisciplinary research will be beneficial in integrating the technical research with education and outreach.

This will be accomplished using hybrid structures of 2-dimensional materials, such as graphene and molybdenum sulfide, and plasmonic metal Nano-shells. The hypotheses underlying the proposed structure are as follows. First, unlike conventional bulk thermoelectric materials, graphene and molybdenum Nano sheets have an extremely large surface area to volume ratio. This feature can provide an opportunity to improve the Seebeck coefficient through modifying or doping the surface. Second, high and wavelength-dependent absorption of infrared light can be enabled by the surface plasmons of dielectric core - metal Nano-shell particles with tunable characteristic wavelengths. Third, a thin free-standing silicon nitride membrane with low heat capacity and low thermal conductivity can allow faster and larger increase of local temperature upon IR light absorption. This will improve dynamic response and the signal-to-noise ratio of an IR sensor. The low thermal conductivity of silicon nitride can be further reduced by increasing structural and mass disorder. The major intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the fundamental understanding of the heat and charge transport properties at nanoscale. Through integrated research of simulation and experiment, the principal investigators will develop a model to predict how physical properties (e.g. Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of a free standing membrane affect important performance factors of the thermoelectric IR sensor, such as output signal, response time and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, enhancement of selective light absorption by the metal Nano-shells and subsequent energy dissipation will show a novel way to resolve the wavelength of incident infrared light and create a temperature gradient through local heating."

The performance of these technologies is reaching fundamental limits, so quantum machines are expected to drive the next technological revolution. These machines process information by manipulating the most fundamental properties of atoms and photons, their quantum states. Applications include absolutely secure communications over the Internet, the capability to quickly solve problems like protein folding for drug discovery, and quantum simulation of new materials with extreme properties. Analogous to the current Internet, optical quantum networks will be used to interconnect quantum machines. Quantum networks consist of optical channels where photons travel and nodes where photons are generated, stored and processed using quantum light-matter interfaces. The goal of this research is to develop on-chip light-matter interfaces for storing photons and their quantum states. Depending on the application, the interface could act as a memory where the quantum state is retrieved back into a photon, or the state could be transferred to another quantum device.

The experimental approach merges new nano-fabrication techniques for rare-earth-doped crystals (neodymium doped yttrium orthosilicate), high-resolution laser spectroscopy, and coherent control of atomic quantum states. As a result of this research, the feasibility of developing integrated nanophotonic quantum devices based on rare-earth-doped crystals will be assessed. The optical coherence, the spectral stability and the spin coherence of rare-earth ions embedded in a nano-scale environment will be studied, and techniques for coherent control of their quantum states in on-chip photonic networks will be developed.

One of the most important building blocks to realize a quantum-enabled network information infrastructure that is capable of generating and distributing entanglement at high rates over long distances is the quantum repeater a quantum enabled processor that will sit at the node of the future quantum internet, augmenting the current-day network router. Our project?s goal is to research, develop and test a design for the quantum repeater, which will be realized compactly in an integrated photonic platform that produces complex many-photon entangled states on demand. The successful completion of this project will enable various applications of shared entanglement, including future-proof secure communications and multi-party secure computations, entanglement-assisted distributed sensors for far superior imaging and remote sensing, and will enable new science discoveries in areas such as chemistry and high-energy physics by letting us experiment with entangled states larger than any created so far.

Our project?s goal is to research and develop a design of a quantum repeater that does not need quantum memories or quantum interconversion, but uses an integrated photonic source of locally-generated complex entangled states of many photonic modes to replace the action of the quantum memory by providing virtual storage of a logical quantum bit (qubit) using quantum error correction against photon loss.

Our key insight is to develop an alternative scheme that leverages recently-demonstrated photonic multi-mode-squeezed entangled states of thousands of modes as the cluster source, but built compactly on a hybrid Aluminum Nitride - Silicon photonic platform, and use photon number detection on a subset of those modes to cast that into a universal-quantum-capable coded cluster state and develop a new logical qubit encoding into that ""non-Gaussian"" cluster state in a so-called Schrodinger-cat-like qubit basis. The goals of this project are: (1) establishing the theoretical design principles of a technologically-feasible all-photonic quantum repeater based on a continuous-variable (CV) entangled cluster source, (2) developing a compact, versatile integrated nanophotonic platform for generating and manipulating CV cluster states, (3) realizing direct on-demand generation of non-Gaussian universal clusters at high rates, and (4) the first measurement of entanglement distribution over one quantum repeater link that exceeds the fundamental direct-transmission rate upper limit for entanglement generation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, nanoscale science and engineering often requires the use of complex and expensive tools and facilities for the fabrication and characterization of these materials and devices. This necessitates the support of shared national resources for both basic research in academic institutions and the translation of these discoveries into commercial products by small and large enterprises. As part of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) program, the Southeastern Nanotechnology Infrastructure Corridor (SENIC) will create a partnership between the Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology at the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, an academic collaboration between North Carolina A&T State University (NCA&T) and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). This national resource will provide open access to nanofabrication and characterization facilities and tools along with expert staff support to a growing user community across the southeastern U.S. The SENIC infrastructure will strengthen and accelerate discovery in nanoscience and nanoengineering, benefiting both traditional disciplines, such as electronics and materials, as well as newer areas, such as biomedical and environmental sciences. In addition, because societal and economic need requires a skilled workforce trained in the tools and techniques of nanotechnology, SENIC will implement a comprehensive education and outreach program, embedded with lessons in socially and ethically responsible development and use of nanotechnology, designed to reach a broad and diverse audience of students, teachers and the public.<br/><br/>With access to more than 230 nanotechnology fabrication and characterization tools, SENIC's goal is to provide a one-stop-shop approach, covering both top-down approaches using nanoscale patterning, as well as bottom-up approaches based on nanomaterials synthesis and additive processing. A particular strength of the partnership is the ability to connect nanomaterials and devices to full packaged systems. This helps transition nanoscale research achievements more quickly into high-impact applications in biomedical/health, energy, communication, smart transportation, textiles and smart agriculture. SENIC will operate with an interdisciplinary culture where engineers, scientists, physicians, educators, policy experts, and economic development professionals work together with shared access to facilities and tools and a deep understanding of industry opportunities and societal challenges to promote the accelerated translation of invention into innovation. Furthermore, the SENIC partners will work with undergraduate and graduate students, as well as partner with 2-year technical colleges, to produce science and engineering professionals from diverse backgrounds who are ready to meet the global workforce demands of the 21st century. In tandem, the public outreach with hands-on classroom activities as well as interactive facility tours will encourage K-12 students to participate in the STEM pipeline and will help create an informed citizenry that supports the safe development of nanotechnology. Closely coupled with its education program, SENIC will have a social and ethical implications program that educates on the challenges associated with the expectations that nanoscale science and engineering will contribute to the solution of societal, environmental, and economic problems, while anticipating and avoiding potential negative consequences."

From remote assessment of powders on the ground to optical biomedical imaging, there is a need to evaluate the chemical composition of materials a turbid medium. Vibrational spectroscopy has proven to be successful in identifying chemicals in complex medium. However, the strength of the signal is often considered as a major limitation. The proposed research program aims at overcoming those major disadvantages by utilizing a recently discovered effect of stimulated Raman emission in disordered medium. It allows increasing the signal by an astonishing value of 106-109 making it possible simple and seamless remote chemical sensing of powders km's away from the target. The proposed program will have a profound effect on environmental science, biomedical science and medical diagnostic imaging, and homeland security. The novel operating principle of the proposed device and technology and methods, which will be used in the device design and construction, will positively affect a number of research and application areas where light scattering effects are important. Just a single impending application of biomedical imaging device utilizing stimulated Raman scattering enhancement in randomly scattering tissues can potentially affect the lives of more than a billion people by providing a simple access to the chemical composition of deep-laying tissues. From the educational standpoint, proposed program will provide unmatched opportunities for training and professional development of the students directly involved in the research, significantly advancing their future career prospects. In particular, the program will expose the students to the ""full cycle"" of multidisciplinary research, from computational simulations to sample preparation and characterization, from initial formulation of analytical description of the observed phenomena to the follow-up iterative instrument optimization, from a fundamental idea to a real-life practical application. From the outreach perspective, the program presents several thrusts aimed at school-aged students and their teachers. Texas A&M University is located in the middle of the fastest growing, predominantly Hispanic-populated region in the US, and several activities will be specifically targeting the diverse student population.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The proposed program builds up on the recent advances in computational science, engineering, optical sciences and chemistry to introduce a transformative approach for remote sensing and biomedical imaging through scattering medium. The proposed program is built on those preliminary results and has a major research objective of fundamental understanding the mechanisms and limitations of efficient nonlinear optical interactions in random media. To accomplish this goal, we will: <br/>(1)Fundamentally understand the mechanism, conditions and limitations of stimulated Raman scattering in random media. We will use both the developed computational and experimental tools to investigate the effects of absorption and scattering parameters of the media, the effects of inhomogeneities and inclusions, as well as a broad range of excitation parameters, such as wavelength, pulse duration and beam shape, on the threshold and efficiency of stimulated Raman scattering in random media.<br/>(2)Explore the possibility of controlling random Raman lasing using temporally and spatially shaped laser pulses. In many practical situations, random media does not vary appreciably over time. It creates an opportunity to optimize the wavefront of the incident radiation to enhance the nonlinear interaction inside the medium.<br/>(3)Utilize the developed concept of random Raman lasing for remote sensing and deep tissue biological imaging. We will use the results of Aims 1-2 to design a practical system for remote chemical sensing and deep tissue biological imaging."

Over 99% of all the electricity on the planet originates from an electric generator regardless of how it is spun (wind, coal, nuclear, etc.) and roughly 2/3 of that energy goes on to power electric motors. There is a worldwide market of $73.2 billion annually for electric machines.  As electric energy consumption steadily increases annually, these ubiquitous workhorses continue to be mass-produced for performing the pumping, heating, cooling, drilling, pressing, cutting, grinding, and moving that occurs every minute of every day.  Traditional electric motors rely on magnetism to function, and are made of steel, copper wire windings, and permanent magnets.  These materials are mostly sourced from abroad, especially copper for the windings and rare earth elements for the magnets.  These elements are expensive and have a volatile market. This project focuses on overcoming technical barriers in order to create motors that use electric fields, rather than magnetism, to operate.  Electric fields would allow other materials, e.g. aluminum and plastic, to be used which are lighter weight and lower cost than materials for magnetism based motors.  These materials could be domestically sourced, in addition to being more easily recycled. <br/><br/>The educational aspects of the project are focused on increasing the scientific and engineering literacy of pre-college and college students as well as the general public.  Hands-on science and engineering demonstrations for pre-college students will stimulate STEM education and entice students to pursue STEM fields in their careers. College courses will be reworked to allow students to gain skills as effective researchers. Science Cafs held for the general public will serve as grass roots discussions on relevant energy science and engineering topics to increase science literacy in the general public.  <br/><br/>Motors utilizing an electric field as the torque-producing mechanism (E-field Motors) can have significant materials, manufacturing, and operational advantages over their magnetic counterparts. To realize the potential of E-field machines the project will develop analytical E-field machine models encompassing electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and dielectric materials to form a multiphysics analytical model/methodology for E-field machine development. These models will be applied to reduce the mechanical gap between rotors and stators of the E-field motor via hydrodynamic bearing action with a dielectric fluid. The gap reduction will drive up the operational electric field and electrostatic shear stress simultaneously.  This approach will be validated by multiphysics finite element simulations, bench scale experiments and E-field machine prototypes based on the multiphysics analytical design. Performance of the prototypes will be compared to traditional magnetism based motor designs. By exceeding the performance of magnetic motors, the project will transform the life cycle of electric motors by making them more recyclable through reducing the raw materials they require.  Since E-field systems use electric fields to produce torque, rare earth magnets and silicon steel would no longer be required, and copper could be be replaced with aluminum."

Relatively recent advances such as the personal computer, the World Wide Web, the cell phone, high definition television, the forth-coming autonomous car and artificial intelligence, all have roots in government funded research and development. The meteoric growth in these areas has been made possible by the rapid advances in semiconductor capability for both electronics and photonics. To access new areas for growth, there is now a need to develop flexible, faster, thinner, and more power efficient semiconductor materials with new capability. This aim has led to the so-called van der Waals bonded materials, which are materials that can be peeled, layer by layer, down to the thickness of a single 2-dimensional (2D) atomic layer. Such materials promise high speed, greater power efficiency, flexibility, and novel electro-optic properties not found in materials utilized thus far. Thus, this research aims to study their material properties with a view towards applications. <br/>The research is to be carried out in the Physics & Astronomy Department of Georgia State University [GSU], one of the most diverse universities in the nation. The undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) educational component of this proposal aims to translate the abilities of general university students from historically underrepresented groups and women in STEM fields, into the pursuit of a career path in a STEM field, by providing them early exposure to a supportive, confidence building, research experience through mini-science projects in the 2D materials area. Such education/training provided in a southern urban inner-city academic institution in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, will help to add underrepresented sections of society to the nation's science and technology skill base for the electronics, photonics, defense, and wireless communications industries. <br/>Technical Description:<br/>Single atomic layers of bulk van der Waals bonded crystals, and stacks built up by van der Waals epitaxy including a number of single atomic layers with differing electronic, optical, spin, and superconducting properties, offer the possibility of obtaining new physical properties not available in existing bulk materials' properties that can be utilized to address outstanding technological problems in low power and flexible electronics, sensing, and photonics. Thus, this research will experimentally examine the magneto-optoelectronic response under steady state photo-excitation of 2D atomic-layered materials including mono-layer and bilayer graphene, atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), mono- and bilayer-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and other transition metal-dichalcogenides. A research team consisting of graduate students and a postdoc, with help from undergraduates participating in mini science projects, will build up 2D atomic-layered crystals by van der Waals epitaxy; fabricate devices by electron beam lithography, plasma etch, and metallization; and examine the properties of electrically contacted and non-contacted devices in the presence of a magnetic field under microwave, mm-wave, and terahertz photo-excitation. Here, some specific problems of interest include the mm-wave magneto-response of graphene, the electric field effect on photoresponse in h-BN encapsulated graphene and MoS2, and the study of the spin properties in graphene across the neutrality point. Such studies are expected to provide insight into the electronic structure of 2D materials, their photo response, spin-g-factors, spin lifetimes, and the dependence of induced bandgaps on applied electric and magnetic fields - attributes that would identify the suitability of such systems for various desirable applications.  Potentially transformative results could include the observation of novel radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations in graphene, the realization and measurement of long spin lifetimes in h-BN encapsulated graphene, and the measurement of bandgaps in electric field biased bilayer h-BN encapsulated graphene or MoS2 or other transition metal dichalcogenides in the small bandgap limit."

Soft nanostructures are typically polymeric, biological and fluidic in nature while hybrid represents systems comprising soft-hard interfaces. SHyNE facilities enable broad access to an extensive fabrication, characterization and computational infrastructure with a multi-faceted and interdisciplinary approach for transformative science and enabling technologies. In addition to traditional micro/nanofabrication tools, SHyNE provides specialized capabilities for soft materials and soft-hard hybrid nano-systems. SHyNE enhances regional capabilities by providing users with on-site and remote open-access to state-of-the-art laboratories and world-class technical expertise to help solve the challenging problems in nanotechnology research and development for non-traditional areas such as the agricultural, biomedical, chemical, food, geological and environmental, among other industries. A critical component of the SHyNE mission is scholarly outreach through secondary and post-secondary research experience and integration with curricula at both universities, as well as, societal outreach through a novel nano-journalism project in collaboration with the Medill School of Journalism. SHyNE promotes active participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, in sciences and utilizes Chicago's public museums for broader outreach. SHyNE leverages an exceptional depth of intellectual, academic and facilities resources to provide critical infrastructure in support of research, application development and problem-solving in nanoscience and nanotechnology and integrates this transformative approach into the societal fabric of Chicago and the greater Midwest.<br/><br/>SHyNE is a solution-focused, open-access collaborative initiative operating under the umbrella of NU's International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN), in partnership with UC's Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME).  SHyNE open-access user facilities bring together broad experience and capabilities in traditional soft nanomaterials such as biological, polymeric or fluidic systems and hybrid systems combining soft/hard materials and interfaces. Collectively, soft and hybrid nanostructures represent remarkable scientific and technological opportunities. However, given the sub-100nm length-scale and related complexities, advanced facilities are needed to harness their full potential. Such facilities require capabilities to pattern soft/hybrid nanostructures across large areas and tools/techniques to characterize them in their pristine states. These divergent yet integrated needs are met by SHyNE, as it coordinates NU's extensive cryo-bio, characterization and soft-nanopatterning capabilities with the state-of-the-art cleanroom fabrication and expertise at UC's Pritzker Nanofabrication Facility (PNF). SHyNE addresses emerging needs in synthesis/assembly of soft/biological structures and integration of classical clean-room capabilities with soft-biological structures, providing expertise and instrumentation related to the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides and peptide-based materials. SHyNE coordinates with Argonne National Lab facilities and leverages existing super-computing and engineering expertise under Center for Hierarchical Materials Design (CHiMaD) and Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII), respectively. An extensive array of innovative educational, industry and societal outreach, such as nano-journalism, industry-focused workshop/symposia and collaborations with Chicago area museums, provide for an integrated and comprehensive coverage of modern infrastructure for soft/hybrid systems for the next generation researchers and the broader society."

In fact, the cost of providing clean power from solar cells has been cut in half in only 6 years, and consequently, the number of jobs in the industry has skyrocketed.  This project focuses on developing next generation solar cell technologies through new designs and manufacturing techniques that will reduce costs further while increasing overall performance.  Since solar panel technology has yet to reach maturity, tremendous benefits for society are possible if recently identified engineering and science hurdles can be overcome. A key goal is to implement new materials, manufacturing processes, and characterization tools to enhance the fraction of incident sunlight that is converted to electrical power.  Current commercial solar panel designs use a single absorbing semiconductor layer in the device that allows a theoretical maximum of only ~30% conversion of the power in sunlight to electricity.  To date, approximately two-thirds of this maximum has been reached.  Next generation concepts involve the use of two absorbing semiconducting layers in the so-called ""tandem"" device structure which will allow a theoretical maximum of ~45% conversion of the incident sunlight to electrical power.  Although high efficiency tandems have been fabricated from high cost materials for use in space power, the cost of these cells is too high for large-scale terrestrial use.  This project will use a novel strategy that enables dissimilar semiconductor materials to work together and promotes low-cost production technologies of the resulting high efficiency tandem solar cells.  Importantly, the approach we will use ensures that the developed devices will be amenable to high-volume manufacturing.  The project integrates educational opportunities for students as well as outreach efforts to stakeholders, both designed to increase diversity in our science and engineering workforce and to broaden the impact of this project.<br/><br/>The technical description<br/><br/>In this project a new general approach will be developed for fabricating monolithic tandems from dissimilar materials, based on the capabilities of novel solution processable single-wall carbon nanotube tunnel junctions.   This approach will create avenues for unlocking the mass production potential of high efficiency, low cost monolithically integrated tandem solar cells for terrestrial use.  The general research plan is expected to lead to tandems with a PCE > 30%.  The research program leverages existing high efficiency CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) devices produced by vacuum co-evaporation and capabilities for producing high efficiency CIGS and perovskite devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 by solution processing in a move toward an all-solution processed monolithically integrated tandem that can be fabricated in one continuous, low-cost manufacturing process.  As an integral part of the research, analysis will be performed via spectroscopic ellipsometry and laser beam-induced voltage and current response measurements that will guide the synthesis work.  These tools will enable in-depth simulations for understanding of tandem cell performance and will expedite adjustment of the band-gap ratios and layer thicknesses to insure optimal collection and current matching between cells."

These devices will have the potential to transform healthcare, enabling tele-monitoring and remote/autonomous drug delivery  and facilitating environmental monitoring in agriculture and cyber-defense where connecting biological phenomena with electronics are important. The technical underpinnings of this work recognize that microelectronic devices depend on electrons for information processing while biology depends on molecules (e.g., insulin, antibodies). These systems are not intrinsically compatible as there are no free electrons in biology that could be transmitted to biological wires and control cell-based electronic circuits. Instead, biohybrid devices are envisioned that transmit information across this electron-molecule divide. New interfaces are needed that accept molecules from biology and create electrons for devices and the reverse. Such integrated systems designed and constructed within RE-BIONICS will be capable of this bidirectional communication for memory and computation. The project will build the components and information theory needed to construct biohybrid devices that could eventually be embedded within a biological system and provide electronic control. In addition to building capabilities for designing and constructing completely new biodevices, a most important aspect of this work is that it will bring together researchers and stakeholders from many disciplines, including biology, chemistry, materials science, and computer, electrical, chemical, and bioengineering.  The project builds on the interdisciplinary nature of the project with Research Team from computer science, electrical engineering and bioengineering. The research thrusts span computer science and information theory, microelectromechanical systems, biofabrication and redox biology, and synthetic biology.  Also, two interdisciplinary teams of undergraduate students from UMD and UNL will participate in the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) program and competition, and participate in specific outreach activities targeting Middle and High school students within the Future Problem Solving Program (FPSPI) at UNL.  Further, this project will promote the participation of women, historically underrepresented in electrical engineering, representing more than majors in biology and bioengineering.  RE-BIONICS researchers will also interact with federal agencies including NIST, FDA, and the Army Research Laboratory, gaining exposure to manufacturing and regulatory issues, as well as direct application areas such as national security. <br/><br/>This project exploits reduction-oxidation (redox) mediators that are the biological equivalents of free electrons in electronics. The reactions represent packets of information transferred within biology.  The project is organized into three specific aims. In Aim 1, the team will design, build and test device elements that facilitate information transfer from molecules of biological systems to electrons of microelectronic systems and the reverse. Using the principles of synthetic biology, bacterial cells will be engineered to recognize small signaling molecules, an example being pyocyanin that is secreted by opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on this recognition, these and other engineered sensing cells will produce -galactosidase, an enzyme that can be electrochemically quantified. In addition, cells will be engineered to accept electrons from devices and in a programmed manner, ""turn on"" gene expression that can modulate cell behavior. In Aim 2, the team will design and construct a biological read/write memory device, based on the biopolymer melanin, that can be accessed both biologically and electronically. In Aim 3, the team will integrate these elements creating biohybrid circuits, such as bioelectric logic gates, and biologic to electronic to biologic signaling systems, culminating in an electronically-controlled device that interprets molecular information, computes desired outcomes and electronically actuates cells to signal and control biological populations.  There are three fundamentally novel aspects to this work. First, it will demonstrate the potential to transfer information from biological systems to microelectronic systems and the reverse, forming the basis for bioelectronic integrated computing systems. Second, it will demonstrate electronically-controlled synthesis of a novel, reliable and stable biological memory device. Third, it will develop a technological framework for the development of bio-hybrid computing devices that efficiently sense and process chemical information as well as operate within and control complex biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While use of a significant level of renewable energy is crucial to addressing issues of climate change, addition of these unreliable sources exacerbates the complexity of system operations. Effective use of consumer-side resources in power system operations and markets will allow the maximum use of variable renewable resources, leading to beneficial economic and environmental outcomes for society as a whole. In order to address the inclusion of demand-side resources effectively in the future grid, the response reliability of this resource must be both understood and included in power system operations and decision-making. The goal of this research is the development of an efficient and effective framework for integrated use of demand-side and renewable resources in the evolving power system.  The project will also develop interactive activities to facilitate introduction of systems thinking into k-12 classrooms, in support of the Next Generation Science Standards. <br/><br/>A primary challenge of adding additional uncertain resources to the power systems lies in the increase in dimensionality and complexity of the existing optimization models used for system planning and dispatch. The outcomes of this project are transformative because they provide a robust and truly representative framework integrating uncertain resources on both the demand and supply side, at the fundamental operational time frames of the power system and markets.   These goals will be achieved through three primary aims 1) Build the tools to accurately describe intermittent renewable resources, such as wind and solar, to better characterize the uncertainties and interactions for tractable representation in stochastic optimization methods, 2) Characterize responsive demand resources across multiple time scales including characteristics, constraints and uncertainties of various classes, and 3) Develop the multi-period stochastic optimization framework that includes DR into a scalable security constrained unit commitment model by including dispatchable DR resources as stochastic constraints, with additional constraints on frequency and duration of response, and to ensure that the solutions generated are available in reasonable time frames to benefit power system operations.  <br/><br/>The proposed project will support the evolution to the Smart Grid through provision of analytical tools to manage increasing complexity, and to understand the synergies of new technologies. The educational contribution of this project has components designed to enhance participation of women and under-represented minorities in the field, and build excitement about computational applications in energy systems among graduate students. In addition, this project will reach nearly 100 science classrooms in the Northeast US through collaborative development and delivery of teacher professional development and classroom materials supporting systems thinking and modeling, a new cross-cutting theme in the Next Generation Science Standards."

In some of the pursued implementations, information is carried by coherent spin dynamics in magnetic materials through the spin waves, which can be generated by injecting spin current into nanomagnets. It is now well known that many different spin wave modes are simultaneously produced by spin current injection, but their spectral distribution, or the mechanisms controlling it, are not well known, hindering the progress in achieving coherent spin-based device operation. The proposed Project will develop new experimental approaches enabling the characterization of spectral distribution of spin waves generated by spin current, and establish the methods to control it. The possibility that the spin waves form a quasi-equilibrium distribution, described by the effective thermodynamic parameters - temperature and chemical potential will be tested. This will allow the proposed research to identify the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of dynamical states in nanomagnetic systems driven by spin currents. The resulting ability to achieve highly coherent magnetization dynamics will contribute to the progress in the implementation of efficient spin-based devices. The project will contribute to the burgeoning Engineering Sciences degree at Emory University, by developing training modules for the new hands-on experimental Materials Science course, and to the highly successful Atlanta Science Festival, by developing educational demos for the general public.<br/><br/>The main goal of the Project is to establish the relation between the dynamical and the thermodynamic characteristics of nanomagnetic systems driven by spin current, which will enable efficient engineering and optimization of these characteristics for nanodevice applications. Magneto-optical micro-focus Brillouin Light spectroscopy technique will be utilized to determine the spectral distribution of spin wave quanta  known as the magnons. To achieve a broad spectral sensitivity of the technique, momentum-space squeezing and plasmonic effects will be utilized to concentrate the probing light into deep sub-wavelength regions. The obtained results will be used to quantitatively test the hypothesis that nanomagnetic systems driven by spin current can form a quasi-equilibrium state characterized by the effective thermodynamic parameters such as chemical potential and temperature. This will allow the project to establish the relationship between the previously achieved coherent spin current-induced dynamics and Bose-Einstein condensation, a coherent dynamical state spontaneously formed when the chemical potential becomes equal to the lowest magnon energy. By establishing this relation, number of fundamentally and practically important questions will be addressed, such as the role of different dynamical spectral modes play in a magnetic systems in the formation of coherent states, what nonlinear magnon-magnon interactions prevent or facilitate the formation of these states, can they be controlled by engineering the dynamical spectrum, is there a possibility to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation driven by spin current and can the condensate be formed in a large volume of the magnetic system, or is it always localized in nanoscale regions. By addressing these questions, an unprecedented level of understanding of dynamical magnetization states, and the ability to control them for spin-based device applications, will be achieved.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a dynamic broadband optical router, if realized, would enable the far-field steering of beams, enabling new optical system functionalities such as signal multiplexing and routing. Today, the closest state-of-the-art solutions to the proposed system are ones based on MEMS micro-mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators. In comparison to these known systems, the proposed device would be revolutionary in terms of switching speed, compactness, and versatile reconfigurability with the benefit of no moving parts. The physical and design principles, large-area manufacturing technologies, and software developed in this program will prove invaluable for future developments of the proposed dynamic achromatic optical router. All co-investigators will supervise undergraduate students, including individuals belonging to under-represented groups in sciences and engineering, building on their extensive track record in this important area. Co-PIs will employ a unified plan of action to incorporate nanophotonics into curricula, including classes in nanophotonics and openly accessible lecture notes. Furthermore, co-PIs will organize and establish a summer experience workshop for K-12 students in their respective community e.g. in Science Museums and Science Fair, an activity that will be closely coordinated with the institution and reported to NSF annually. They will also organize summer school, with emphasis on minority and under-represented participants. <br/><br/>Conventional approaches to the design of metasurfaces rely on subwavelength, near-resonance, metallic or dielectric scatterers as building blocks. The major drawback of such an approach is that the shaping of the wavefront can only be engineered for a frequency, since the scattered phase for each resonator depends on frequency in a highly nonlinear fashion. Indeed, the implementation of metasurfaces that function achromatically across a broad range of frequencies remains a formidable challenge. In conjunction, the electrical tunability of such anomalous reflection would represent a truly revolutionary device concept which can potentially employed in a variety of optical systems in a disruptive manner. Here, co-PIs propose novel strategies to do just that. The anomalous reflections required to achieve this tuning are induced by a phase gradient along a sub-wavelength-scale nanostructured metasurface mediated by gap plasmons within ITO based nanogap structures. Electrical tuning is achieved through ITO materials, which modifies the phase velocity of the gap plasmons and exhibits true time delay which allows for electro-optic control. This program will design the above-mentioned one-dimensional dynamic achromatic optical router, fabricate the device, evaluate its performance and fundamental limits, and perform scatterometry measurement to corroborate with theory. The device will be realized with a unique high-throughput nanomanufacturing method, atomic layer lithography that allows us to realize ultrahigh-aspect-ratio metal trenches needed for this work. If realized, the proposed device constitutes an electrically controllable plasmonic optical router that can be employed in a variety of optical systems, specifically where achromatic control of the light path on a pixel-by-pixel basis is essential, and cannot otherwise be achieved with current state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also necessitates new classes of devices that are capable of processing quantum signals. One promising approach to engineered quantum systems uses low-temperature superconducting circuits to perform quantum information processing. These quantum machines are now being developed actively in academic, government, and industrial labs around the world. However, there is no way to connect these systems to one another across more than a few inches while preserving their important quantum properties. Creating links that traverse longer distances and leave the low temperature environments of the qubits demands converting the quantum information from a form suited for processing to another form suited for transmission, and vice versa. In fact, all computation, sensing, and communication systems depend on devices that convert information from one form to another. The lack of this capability in the quantum domain impedes the emergence of truly compelling quantum technologies that promise to perform tasks beyond the means of today's technologies. The proposed research effort is focused on creating such a capability to address a basic and long-standing challenge in engineering science. The program will develop and demonstrate a device that can convert quantum information across the electromagnetic spectrum while preserving its important quantum properties. Such a device, a quantum electro-optic converter, will convert information between optical photons capable of travelling long distances, and microwave photons in low-temperature superconducting circuits being used to implement the first quantum computers. Much like the electro-optic modulators that enable the Internet, quantum electro-optic converters may someday enable the quantum Internet.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to develop a device that can interconvert quantum information between optical and microwave frequencies. The approach is to fabricate high-Q optical cavities and microwave superconducting cavities on the same electro-optical substrate, heterogeneously integrated silicon on lithium niobate, and to generate interactions between excitations in the two cavities. To achieve this, recently developed techniques for creating high-Q electro-optic photonic crystal cavities, techniques for making high-Q superconducting inductors with very low stray capacitance, as well as theoretical insight on perfect quantum state conversion methods will be used. The PI's lab will develop the technology for quantum electro-optic converters by advancing and synthesizing techniques from photonics, heterogeneous integration, superconducting circuits, and cryogenic optical and microwave experiments to realize this vision. The quantum electro-optic converter being developed in this program promises to 1) connect these quantum machines to each other, 2) allow optical access to quantum nonlinearities at microwave frequencies, and 3) to simplify their scaling to larger numbers of superconducting qubits by allowing multiplexing of many microwave signals over an optical fiber. This will have a major impact on experimental quantum information science. Finally, the device will demonstrate for the first time quantum optical control of microwave circuits using laser light, which can enable new and unforeseen types of quantum sensing and communications capabilities at microwave frequencies."

In many cases the electronic chirality is facilitated by the specific structure of the system in which it emerges, either on atomic scale or on mesoscopic scale. Recently, it was discovered that one of the well-studied macroscopically correlated electronic state, the charge density wave, also exhibits chiral properties. This proposal explores the opportunity to use the nanometer-size domains of opposite chirality that are separated with domain walls as basic elements for memory and logic units.<br/>In this proposal we will expand the fundamental understanding of the dynamic nature of the coupling of the chiral CDW with femtosecond optical perturbations and nanosecond current pulses. The dynamics of the excited metastable states through which the system traverses before coming back to equilibrium could include unconventional order such as ferroelectricity, CDW or superconductivity. The origin of these phenomena is in the existence of various types of symmetry breaking (inversion symmetry in TiSe2) that gives rise to degenerate ground states. The opportunity exists to exploit these metastable states in low power electronic devices. We will also optimize the growth of TiSe2 thin films in order to enable efficient device fabrication. The effect on strain and doping on chiral CDW thermodynamics will be explored."

In the past two decades, a myriad of new applications have arisen due to the ability to sculpt the laser beam profile for tailor made applications.  Annular shaped beams called Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams promise to greatly enhance communications channels, both in the classical and quantum domains.  The variety of applications of LG beams calls for a large range of operating wavelengths and powers, and at present there is no unified source. The proposed work is aimed at exploring the basic optical science needed to create a high-power, tunable, and compact source of LG beams.  The approach is built upon the existing technology of Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VECSELs) that have been demonstrated as a source of high-power and tunable Gaussian beams.  Our proposed approach is to introduce mode control elements into the laser cavity in such a way to force the generation of LG as opposed to Gaussian beams.  Our ultimate goal is to be able to do this in a way that preserves the high-power, tunability, and compactness of the existing VECSEL technology.  <br/><br/>Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams are in great demand due to their tremendous utility over a large range of applied and fundamental sciences.  The corresponding light beams carry optical angular momentum (OAM) and are characterized by a spiral phase variation in the transverse plane.  Despite numerous applications the development of a compact source of high power and tunable LG modes remains a major challenge.  The goal of the present EAGER proposal is to develop a unified and compact source for LG modes that can deliver the dual virtues of high power and wavelength tunability.  In particular we shall explore the opportunities and limitations of extending current VECSEL technology to produce LG beams by means of intracavity mode conversion, which if successful opens the door to a high-power source of tunable LG beams.  The proposed research therefore has implications for both applied and basic science, from future communications and information processing technologies, to fundamental research in quantum information and nanotechnology. The research will combine modeling and experimental investigation of advanced semiconductor laser cavity, mode mixing, nonlinear beam generation, and application based characterization."

In all these cases, lasers are commonly used as devices and instruments that are separate from the patients. The goal of the proposed research is to invent a new type of laser that is made biologically compatible and readily amenable to living organisms and human body. Such bio-lasers can be integrated into the biological systems and thereby have a potential to offer new ways of using laser light in biomedical sensing and diagnosis, as well as therapy.

This project continues to explore the new territory in the field of laser and show how the unique properties of cell lasers can be harnessed to develop novel photonic devices and technologies. The experimental approach is highly interdisciplinary as it brings together physical and biological sciences and engineering. This work will increase our understanding about the design, operation, and applications of cell lasers, and points to a way to realize ""living laser"", where all three basic elements, i.e. amplification, resonance, and pumping, are achieved with biological materials in vivo.

Current nanoscale subsurface imaging techniques require extensive sample preparation, are exceptionally slow, and require expensive equipment. Or they are simply unable to image opaque samples. The solution is a tool which provides non-destructive, high throughput nanoscale imaging of buried defects at a reasonable cost. This project will combine scanning probe microscopy with ultrasound holography to reveal and characterize subsurface features with nanoscale resolution in three dimensions. In this technology, a cantilever monitors acoustic waves that travel along the surface. Perturbations to the amplitude and phase of these waves carry information about structures beneath and near the surface. These variations are detected as small differences in frequency and phase, resulting in beats that are detected by the cantilever. These variations are then used to create spatial mappings generated by subsurface and near-surface features and defects as the cantilever scans across the surface. The ultimate aim is to integrate scanning probe microscopy hardware with functional electronics into field-programmable gate arrays, configurable integrated circuits.

Current nanoscale subsurface imaging techniques are unable to probe optically opaque samples or require extensive and time consuming sample preparation, are exceptionally slow, and require expensive metrology equipment. The solution is a tool which provides non-destructive, high throughput nanoscale imaging of buried defects, and that can be widely deployed at multiple points in the research and development cycle, at a reasonable cost. Anticipated applications will identify buried nanostructures in semiconductor, MEMS, and low-K dielectric materials both in 2D and 3D geometries. This innovative technology will bring transformative research in identifying the failure analysis and buried defects both in 2D and 3D materials stacks in complex three-dimensional devices and structural geometries with nanometer scale resolution. In this technology, the cantilever monitors the perturbation to the surface acoustic waves, especially their phase, which carry information about embedded or buried sub-structures reflected in the scattering of specimen acoustic waves due to the difference in their respective viscoelastic properties. Variations in the amplitude and phase of the bulk wave due to the presence of the sub-surface nanostructures/defects as well as the variations in near surface affect the amplitude and the phase of the difference frequency signal (beats) which is detected by cantilever. These variations are used to create spatial mappings generated by subsurface and near-surface features/defects. To realize these efforts requires a way to combine scanning probe microscopy hardware, functional electronics and its integration into field programmable gate arrays for simultaneous generation and detection of multiple harmonics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, such a semiconductor-based UV photodetector is not available, which hampers many high speed and low signal applications. TMD semiconductors reveal remarkable properties. Their unique crystal structure leads to the creation of a unique type of strongly bound excitons, known as van Hove singularity excitons that are created when a UV photon interacts with a TMD semiconductor. TMD materials will be studied to understand the basic physical properties of these excitons and to utilize them for optoelectronic applications in the UV region and ultimately for the development of a new ultrafast, fast-response, and high-sensitivity UV photodetector. This research is expected to have significant technological impacts ranging from everyday life to new communication tools. It will be conducted at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution and will involve undergraduate and Master's students and students from local high schools. The active participation in the project will provide students an excellent nanoscience research experience and an outstanding opportunity to train in nanoscale optoelectronics preparing them for careers in industry and academia.

The goal of the project is to advance the fundamental understanding of such devices by studying the intriguing properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Ultimately a prototype of a nanoscale, ultrasensitive (~few photons) and fast UV photodetector will be developed by exploiting van Hove singularity assisted excitonic transitions in atomically thin monolayer TMDs derived from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2. The unique crystal structures of these semiconductors create a Mexican hat-like optical band structure. The joint density of states diverges at the bottom of the Mexican hat creating the van Hove singularity. The objectives of the project are: (i) Investigate the van Hove singularity assisted optoelectronic properties of monolayer TMDs derived from bulk crystals by measuring the photocurrent spectra, photoresponsivity, and time responses. (ii) Investigate the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of large-scale chemical vapor deposited TMDs and measure their photocurrent and time responses to elucidate how line defects and grain boundaries affect the optoelectronic properties. (iii) Stack monolayer TMDs to develop a UV photodetector that exhibits high absorption, a GHz photoresponse speed, and a few photon detection ability. This research will advance the fundamental understanding of novel, many-body excitonic phenomena in physics, not only in 2D systems, but also in other nanoscale systems ranging from Bose-Einstein condensation to excitonic solar cells and has great promise for the development of scalable nanophotonic devices."

To meet demand, cellular providers need access to more bandwidth, which also happens to be their primary capital expenditure. By making better use of available spectrum in the 30-300 GHz, i.e., mm-wave band, providers not only could offer less costly service, but also could potentially make transformative cellular access and coverage improvements for current customers and the underserved. This project addresses a number of stubborn technical obstacles limiting mm-wave band use. To overcome these challenges, a multidisciplinary team will extend signal processing, communication theory, and electromagnetics knowledge to develop novel reconfigurable antennas and communication technologies for this band. Further, strong industry connections among team members will help facilitate commercialization. The project also includes goals to share a mm-wave testbed with industry and the public for remote testing, and to educate students at several universities--notably at California State University, Bakersfield, which primarily serves underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The project goal is to leverage the additional degrees of freedom provided by a new reconfigurable antenna design to establish new beamforming and beamsteering methodologies that overcome substantive propagation challenges at mm-wave frequencies.

From an engineering perspective, a central focus of this work will be the development of efficient strategies to design secure and efficient critical networked infrastructures. In particular, those factors that make a network efficient and/or resilient with respect to a particular dynamical process will be explored. For example, the following questions will be studied: What structural factors make a communication network efficient in the coordination of a group of robotic agents? What network properties are useful while containing the spread of a disease in a human contact network? Since networks are ubiquitous across science and engineering, developing efficient tools for network analysis and design is of great relevance to many scientific disciplines.

Despite the various advantages of this low-cost technology in a biomedical imaging context including high image contrasts and suitable penetration depths, it has not been applied to any such application. The main reason is its limitation in providing sufficient resolutions for diagnostic purposes. This proposal offers a novel approach by which an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically. This will improve image resolutions to values previously unattained. The main focus of this proposal is the development of a portable and low-cost skin imaging device that can image tissue layers over their depths with high resolutions while offering satisfactory contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. By diagnosing skin tumors at an early stage, the device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation's healthcare system.

This cannot be realized by any conventional design method and is therefore assembled ""synthetically"", resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of acquired images. The synthetic increase is achieved by dividing the desired bandwidth into a number of adjacent sub-bands or channels. Each channel contains an antenna unit which is optimized for operation within that specific sub-band. The sub-band antennas are successively placed in front of the target, transmit their signals, and record the backscattered responses. The responses are then processed and combined to synthesize an integrated signal as if it were collected from a virtual equivalent ultra-wideband antenna. By using this concept, the challenges of realizing high-performance ultra-wideband antennas in the millimeter-wave regime are alleviated as each antenna is optimized within a limited bandwidth. An imaging system will be developed based on this approach for the detection of skin tumors in ex-vivo tissue measurements. The system will be optimized and miniaturized through developing a new class of wideband, miniaturized patch antennas for use in multi-static sensor arrays. The final imaging setup will be readily applicable to point-of-care and hand-held imaging devices. The <br/>""synthetic"" ultra-wideband imaging approach will lead to image resolutions which are unachievable using conventional imaging methods. The approach is versatile, as the number and position of the channels can be adjusted to cover any frequency range as required for the specific application. These capabilities bring a whole new level of functionality to millimeter-wave imaging systems and enable applications that are not currently feasible. Furthermore, the new class of wideband, miniaturized patch antennas which will be developed for the miniaturization and optimization of the final imagining setup will be highly desirable for a variety of communication and imaging applications in the millimeter-wave regime."

Universal quantum computers with the ability to solve problems beyond the capability of present supercomputers have yet to be realized. This interdisciplinary project focuses on whether the assembly of organic dye molecules into complex excitonic networks using DNA self-assembly provides a viable path for the construction of such computers. An exciton is the packet of energy that resides in an organic dye molecule when it is in its excited state. This packet of energy is a quantum mechanical object that exhibits both wave-like and particle-like behavior just as light does. A manifestation of the wave-like behavior of the exciton is its ability to spread out over a dye molecule network so that it resides on multiple chromophores simultaneously. This process is referred to as excitonic quantum coherent energy transfer. A manifestation of the particle-like behavior is that two excitons can collide and scatter off of each other as they spread over a dye molecule network. By exploiting these two behaviors, in principle, dye molecules can be arranged into networks that function as quantum gates and quantum computers. In order for quantum coherent energy transfer to occur, dye molecules must be brought within a few nanometers of each other and, in order to build a quantum gate, dye molecules must be found for which quantum coherence can be maintained over a large dye network. The fundamental issue this research is seeking to address is whether dye molecules of sufficient quality can be found and whether these can be arranged into the complex networks with the close spacing required in order to make a functioning quantum gate and thereby provide a path to scalable universal quantum computation. This research program provides Boise State University students specific educating, training and mentoring in nanophotonics and computational materials science. This experience equips these students to meet the ever evolving and advancing technological needs of both local and national high tech industries and educational and scientific institutions. Combining education, training, and research with outreach, this research will advance the discovery, innovation, and overall knowledge-based prosperity of science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The goal of this research is to develop a new materials system for the assembly of quantum computers in which quantum computation is carried out by a many-exciton quantum walk over a network of dye molecules. The two primary tasks of this research are (1) to identify suitable dye molecules and (2) to determine the means by which these dye molecules, when covalently attached to DNA, can be arranged into the requisite configurations to function as quantum gates. In the first task, dye molecules are identified that, when paired using DNA assembly, exhibit large Davydov splitting and strong exciton-exciton interactions as determined by absorption spectroscopy and differential absorption spectroscopy, respectively. In the second task, how best to covalently attach dye molecules to DNA substrates to form quantum coherently interacting dye networks is established. A fundamental issue addressed by this research is how to effectively perform computation with excitons. The work impacts existing quantum computation research by providing new gate architectures that are robust against dispersion and decoherence and that have faster switching times than existing quantum gates.<br/>The grant is co-funded by the following programs, OIA; EPSCoR; CISE; ENG; and MPS."

Finally, adaptive THz wireless communication links (enabled by tunable filters and beam-steering/forming antennas) to be demonstrated will significantly bolster current efforts to develop advanced THz devices, circuits and systems, and may have profound impact on 5G cellular networks, secure military and defense links, the internet of things, chip-to-chip interconnection, 4K TV signal broadcasting, and multi-medium downloading. The project also provides significant educational opportunities for students.  The graduate students in this program will be exposed to the full scope of semiconductor physics, electromagnetic wave propagation, advanced imaging, THz system design and testing process, wireless communication, from a single device to the component/circuit/system level. A cooperative education activity will be initiated between the University of Notre Dame and Oregon State University with remote graduate-level lectures. Undergraduate students will be involved through summer and honors thesis research. The PIs will advise and mentor students from underrepresented groups. Finally, this project will also promote science and engineering education among local middle- and high-schools.  <br/><br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to explore and demonstrate a novel high-performance optical THz spatial modulation technology based on a mesa-array approach for efficiently achieving tunable and reconfigurable quasi-optical devices that are required in advanced THz imaging and adaptive THz wireless communication systems. This technology would offer sub-wavelength spatial resolution, higher than 100 dB modulation depth, higher speed, and permit high-resolution photo-defined patterns to be virtually generated for devices and components operated at high THz frequencies with multi-functionality. Using this mesa-array technology as a platform, tunable/reconfigurable THz quasi-optical devices, including imaging coded masks, beam steering and forming antennas and universally-tunable filters, with performance and versatility far beyond those realized by conventional approaches will be investigated and demonstrated. Acting on the above investigation, a compact, dynamically programmable THz quasi-optical device/component module will be developed. By employing such modules as building blocks, three advanced THz imaging architectures 1) high-speed THz near-field imaging with sub-wavelength resolution, 2) real-time ultra-sensitive passive THz imaging, and 3) spectrally-resolved THz imaging and prototype adaptive THz wireless communication links will be demonstrated. The project will involve semiconductor physics, THz science and technology, imaging theory, wireless communication, and high-frequency testing and characterization to implement and demonstrate the proposed novel approach for tunable/reconfigurable THz quasi-optical devices.

Compact sources of terahertz radiation that operate with both high output power and excellent beam quality are needed for a range of spectroscopy and multi-spectral imaging applications (i.e. where different terahertz wavelengths/colors provide additional image contrast). For example, applications in the fields of astrophysics, atmospheric science, biological and medical sciences, security screening, illicit material detection, and non-destructive evaluation all can benefit from terahertz sources. Terahertz quantum-cascade lasers are one of the most promising sources of radiation in this spectral range, however several hurdles must still be overcome to make them more practical. In past research, this team has demonstrated a new laser architecture that addresses the challenge of how to get high power simultaneously with high beam quality, known as the THz quantum-cascade vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser. The next challenge is to make this architecture work in a ""broadband"" configuration, i.e. how to make lasers that emit across a wide range of wavelengths, without sacrificing power or beam quality. Hence, the unifying theme of this research is to develop a set of approaches that allow terahertz lasers to emit either (a) a single wavelength of light that can be tuned across a wide range, or (b) many wavelengths of light simultaneously across a wide range. Much of this work focuses upon design of a key enabling component: the so-called ""active metasurface"", which can be considered an artificial mirror, which not only reflects the light, but amplifies it as well. As a part of the project, the research will train graduate and undergraduate students, and will support recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities to engineering through participation in a targeted research project course.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is the development of broadband terahertz quantum-cascade lasers based upon amplifying reflectarray metasurfaces, and that operate both with scalable high power and excellent beam quality. Within this overarching theme, we propose two primary thrusts: (a) the development of widely-tunable single-mode THz external cavity lasers, (b) the development of broadband multi-mode THz lasers and frequency combs. The enabling component of the vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting-laser is a reflectarray metasurface made up of sub-wavelength antenna-coupled microcavities loaded with laser gain material; this creates an active amplifying mirror which serves as one mirror in an open cavity. The intellectual merit in the proposed work is present in the development of novel reflectarray metasurfaces that provide gain over a large fractional bandwidths. A secondary innovation lies in the novel laser cavity configurations that are newly enabled by the flexibility of metasurface design. The power of this approach lies in (a) the ability of the VECSEL cavity configuration to support scalable high powers in a diffraction limited beam, and (b) the flexibility to locally engineer the amplitude, phase, and polarization response of the metasurface in both the spatial and spectral domain. The impact for spectroscopy and multi-spectral imaging is potentially large, since many previous demonstrations of tunable single-mode THz quantum-cascade lasers and frequency combs are either limited in output power, have a poor beam pattern, or both. The broader impacts are addressed at several levels including undergraduate and graduate research experiences, dissemination of results, and technology advancement. Outreach will specifically occur through the development of research projects for a course designed for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority URM engineering freshmen."

A novel sensor, based on high-speed version of the most sensitive charge detector, single-electron transistor (SET), will be used. This sensor employs arrays of SETs and radio-frequency reflectometry to give information on fast charging processes, occurring in a microsecond time frame.  The capabilities of this technique enable experiments that cannot be performed using traditional measurements of surface potentials.  For instance, in existing measurements the scanning probe disturbs the surface that is being measured, making it difficult to measure charges, such as electrons, that are only weakly confined to an area of the surface.  In contrast, the measurements made in this project will be much less disruptive to the surface, making it possible to observe phenomena such as Wigner localization of electrons.  The project also involves an outreach program that will target middle school students in South Bend Schools through classroom activities involving faculty and graduate students, and field trips to bring students to the Notre Dame labs. These activities will contact 50 - 100 students per year. Middle school aged children are an excellent group for outreach since they are advanced enough to understand science, but are still making choices about their areas of interests. South Bend public schools have a diverse student population with a large number of students from groups underrepresented in the areas of science and technology.<br/><br/>This project will use ultra-sensitive electrometers coupled to a scanned probe system to map the potential of material surfaces.  In surface potential measurements, two methods dominate: Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) and Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM). Kelvin probe is the more popular technique because it produces a quantitative measurement of the contact potential difference (CPD) while EFM can measure only qualitative changes in CPD. This project design and fabricate scanning single-electron transistor probes (S-SETs) and use them to characterize the surface charge and potential of semiconductor surfaces. The S-SET probes will use radio-frequency reflectometry to enable measurements of the CPD with high charge and potential sensitivity, as well as high spatial and temporal resolution. Arrays of SETs will be used to provide improved immunity to random background charge fluctuations, and to provide improved matching to the RF circuit, eliminating the need for a complicated resonant network.  In addition, the use of an RF SET will enable a Kelvin force measurement, not yet reported in the literature, that will be less invasive than those made by conventional KPFM.  With the scanned probe system it will be possible to characterize a variety of surfaces including semiconductors and insulators.  In particular, the system will be used to investigate Wigner localization of electrons within semiconductor quantum dots."

Among various wide bandgap semiconductors, b-Ga2O3 has a stable thermodynamic property with a large bandgap and high electron mobility which makes it an attractive semiconductor candidate for next-generation power electronics and optoelectronics. Despite promising material property of b-Ga2O3, two well-known deficiencies of b-Ga2O3, namely, the poor thermal conductivity and the lack of efficient p-type dopant largely prohibit the use of b-Ga2O3 toward wider spectrum power electronics. This proposal aims to address the unipolar doping challenge and poor thermal property of n-type b-Ga2O3 by heterogeneously integrating with p-type single crystalline diamond, which allows us to bond two dissimilar semiconductors without restricted by lattice constants of b-Ga2O3 and diamond. To create a novel n-type b-Ga2O3 and p-type diamond heterojunction, an ultra-thin form of semiconductor, also called semiconductor nanomembranes, will be used. Building upon this, the specific objective of the proposed project is to realize the new class of ultra-wide bandgap high power heterojunction bipolar transistors based on the multiple p-n junctions using p-type diamond nanomembrane and n-type b-Ga2O3 nanomembrane.

Can a single leader move public opinion from one state to any arbitrary desired state?

AMT has strong potential for controlled, rapid, and effective inspection of targeted (surface or volumetric) regions of rehabilitated concrete infrastructure. By combining the benefits of multiple NDT techniques, unique features of multiple methods can be brought together to achieve new results that one method alone cannot achieve. A significant advantage to the integration of these techniques lies in the ability to capitalize on microwave signal properties to achieve focused and localized heating. The outcomes of this research will result in a new NDT method with broad-reaching applications for inspection of aging infrastructure, which has direct benefits to society through cost-savings and general safety of the public. In addition, this research establishes an approach for simulation and experimental aspects that will serve as a solid developmental platform for expansion of AMT to other fields such as medical, aerospace, and security. Research opportunities within this project will be offered to underrepresented (minority/female high school through graduate) students.

A significant advantage to merging these techniques lies in the ability to capitalize on the strengths of microwave NDT and thermography while improving their limitations. A key benefit to utilizing microwave energy as a heat source is the potential for controlled and targeted heating, thereby improving the efficacy of thermography. The tasks proposed in this project will be conducted through multi-physics based microwave and thermal simulations and will be subsequently verified with measurements. A materials characterization effort will be conducted to characterize the materials used in rehabilitated concrete structures from an electromagnetics point-of-view. This information will be invaluable for other applications where such materials are utilized. Moreover, as part of the material characterization effort, this work capitalizes on microwave-induced heating to determine information about electric dipole moments. This study will also provide information necessary to build predictive models for how a material will physically respond to microwave heating and eventually predetermine thermal signatures for healthy and defective samples. Further, these tasks will address critical issues including the effectiveness and optimization of microwave heating and the detection sensitivity of AMT to flaws/defects. Moreover, current literature states that modulated lock-in methods are not possible for AMT due to the interaction between the microwave energy and thermal camera hardware. However, AMT systems can be designed to reduce the electromagnetic interference with the thermal camera, thereby alleviating this limitation and opening the door for a more successful utilization of this technique. Additionally, this study will explore the potential for advanced signal processing techniques that utilize microwave-specific attributes such as polarization control and patterned heating that will lead to improved defect detection and characterization capabilities. Overall, the project outcomes will not only result in a new inspection method for the transportation and infrastructure industries, but also a development platform for applications of AMT in other important industries such as medical, aerospace, and security."

Existing monochromatic sources have low output power and/or highly divergent beams, which makes them unsuitable for important applications in terahertz sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy. This project aims to develop terahertz semiconductor lasers that could emit up to hundred milliwatts of average optical power in a narrow beam with less than five degrees of angular divergence.

At educational level, the research will be made accessible to undergraduate students especially from diverse backgrounds, who will get hands-on training toward advanced concepts in laser design and characterization, plasmonics, terahertz science, and cryogenic electrical and optical measurements.<br/><br/>Technical description<br/>Cryogenically cooled semiconductor quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) are the most powerful solid-state sources of coherent terahertz radiation; however, presently, single-mode terahertz lasers operating at practically viable temperatures could only radiate average optical power in the order of a milliwatt, which is insufficient for most targeted applications. This proposal seeks to improve power output from such QCLs by two-orders of magnitude in the range of hundred milliwatts with significantly improved beam quality. A portable electrically operated Stirling cryocooler will provide the required cooling for the semiconductor laser chips that could have tens of such phase-locked QCL arrays emitting at a range of discrete terahertz frequencies. Such a development could lead to commercialization of terahertz QCLs similar to the highly successful mid-infrared QCLs that have spawned recent economic activity in tens of companies worldwide. Terahertz QCLs utilize parallel-plate metallic cavities with strong mode confinement, for which a unique modal coupling scheme for multiple cavities through surface via the surrounding medium (vacuum or air) is proposed. Owing to the very long wavelengths at terahertz frequencies, it is shown that in-phase surface-plasmon-polariton modes for coupled cavities can be excited with periodic photonic structures fabricated using conventional lithography. Radiation in an ultra-narrow beam is expected owing to the spatially extended radiated wavefront of the phased-locked optical mode.<br/>Development of high-power terahertz lasers has the potential to enable commercial activity in terahertz spectroscopy, sensing, and imaging. Laser based terahertz instruments could lead to new insights in fields as diverse as cell-biology for study of biomolecular structure and dynamics, non-destructive evaluation and detection of drugs, pharmaceutical products, explosives, non-invasive imaging of biological samples, and remote-sensing of Earth's atmosphere and outer space. A successful outcome of this project will potentially lead to collaborations with industry (specifically, semiconductor laser companies), some of which have shown recent interest for development of terahertz instruments. At the University level, special efforts will be made to involve undergraduate students especially from diverse backgrounds in the research activities during each year."

In mechanical energy harvesting alone, several types of electric power generators have been demonstrated, including piezoelectric, electrokinetic and triboelectric generators. These devices have enabled a wide range of applications, from small self-powered devices to auxiliary power units for wearable electronics. However, due to the short-lived electric current, these power generators are most efficient for vibrational energy harvesting at a relatively high frequency and inherently limited in the low frequency regime where every-day human activities such as walking take place. This research project aims to develop a unique type of mechanical energy harvester that exploits the typical configuration of the electrochemical cells in batteries and specifically targets harvesting low frequency motions. Such energy harvesters may work as auxiliary generators, powering ubiquitous computing, communications and wearable electronics. The project will also offer interdisciplinary research experience in experimental design, computational materials science and mechanics to both undergraduates and graduates at MIT and Penn State, as well as enhance minority involvement and participation in science and engineering, and stimulate the interests of students in the research field of innovative energy-storage materials and energy harvesting.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to uncover the underlying mechanisms of electrochemically driven mechanical energy harvesting so as to control and optimize power and energy generation at targeted low frequency through an integrated experimental-modeling approach. To fulfill this goal, the team will adopt a multiscale method to model the stress-voltage coupling and to predict current and power output of mechanical energy harvesters. Guided by the modeling results, mechanical energy harvester prototypes will be fabricated, tested and diagnosed. The integrated experimental-modeling approach enables a fundamental understanding of the key design parameters that govern the performance of mechanical energy harvesters in particular, and helps foster transformative progress for understanding a broad range of stress-mediated electrochemical processes in general."

An adversary can exploit the connections between the layers and launch an advanced persistent threat (APT) attack that is accomplished through a set of multi-stage stealthy and continuous hacking processes.  Lessons learned from APT attacks have highlighted the fact that the design for perfect security is not always possible or prohibitively expensive, and hence resilience is an equally important mechanism that can complement the imperfect security. The standard analysis tools are insufficient to cope with the complexity of CPS and address the design of security and resilience mechanisms.  To this end, the project aims to establish an integrated game-theoretic framework that adopts both reductionist and integrative approaches to engineer high-confidence CPS. The proposed research uses electric power systems and the cloud-enabled autonomous systems as two case studies to illustrate the designs of cyber defense strategies, resilience control mechanisms, and CPS security-aware contracts as the holistic cyber, physical, and human solution to for next-generation high-confidence infrastructure systems. <br/><br/>The methodologies developed in the project establish an inter-disciplinary system science to conceptualize and design high-confidence CPS, and expedite the realization of CPS in a wide range of applications including transportation, industrial automation, and the power grid. The project first leverages system engineering principles to create game motifs or gamelets as building blocks and use them to compose a game of games or meta-game to model heterogeneous interactions of system components within the layers, across the layers, and with an adversary. As the perfect security at the cyberspace is not always possible, the project develops a resilient control mechanism to provide an alternative paradigm of protection by maintaining critical functions of the CPS and mitigating the impact of cyber insecurity on the physical layer. At the socio-economic level, the proposed CPS contracts aim to create an incentive-compatible secure provision of CPS services and mitigate security risks by incentivizing proper security management of the service providers and reducing the risks of the users. The research is fully integrated into the educational plan via the incorporation of new courses as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students via mentoring, participation in test-bed development, special projects, and internships at research labs. The educational tool will foster this integration via new hands-on activities and demonstrations to a broader community. With the aim to increase the participation of high school students, particularly women and minority students in science and engineering, the outreach activities include annual high school student summer camp, girls-in-cybersecurity mentorship program, and the development of educational short films and documentaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important objectives of this modernization is to achieve a high degree of supply autonomy of electricity consumers from their local electric power utilities, which is motivated by the need to ensure a higher level of reliability and energy efficiency. In practice, this supply autonomy is achieved by rolling out customer-end distributed energy resources (DERs), which include, but not limited<br/>to, photovoltaic panels, battery energy storage, and demand-side management solutions. If these DERs are appropriately sized and operated, electricity consumers are shown to significantly reduce, if not completely eliminate, their dependency on the electricity supply from their utilities. While this supply autonomy offers significant reliability and economic benefits, it also reduces revenues streams of utilities and undermines their financial viability. As a response to these reductions, utilities in many US regions have already started increasing electricity tariffs, thus further incentivizing remaining consumers to adopt DERs. This self-fueling process (colloquially known as the utility's death spiral) calls for urgent changes to the current US power grid architecture to integrate DERs in societally acceptable and socially responsible manner. The goal of this project is to design a peer-to-peer energy exchange platform that will manage customer-end DERs using the utility's network infrastructure.  Broader impact activities of this project include (a) graduate and undergraduate curriculum development, (b) summer research opportunities for undergraduate and high-school minority students via NYU's Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering program, (c) collaborative work with St. Anthony's High School in Melville, NY on new computer science course.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to fundamentally re-think and re-engineer the current US power grid architecture to accommodate a massive penetration level of customer-end DERs, while improving the overall reliability, resiliency, and energy efficiency of the power sector. The proposed solution rests on the following two ideas. First, we will design a peer-to-peer platform that will manage customer-end DERs using the utility's network infrastructure and decentralized, continuous-time control policies, which account for network physics and operating limits. Second, the proposed peer-to-peer platform will be coupled with an AC-power-flow-based energy management system typical for US utilities. This coupling will make it possible to design and compute appropriate network usage charges that peers will pay for using utilities' infrastructure. These network charges will generate an additional revenue stream intended to offset the<br/>drop in the utility's revenue caused by the roll-out of customer-end DERs. Based on these two key ideas, we will develop a multi-year planning model that will optimize the nation-wide transition to a peer-centric power grid architecture and fully harvest techno-economic benefits of smart grid technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conventional lenses collect light and concentrate it to a spot, but the concentration spot moves as light rays strike at different angles or different positions.  As a result, sensors and detectors can lose energy as a source moves, and the efficiency of an optical devices is often limited by the angular acceptance of a lens or lens system.  In this project, a collaborative team at the University of Central Florida and the University of Texas at El Paso will explore a fundamentally new approach for concentrating light called ""photon funnels,"" which is based on spatially engineered optical lattices.  Photon funnels will be designed to leverage an optical phenomenon called ""self-collimation"" to control how light propagates within an engineered lattice.  Using a collaborative approach that combines theory, simulation, fabrication, and optical testing, the team will develop fundamental knowledge that enables scientists and engineers to design photon funnels for a myriad of applications.  The benefits to society will include new technologies for imaging, optical detection and sensing, telecommunications and energy harvesting.  This interdisciplinary project will give research students cutting-edge training in optical engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, and design and simulation.  Educational outreach activities integrated with the project will bring the excitement of the research to the broader community and will help to improve understanding of science and technology and encourage youth to pursue careers in related fields.<br/>The research goals are to: 1) generate fundamental understanding of photon funnels and more generally self-collimating, spatially-variant lattices; 2) establish the fundamental performance-limits of photon funnels; 3) determine to what extent reciprocity limits their light collecting ability; and 4) create design-rules that engineers can use for their own applications.  Photon funnels are wavelength-scale aperiodic three-dimensional lattices in which the unit cells are spatially varied in orientation to direct light via self-collimation to a single concentration zone.  Because photon funnels work via self-collimation, they are not bound by Snell's law, so in principle they could collect and concentrate light incident at all positions, all angles, and all polarizations.  No existing technology offers this extraordinary capability.  Photon funnels and spatially-variant lattices are designed by spatially varying the structure of an optical lattices while preserving the self-collimating properties of the unit cells.  Spatially-variant lattices are fundamentally different from photonic crystals, metamaterials, and devices based on graded-index and transformation optics.  Spatially-variant lattices do not require exotic properties - like refractive index that is high, negative, or less than one - which makes spatially-variant lattices simpler to fabricate and inherently more manufacturable.  The project will transform how engineers design optical systems because they could set aside traditional ray optics in certain applications and use photon funnels to concentrate light.  Photon funnels and spatially-variant lattices offer tremendous potential because multiple functions can be integrated into a single device, including light collection and concentration, tight beam bending, wavelength separation, and control of polarization, phase, and power."

The research objective of this proposal is to address fundamental questions that arise naturally in network control theory from a probabilistic perspective. In particular, the investigators will address questions such as: how likely is it that a broadcast signal can control a large network. Can media shape public opinion. Can a single leader move public opinion from one state to any arbitrary desired state? The investigators will use state-of-the-art tools in probability and random matrix theory to study such fundamental problems.  One emphasis of the proposal is the synergistic relationship between probability and control theory.  To encourage and assist other researchers, the investigators plan survey works that will emphasis particularly useful probabilistic tools and techniques that one needs to address these types of problems.  Based on this duel relationship, many of the problems discussed by the investigators have the potential to lead to interesting new questions and directions in random matrix theory, which has many applications outside of mathematics including statistics, mathematical physics, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. The proposal also has several educational components including support for graduate study in engineering and mathematics and promoting participation of minorities in higher education in science and engineering.  <br/><br/>The proposed research aims to address fundamental problems and questions in network control theory using recently developed tools from probability and random matrix theory.  Specifically, the investigators plan to analyze the general phenomenon that most systems ""even those of a very discrete nature"" are controllable. One specific motivating example is the question of controllability for Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics on a large network. The investigators plan to analyze such systems by studying the case when the underlying graph or network is random.  To address such problems, the investigators plan to use and extend a number of diverse and involved techniques from probability and random matrix theory including analytic techniques (e.g. resolvent techniques, concentration of measure), algebraic tools (e.g. linear algebra), and probabilistic methods (e.g. Littlewood-Offord theory). Additionally, the investigators also expect the proposed work to be useful to mathematicians, as it will highlight precisely what types of problems and applications exist in other scientific areas.  Besides for the case of Laplacian-based leader-follower dynamics, the investigators also plan to address systems formed from directed and weighted graphs as well as a minimum-energy control problem for systems whose parameters are random."

Over the years, various physical phenomena have been utilized for measuring rotation rates. In optics, the Sagnac effect has been employed to develop some of the finest and most accurate tools for determining rotational speeds. In fact, as of now, free-space ring laser gyroscopes (RLG) and passive fiber optic gyroscopes are among the most sensitive rotational sensors built to date. However, despite their superior performance in terms of resilience to shock and vibration, ring laser gyroscopes are not readily scalable and therefore cannot be integrated on chip. Recently, a technique based on differential gain architecture was proposed to significantly increase the sensitivity of RLGs. The goal of the proposed effort is to investigate the fundamental limitations of this technique and to pave the way towards the development of ultrasensitive ring laser gyroscopes on chip. The project will provide scientific training for students.<br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that non-Hermitian degeneracies can significantly enhance the sensitivity of photonic resonant structures. One area where such sensitivity enhancement can become very useful is in ring laser gyroscopes (RLGs). In standard optical gyroscopes, sensitivity increases with the square root of the enclosed area. This behavior results in a fundamental trade-off between size and sensitivity. However, the use of non-Hermitian degeneracies or exceptional points for sensitivity enhancement raises several fundamental questions in terms of quantum noise, detection limit, measurement stability, and signal to noise ratio. The proposal aims to address these issues in an analytical and conclusive way and to determine the performance metrics for non-Hermitian gyroscopes. In addition, the design and fabrication of some of the constituent parts of the gyroscope will be considered. The proposed research may not only impact the technology of chip-scale gyroscopes, but will also advance the science of non-Hermitian physics."

Such network systems support diverse uses such as smart grid electrical infrastructure, homeland security, military applications, environmental monitoring, and medical and transportation advances. To meet demand, cellular providers need access to more bandwidth, which also happens to be their primary capital expenditure. By making better use of available spectrum in the 30-300 GHz, i.e., mm-wave band, providers not only could offer less costly service, but also could potentially make transformative cellular access and coverage improvements for current customers and the underserved. This project addresses a number of stubborn technical obstacles limiting mm-wave band use. To overcome these challenges, a multidisciplinary team will extend signal processing, communication theory, and electromagnetics knowledge to develop novel reconfigurable antennas and communication technologies for this band. Further, strong industry connections among team members will help facilitate commercialization. The project also includes goals to share a mm-wave testbed with industry and the public for remote testing, and to educate students at several universities--notably at California State University, Bakersfield, which primarily serves underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The project goal is to leverage the additional degrees of freedom provided by a new reconfigurable antenna design to establish new beamforming and beamsteering methodologies that overcome substantive propagation challenges at mm-wave frequencies. The project can also significantly impact electrical engineering, computer and information science, and the mathematical and physical sciences. Outcomes will include: (1) NEW ANTENNAS. The proposed reconfigurable antennas have various states, each with varying and predefined radiation patterns. Hence, they will support simultaneous transmission of multiple radiation patterns, each with large directional gain. The former provides beam diversity to overcome mm-wave frequency shadowing, while the latter reduces power amplifier design constraints; (2) NEW METHODS. More degrees of freedom will enable new precoding, beamforming, and beamsteering approaches to overcome pathloss, shadowing, and channel sparsity; (3) VALIDATION. Outcome validation on the Boise State University testbed will ensure that researchers can realize projected gains in realistic hardware and propagation settings at mm-wave frequencies; (4) NEW FRAMEWORK.

Controllable generators have managed supply-demand balance of power in the past, but this is becoming increasingly costly with increasing penetration of renewable energy. It has been argued since the 1980s that consumers should be put in the loop, with the idea that ""demand response"" can be managed to help to create the needed supply-demand balance. However, consumers use power for a reason, and expect some guarantees on the quality of service (QoS) they receive. For example, the temperature in a building or refrigerator must remain within strict bounds. Moreover, the behavior of some consumers is unpredictable, while the grid operator requires predictable controllable resources to maintain reliability. The goal of this project is to create a science for ""demand dispatch,"" which is virtual energy storage using flexible loads. A major outcome will be the creation of resources for grid regulation that are as reliable and responsive as giant fleets of batteries. By design, the impact to consumers of electricity will be undetectable in many cases; strict bounds on QoS will be maintained in all cases. The potential economic impact of these new resources is enormous. California plans to spend billions of dollars on batteries that will provide only a small fraction of the balancing services that can be obtained using demand dispatch. The potential impact of developing this methodology and associated technology is no less than a sustainable energy future becoming possible with the right mix of infrastructure and control systems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create virtual energy storage resources via demand dispatch to be used for grid-level regulation, ramping, peak smoothing, and even recovery from contingencies such as generation faults, while ensuring that QoS to consumers obeys strict constraints. Demand dispatch can only be realized by devising distributed control algorithms that meet multiple, potentially conflicting objectives: the grid needs high quality resources for regulation; the consumer expects that water supply is not interrupted, fish in the refrigerator stays fresh, and the climate within a building remains within desired bounds. The project aims to create a science for demand dispatch based on these essential ingredients:<br/><br/>(i) ""Local intelligence"" is required to ensure local QoS constraints are met, while simultaneously providing reliable service to the grid. This is realized through local stochastic control at each load as part of an overall distributed control architecture. <br/><br/>(ii) Capacity of service to the grid is a function of QoS constraints. The nature of these relationships will be investigated in part through the creation of prototype hardware. One outcome of these experiments will be the creation of load simulation code that will be used as part of the project, and shared with others working in this field.<br/><br/>(iii) Insight from cost/QoS tradeoff curves will be applied in the creation of market incentives for consumer engagement.<br/> <br/>Topic (i) presents significant scientific challenges. This will require the development of stochastic control / Markov Decision Process techniques that will be a focus of the project. Analysis is based on related ideas from information theory and extensions of concepts from the theory of general state space Markov models. Grid-level analysis requires concepts from deterministic control theory such as passivity, along with traditional power systems technology. The scientific foundations to be developed have applications beyond power. The proposed computational tools for constructing local optimal policies are novel, and applicable to general classes of stochastic control models. The distributed control architecture is also likely to find applications in many fields."

One of the most powerful approaches for handling polynomial optimization problems with rigorous and global guarantees is via algebraic techniques. These techniques form an exciting area of optimization that combines classical concepts of algebraic geometry with modern tools of numerical optimization. Despite their enormous potential, the applicability of algebraic techniques has always been limited by a fundamental challenge, which is scalability. In the first half of this proposal, the PI puts forward a new set of research directions that if successful can lead to major advancements in our ability to solve large-scale polynomial optimization problems. In the second half of the proposal, the PI brings ideas from dynamics and control into polynomial optimization. He investigates the potential of dynamical systems for solving polynomial optimization problems and introduces a new class of optimization problems where explicit polynomial constraints are coupled with dynamical systems constraints such as stability, safety, and collision avoidance. Efficient algorithms for these problems can have a sensible societal impact by broadening the class of applications in engineering and operations research that we can solve to global or near global optimality. These include design of complex robotic systems, verification of safety-critical software embedded in airplanes or medical devices, optimization of the power grid, control of systemic risk in our financial networks, and a more effective preparation against the spread of epidemic diseases. In addition to the research component, the PI's proposal has a strong educational component, which similarly encourages synergistic activities between optimization and control. Examples include the initiation of a Princeton Day of Optimization and Control, and a revamping of the early undergraduate curriculum in optimization to highlight the modern connections of the field with control and computer science. <br/><br/>A slightly more technical description of the project is as follows. The majority of algebraic techniques in polynomial optimization use the so-called sum of squares relaxation, which relies on expensive-to-solve semidefinite programs. By contrast, the new algorithms that the PI proposes dispense with semidefinite programming altogether. They instead work with linear programs and second order cone programs, which are intrinsically more scalable types of convex optimization problems. These algorithms inner approximate the sum of squares cone in a hierarchical format and with increasing accuracy. The PI proposes a number of applications of his optimization algorithms in dynamics and control, such as an automated construction of Lyapunov functions for verification of large-scale nonlinear and hybrid control systems. Conversely, the PI will investigate the potential of dynamical systems and Lyapunov theory for providing better local search and lower bounding techniques for polynomial optimization problems. Finally, the PI proposes an algorithmic study of a class of optimization problems whose constraints come from requirements on the trajectories of a dynamical system that initiate from a basic semialgebraic set. These requirements could include convergence to desired equilibrium points, boundedness, collision avoidance, invariance, reachability, etc. These novel optimization problems have an array of applications in uncertain and dynamic environments and their study leads to new interactions between dynamical systems, conic optimization, computational complexity theory, and convex geometry."

Visual inspection is a standard procedure to identify structural flaws and possibly predict the imminent collapse of a bridge and determine effective precautionary measures and repairs. Experts who carry out this difficult task must travel to the location of the bridge and spend many hours assessing the integrity of the structure.  <br/><br/>The proposal is to establish (i) new design and performance analysis principles and (ii) technologies for creating a self-organizing network of small robots to aid visual inspection of bridges and other large civilian infrastructure. The main idea is to use such a network to aid the experts in remotely and routinely inspecting complex structures, such as the typical girder assemblage that supports the decks of a suspension bridge. The robots will use wireless information exchange to autonomously coordinate and cooperate in the inspection of pre-specified portions of a bridge. At the end of the task, or whenever possible, they will report images as well as other key measurements back to the experts for further evaluation. <br/><br/>Common systems to aid visual inspection rely either on stationary cameras with restricted field of view, or tethered ground vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles cannot access constricted spaces and must be tethered due to power requirements and the need for uninterrupted communication to support the continual safety critical supervision by one or more operators.

Finding a low-cost approach to measure CEP would allow this fundamental parameter become widely accessible, hence opening up a new dimension in optical information processing, optical sensing and precision metrology. Second, CEP control is an enabling technology for the emerging atto-science and zepto-science. Accessing such short time scales requires the use of intense few-cycle infrared pulses with precisely tailored field patterns. Such a feat cannot be accomplished without a reliable method to probe the CEP. Current CEP-detection techniques, however, are prohibitively complex and expensive.

The workshop, co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, will take place November 8-10, 2017, at the Federal University of ABC, Santo Andre, which is located in the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The workshop will bring together roughly 100 participants including 25 speakers (from US and Brazil) and approximately 70 graduate students and scientists from Brazil. Infectious diseases such as visceral Leishmaniasis, malaria, and tuberculosis are endemic to several parts of South America, Africa, and Asia. Although there have been major breakthroughs in micro/nanotechnology based diagnosis for several infectious diseases, many pathogens lack vaccines or drugs. In such cases, early detection is imperative to prevent patient mortality. The goal of the workshop is to provide a roadmap for the development of low-cost sensitive detectors for vector-borne diseases by integrating biomaterials research and semiconductor technology. The proposed workshop enables a holistic approach towards the development and integration of low-cost diagnostic tools that will have a great impact on global health by involving researchers with complementary skill sets with Brazilian scientists working in areas of bioanalytics, biocompatible protein-based and other nano-materials, and US scientists specializing in semiconductor technology, optical, magnetic and electrical detection, and processes involving scalable integration of circuits.  New collaborative efforts between scientists from the US and Brazil are envisaged, paving the way for training students in bioelectronics, sensing, and diagnostics. Such collaborative efforts will open up opportunities for student exchange programs between the two countries, and the development of new curricula for graduate and undergraduate education both in the US and Brazil targeting low-cost biosensors in a cross-disciplinary fashion.<br/><br/>The proposed workshop will provide a unique platform for researchers to discuss the recent innovations, trends, and multitude of challenges encountered in the areas of new materials for biosensors, analytical tools, and integration of biosensing circuits using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor and other scalable technology. Although polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have become common tools for clinical diagnosis, they are not ideal for mass screening in endemic areas of a particular disease. The integration of semiconductor technology with biology is essential for the development of fast low-cost sensors. There are several challenges in integrating semiconductor technology with bio-interfaces. The workshop will address these challenges by focusing on new materials development, integrating electrolytic gated transistors, and seamless integration of microfluidic arrays incorporating different transducing mechanisms including electrical, magnetic and optical integrability. The multidisciplinary approach of the workshop not only advances basic science and technology in terms of materials development and providing new insights into physical phenomena; it promises to have a huge impact in the development of low-cost portable sensors which will be a game-changer for fast detection, and could revolutionize the mechanism of detection, clinical diagnosis, and improvement of therapeutic handling of several vector-borne diseases."

The high performance of these devices is enabled in part due to the use of high quality monocrystalline III-V materials and in part due to the coupling of multiple sub-cells that collectively allow for absorption of a broadband solar spectral range. However, the materials and manufacturing costs required for the development of III-V tandem junction devices is prohibitively high for use in wide-scale terrestrial consumer applications. As a consequence, the world's highest performance solar cells are limited to use in niche markets such as terrestrial high concentration and space power applications. A high-risk, high-payoff exploratory research path is proposed here that aims to provide an unconventional, yet potentially transformative nanotechnology-enabled solution to the above consumer market penetration challenges faced by state-of-the-art tandem junction solar cells. The project aims to dramatically reduce manufacturing costs by monolithically integrating III-V sub-cell composed of vertical nanowire arrays to a central silicon sub-cell, thereby simultaneously eliminating the primary III-V substrate cost-driver while cutting III-V crystal growth volumes by up to 95% compared to conventional technologies. The broader significance of this EAGER project lies in the potential realization of a low-cost and high-efficiency renewable energy innovation that provides greater national energy independence and clean power. This research also impacts and advances fundamental knowledge in science and engineering in the fields of physics, nanomaterials growth and characterization, nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics. Immediate anticipated societal impacts include outreach activities that promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics concepts to the general public, training new members of a highly-skilled workforce, and direct inclusion of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from under-represented communities.<br/> <br/>Technical:<br/>The technical approach of this EAGER project relies on selective-area heteroepitaxy of a GaAsP (1.75 eV) nanowire array on the top surface of a thinned Si (1.1 eV) sub-cell by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. A bifacial, three dissimilar materials, tandem junction device is formed via monolithic integration of a back-side InGaAs (0.5 eV) nanowire array. The vertical nanowires comprising the top- and back-surface arrays will contain radially-segmented p-i-n junctions and will be serially connected to the central Si sub-cell via epitaxial tunnel junctions. This design enables absorption of broadband incident solar energy as well as albedo radiation. Standard lattice-matching constraints are overcome via strain relaxation along nanowire free surfaces. Therefore, ideal spectral matching is realized without a need for graded buffer layers or dislocation mediation strategies. Use of vertical nanowire arrays with coaxial p-i-n junction geometries permits key advantages, including near-unity absorption of solar irradiance at normal and tilted incidence without the use of anti-reflection coatings, decoupling of photon absorption and carrier collection directions, and dramatic reduction of 95% in epitaxial volumes. Rigorous modeling of device parameters will be iteratively coupled with extensive materials characterization and property correlation experiments for optimization of III-V sub-cell structure on the single nanowire and ensemble array levels. The ultimate target of this work is demonstration of a functional bifacial, three dissimilar materials, nanowire-based tandem junction solar cell with one Sun power conversion efficiency of 30% or better."

Etching is generally described as the removal of a material to make a pattern and was first practiced by applying acidic solutions to metals centuries ago.  The advanced etching system to be used in these studies is capable of using gases to dry etch a wide variety of materials of technological importance, including silicon, other semiconductors, metals, glass, and plastic.  The information technology revolution has been fueled by the ability to make smaller and smaller structures in such materials, thereby increasing the density of computing power in a given area.  This research is critical for continuing to advance the state-of-the-art in nanofabrication so that the benefits of information technology can continue to grow and proliferate, by enabling advances in photonics, electronics, Nano-printing, materials science, and materials physics among other areas. The advanced material etching system will provide for a holistic teaching approach, consisting of the key steps of design, patterning (by etching), and testing, which will prepare students for jobs in the semiconductor, communications and aerospace industries, to name a few.

Semiconductor processing will be enhanced by the availability of spectroscopic capabilities that can enable atomic layer etching, while fundamental device research in two-dimensional materials such as graphene will also benefit; the system will further provide cryogenic etching for high aspect ratio nanostructures, crucial for organic electronics; the fabrication of  metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitors and sensors; microelectronics development for Internet-of-Things devices, as well as novel Josephson junctions and microwave resonators.  A standardized research training program will be established for students that will be based around the fabrication of optical ring resonator filters in silicon or silicon nitride; ring resonators are very common devices in silicon photonics.  An introduction to the optical background needed to understand the functioning of such a device will be provided, with the critical hands-on part of the work consisting of defining the structure through e-beam lithography, etching the structures with the advanced etching instrument, and testing the fabricated devices in established testbeds."

However, due to the short-lived electric current, these power generators are most efficient for vibrational energy harvesting at a relatively high frequency and inherently limited in the low frequency regime where every-day human activities such as walking take place. This research project aims to develop a unique type of mechanical energy harvester that exploits the typical configuration of the electrochemical cells in batteries and specifically targets harvesting low frequency motions. Such energy harvesters may work as auxiliary generators, powering ubiquitous computing, communications and wearable electronics. The project will also offer interdisciplinary research experience in experimental design, computational materials science and mechanics to both undergraduates and graduates at MIT and Penn State, as well as enhance minority involvement and participation in science and engineering, and stimulate the interests of students in the research field of innovative energy-storage materials and energy harvesting.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to uncover the underlying mechanisms of electrochemically driven mechanical energy harvesting so as to control and optimize power and energy generation at targeted low frequency through an integrated experimental-modeling approach.

Such network systems support diverse uses such as smart grid electrical infrastructure, homeland security, military applications, environmental monitoring, and medical and transportation advances. To meet demand, cellular providers need access to more bandwidth, which also happens to be their primary capital expenditure. By making better use of available spectrum in the 30-300 GHz, i.e., mm-wave band, providers not only could offer less costly service, but also could potentially make transformative cellular access and coverage improvements for current customers and the underserved. This project addresses a number of stubborn technical obstacles limiting mm-wave band use. To overcome these challenges, a multidisciplinary team will extend signal processing, communication theory, and electromagnetics knowledge to develop novel reconfigurable antennas and communication technologies for this band. Further, strong industry connections among team members will help facilitate commercialization. The project also includes goals to share a mm-wave testbed with industry and the public for remote testing, and to educate students at several universities--notably at California State University, Bakersfield, which primarily serves underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The project goal is to leverage the additional degrees of freedom provided by a new reconfigurable antenna design to establish new beamforming and beamsteering methodologies that overcome substantive propagation challenges at mm-wave frequencies.

Terahertz (THz) technology is viewed as a potential solution to this problem as it will enable devices that operate at speeds of 100 GHz to 10,000 GHz, far faster than conventional electronics. The project will create active THz devices using a relatively new family of semiconductors, organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites. Perovskites have recently gained significant attention because of their potential for high-performance solar cells. The basic properties of perovskites that make them attractive for solar cells also make them appealing for THz applications. For example, the response of perovskites to light can be altered chemically by changing the halide group in the molecule. Perovskites are also easy to process. High quality thin films of perovskites can be readily deposited via a simple spin coating process that is routinely used in the semiconductor processing industry. Different perovskites with distinct optical and electronic properties can be easily deposited next to one another. In contrast, this is difficult to do with conventional inorganic semiconductors, such as silicon and gallium arsenide. This ease of fabrication allows for new device capabilities that are simply not possible when only one type of semiconductor is used. The PI will work to broaden participation in science education through experiences such as the Utah Science Olympiad. The PI will develop classes for high school teachers, involve undergraduate and high school students in research, and engage with first generation students in the Salt Lake Valley.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The proposed work intends to develop a new class of terahertz (THz) devices based on organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites. These semiconductors, while well examined for photovoltaic applications, have been almost completely unexplored for THz applications. They are extremely attractive for THz applications because their optical properties can be chemically engineered with relative ease. Since they can be solution processed, multiple perovskites can be cast and delineated with extremely high precision in close proximity to one another, without any degradation to the material response. We intend to develop a unique fabrication technique that allows for patterning of these semiconductors with um-scale precision using a polymer delamination process that protects the deposited perovskite layers, while additional layers are deposited and defined. By doing so, we expect to create active THz devices that exhibit functionality that is not possible using only a single semiconductor, such as silicon or gallium arsenide. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate (i) ultrafast THz frequency agile devices, (ii) electro-optic devices using 2D perovskites, where the applied (THz) electric field can induce the Stark effect or quantum confined Stark effect in the multiple quantum well structures, and (iii) field effect transistors based that exhibit optical wavelength sensitive control of the THz properties. The proposed research offers transformative capabilities because the use of multiple perovskites within a single device proposed here is technically challenging to achieve using conventional semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, wearable biological sensors built on a mechanically flexible substrate hold great promise to enable minimally invasive, point-of-care human health monitoring. This especially applies to those who need constant care, including bedridden and neonatal patients. However, current wearable sensors only allow for measuring a handful of physical parameters, thus lacking versatility, specificity, and often sensitivity offered by conventional biochemical techniques operated in a laboratory setting. This research aims to develop a nanotechnology-based wearable biological sensor device platform that can be attached onto the curved surface of a mouth guard and enables continuous monitoring the concentration levels of inflammatory immune disorder biomarker proteins in saliva at high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This sensor platform could be eventually translated to wide clinical use to tailor the immune therapy blocking inflammation-causing agents in the body. Eliminating the long measurement lead-time and labor intensiveness that conventional clinical tests suffer from, the technology coming out of this research has the potential to provide the means to precisely monitor the immune status of an individual person, which meets the urgent need for 'Precision (or Personalized) Medicine' curing systemic immune disorders. In this program, the principal investigators (PIs) will collaborate with the Ecotek lab's Young Xplorer program in order to offer after-school hands-on research experiences in sensor nanofabrication to K-12 students. This program will allow the PIs to participate in conferences organized by Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics (STEM) societies, such as Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), Advancing Hispanics, Chicanos, and Native Americans in Science (SANCAS) Society, and Society of Women Engineers (SWE), to stimulate the interests of underrepresented minority students in nanotechnology-based biological sensor devices and solicit their participation in the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) hosted by the PIs.  <br/><br/>Cytokines are key biomolecules acting as mediators and modulators of the complex functional interactions and responses of the immune system.

The goal of this research is to establish an integrated device technology that enables continuous monitoring of the immune status by using a wearable label-free cytokine biological sensor. With the proposed study completed, this research will establish nanoscale device fabrication techniques required for strategically integrating structurally uniform, high-density nanoplasmonic biological sensor arrays and an atomically thin semiconducting photodetector device layer onto a mechanically flexible common microsystem platform. It will also provide fundamental device physics knowledge critically important to maximize sensor integrability, sensitivity, response speed, analyte detectability, biological/photo signal transduction efficiency, and versatility of the device under mechanical deformations on a curved surface.  The unique biosensing scheme used for the fully flexible device employs (1) biologically tuned nanoplasmonic light absorbance resonance shifts and (2) high-responsivity, high-quantum-efficiency photoelectronic conversion by two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) structures.  As a result, the proposed device is expected to enable label-free, continuous, concurrent, minimally-invasive detection of 4 key salivary cytokine biomarkers at unprecedented levels of detectability (limit-of-detection (LOD) < 1 pg/mL ~ 50fM) and response speed (< 10 min) in point-of-care settings. This sensor response speed is equivalent to a total assay time more than 20-100 times shorter than that of the conventional gold standard clinical test. This research holds great promise to develop the first wearable photoelectronic biological sensor technology based on the analyte-receptor binding immunoassay mechanism, which is broadly applicable to detection of a wide variety of protein disease markers."

Significant research endeavors are ongoing to explore its potential applications for drug delivery, tissue engineering, biosensing, diagnostic imaging.  Cholesterol is an organic molecule, an essential building block for cell membranes. However, the knowledge on the cell membrane and its cholesterol contents is limited due to the lack of methods to explore membrane cholesterol dynamics and its relationship with other biomolecules. Recent studies have shown that graphene can directly and selectively interact with cholesterol in cell membranes and subsequently modulate the cellular structure and function. In this project, the intermolecular interactions between cholesterol and graphene will be directly measured via dual-trap optical tweezers at the single-molecule level. Moreover, ultrafast graphene field effect transistors will be utilized to explore the dynamics and distribution of cholesterol in cell membranes and then engineer cellular structure and function. These fundamental studies will not only provide new insights into mechanical coupling between biomolecules and nanomaterials, but also promote future interdisciplinary approaches for deciphering molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cell membranes. . In addition, this research will be integrated with an educational plan to promote science and engineering to students of all ages and backgrounds. The PI will coordinate with Vanderbilt?s Center for Science Outreach to extend research impact to K-12 students, foster interdisciplinary education and training to undergraduate and graduate students, and encourage women and underrepresented students in engineering and physics. <br/><br/>Cholesterol is one of the most important lipid molecules involved in various interactions that shape the architecture and functionality of the cell membrane.

This project will develop a graphene-based strategy to manipulate cellular structure and function with high spatiotemporal resolution. The approach is to use dual-trap optical tweezers to bring a single cholesterol molecule close to a suspended graphene transistor to directly measure the binding force between them. Based on the fundamental knowledge of molecular interface between cholesterol and graphene, ultrafast graphene field effect transistors will be used to manipulate local cholesterol concentration in the cell membrane in a controlled way. Simultaneously, the cellular structure will be monitored via fluorescence microscopy.

Quantum technology is expected to play a decisive role in enhancing national security and bolstering further scientific discovery. In quantum information processing, single-quantum bit (qubit) operations are not sufficient to unlock all the computational power that is endowed by a collection of qubits. Hence it is necessary and in fact sufficient to add a two-qubit gate such as a controlled-phase gate to a finite set of single-qubit gates to achieve what no longer can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. In optical quantum computation, photonic qubits are used as information carriers due to their low-noise, long coherence times, light-speed transmission and ease of manipulation at the single-qubit level using standard optical components. To date, only probabilistic two-qubit photonic logic gates based on linear optics and photon detectors have been demonstrated. The implementation, however, is associated with substantial resource overhead and demands stringent technological requirements which are still challenging today. This project addresses the fundamental challenges by developing a deterministic controlled-phase gate to realize the full potential of quantum computation. The educational and outreach activities will train the next-generation quantum scientists and engineers to accelerate the pace of quantum information science and applications. <br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop a new technological approach to a controlled-phase gate for two photonic qubits using an entirely novel approach based on the generation of photonic dimer states, a chiral nano-photonic waveguide, and a single dipole emitter. The tight optical confinement in the transverse direction in the nanophotonic waveguide allows one to place the dipole emitter at the chiral point and achieve strong coupling between the photon and the emitter such that the scattered photons couple efficiently to the forward but not the backward-propagating mode. The correlated photons form the photonic dimers, which are the bound states of photons and give rise to a non-trivial transmission pi phase shift. The validation of the controlled-phase gate will be achieved using a novel experimental design based on an integrated waveguide approach coupled with number-resolved photon detectors. The demonstration of the photonic dimer state and the corresponding 180-degree phase shift associated with the state with both photons interacting with the dipole emitter will be a major step forward in demonstrating the potential of photonic quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The power electronic hardware is separated from the power conversion functionality, specifically the converter topology and control. The resulting VMP conversion is inherently scalable, reconfigurable, and increases reliability through partial redundancy. The VMP approach is expected to reduce engineering costs through modularity and reduce the converter Volt-Ampere power ratings through reconfiguration. In this project, VMP conversion is studied on an automotive drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities reduce the cost and add functionality. Specifically, case studies show the potential for a 20% to 30% reduction of the total Volt-Ampere power converter rating and the addition of onboard fast charging compared to traditional power electronic configurations. In a later stage of the project, the concept will be applied to smart energy home systems with renewable energy generation and/or energy storage, where similar benefits are expected. The power conversion concept will be evaluated in real-world conditions by two student-driven projects. The first application is a photovoltaic-powered irrigation plant in Senegal. This off-grid plant is enhanced with a battery charging station to make excess photovoltaic energy available for lighting and cooking. The second student-driven project will focus on a Formula SAE electrified drivetrain, where the reconfiguration capabilities of the VMP concept will be demonstrated. Both projects will be displayed in engineering outreach programs, for example in laboratory visits for high school students.<br/><br/>The VMP platform follows the computer science virtualization structure. The physical hardware platform is named ""host"". It features control hardware and the fundamental power conversion blocks, named autoconverter modules (ACM). The ACM are designed to be modular and can form power converter topologies, e.g., inverters, active front ends, DC-DC converters, or battery chargers. The resulting converters are named ""guests"" and exist exclusively in the virtual domain. The ""hypervisor"" is the fundamental software component that defines, manages, and controls the guests. Specifically, it allocates the power conversion resources (ACM) to different guests depending on the power and current requirements. The VMP concept is enabled by high performance ACM. The ACM consist of power electronic switches and filter components for simple parallelization. Hardware-specific details and power electronic aspects are abstracted from higher levels. The ACM will be implemented using wide-bandgap power electronic switches with a novel soft-switching technique that will result in modules with high efficiency and high power density.

Other 2D materials include boron nitride, black phosphorous, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Different 2D materials can be assembled one layer at a time into vertically stacked thin films. Such heterostructures can achieve functions and performance not possible with a single material. The interface between different 2D materials is critical to maintaining the unique properties that make them attractive for device applications. The principal investigator will use a newly developed clean-transfer method to prepare 2D heterostructure materials with clean interfaces. A custom-built scanning probe microscope with nanometer-scale light sources at the tip will be used to study the optical and electronic properties of devices with unprecedented resolution.  Results from this project will enrich the understanding of these materials and accelerate the development of nanoscale optoelectronics. This interdisciplinary project will integrate research into education of graduate and undergraduate students in material science, engineering, and nanomanufacturing. This project will also seek to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This proposal will combine novel 2D-heterostructure material preparation techniques, near-field scanning optics microscopy and near-field scanning photocurrent microscopy to investigate the fundamental optoelectronic properties and photocarrier behaviors in van der Waals material-based heterostructures.

Imaging such features can significantly improve the understanding and enhance the control of the electronic and photonic properties of this new material system. The objectives of this project are to: (1) demonstrate a prototype tapping-mode near-field scanning photocurrent microscopy to investigate heterostructure devices, (2) improve the spatial resolution of scanning photocurrent imaging technique to sub-10nm level, and (3) study the photoresponsivity of vertically-stacked heterostructures based on graphene, boron nitrides, transmission metal dichalcogenides such as WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2, and (4) develop fundamental understanding of the roles of nanoscale features, such as edge terminations and interlayer defect formation on the optoelectronic properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different isotopes can be distinguished from one another by the energy of gamma rays that they emit during radioactive decay. Efficient, high-resolution detection of gamma rays requires semiconductors with high atomic number (Z). However, these materials have low band-gaps and device based on such materials have high electronic noise. A high electric field in the junction regions of such detectors significantly increases this noise. Precision radiation detectors therefore require significant cooling to reduce electronic noise. The extensive cooling required can be both expensive and unreliable. The investigators propose to achieve gamma-ray detection with high energy resolution in a compact package at room temperature.

Currently, these applications rely on spatial light modulator (SLM) technologies that have significant limits: They are slow, costly, involve fragile moving parts, and not versatile enough to adapt to modern challenges. In this project, a material known as phase-change materials (PCMs) is used to create a faster and less costly spatial light modulator. This is done by combining a type of PCM that is commonly used in Blu-Ray discs, known as GST, with new types of nanofabrication and electronic control to create advanced reconfigurable photonic devices with performance metrics that far exceed what is currently available. The benefits of this project are three fold. At the core, this project falls at the intersection between two fields of research: nanoscale thermal science, and photonics. This will lead to an advancement of both fields in a new and unexplored dimension. On the education front, the project will allow for student exchanges between the University of Dayton and Stanford University, for the first time. It will also bolster the relationship with minority-serving institutes. The longer term impact of this work will be to provide a stepping stone towards providing compact, high speed, low power consumption devices, manufactured using inexpensive fabrication methods for use in technologies based on reconfigurable photonics. <br/><br/><br/>Current state-of-the art in light modulation for reconfigurable photonic applications relies on spatial light phase modulation via liquid-crystal on silicon (LCoS) or Microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems, both of which have major limitations. One current hurdle is the speed at which these devices operates, and the other is the complexity and low-yield of their fabrication process. The goal of this research is to use phase-change materials (PCMs) for coherent spatial and temporal control of light in a lossless, high-speed manner, well beyond the performance of standard liquid crystal and MEMs devices today. PCMs alter their optical properties (refractive index) through a controlled crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition, making them ideal for light modulation applications. However, two problems persist with PCMs: a) The phase transition is slow and b) the phase transition is binary (on/off), preventing the implementation of the necessary phase modulation devices. This proposal looks at both these problems and presents a novel and unified solution based on nanopatterning and temporal control of the phase-change process. Through the use of a new and scalable technique for self-assembled patterning, we alter the temperature dynamics and increase the speed of the phase-change by orders of magnitude. By using temporally-controlled electric stimulus, it is possible to achieve true continuous phase modulation of light overcoming the binary nature of the material itself. Phase-change materials, which naturally lend themselves to mass manufacturing, have the potential to alter the area of reconfigurable photonics and light modulation devices provided their full potential is exploited. This project aims to achieve that potential through a new collaboration between fields of engineering that typically do not see much overlap. Ultimately, the goal is to implement basic spatial light modulation devices, with unique engineered thermal properties, which presents a new cross-pollination of these fields, which could lead to further developments in both areas of science."

Such amplifiers have allowed for ultra-sensitive detection in radio astronomy (such as dark matter searches or cosmic microwave background studies), detectors with photon number resolution, ultra-secure quantum communications, and real time monitoring of superconducting quantum bits. Detection of low level signals, particularly at the single photon level is challenging, where amplifiers which have noise levels which are limited by quantum mechanical fluctuations are required for a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio measurement. In this project a novel traveling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) composed of a tunable metamaterial transmission line which will allow for efficient parametric amplification of a weak signal over a broad bandwidth in the microwave regime utilizing low-loss superconducting circuits is developed.

Limitations in these designs have prevented their wide-spread use and adoption. These limitations have to do with: phase matching, weak nonlinearities, and excessive noise several times the quantum limit. In this research program we propose to take an entirely different approach to phase matching in a TWPA. The proposed TWPA is composed of a metamaterial transmission line which will allow for efficient parametric amplification over a broad bandwidth in the microwave regime utilizing low-loss superconducting circuits. The metamaterial transmission line is composed of a unique network of coupled magnetically frustrated asymmetric superconducting quantum interference devices. The tunability of the refractive index (impedance) of the proposed metamaterial transmission line in situ allows for the nonlinear component of the refractive index to be tuned from positive to negative which can phase match a weak signal to a strong pump and result in efficient parametric amplification of the weak signal. The proposed TWPA is expected to deliver high gain (> 20 dB) over a broad bandwidth (> 5 GHz) while maintaining quantum limited in noise performance. The objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to fabricate prototype TWPAs (2) Characterize the gain, bandwidth, dynamic range, and added noise (3) Validate the quantum limited in noise nature of the TWPA (4) Investigate the performance of the TWPA in the presence of parameter variations (4) Study loss mechanisms in the TWPA which contribute to excessive noise."

Such media force electromagnetic (EM) waves, moving in the original coordinate system, to behave as if they propagate in a transformed coordinate system. Thus TO introduces a new powerful technique for designing advanced EM devices with superior functionalities. Coordinate transformations can be derived for compressing, expanding, bending, or twisting space, enabling designs of invisibility cloaks, field concentrators, perfect lenses, beam shifters, etc., that may bring advances to various areas of human life. Realization of these devices depends on the possibility of creating media with prescribed EM properties, in particular, directional refractive indices to provide wave propagation with superluminal phase velocities and high refractive indices in the normal direction to cause wave movement along curvilinear paths.  Originally, artificial metamaterials (MMs) composed of tiny metallic resonators were chosen for building transformation media. However, a number of serious challenges were encountered, such as extremely narrow frequency band of operation and the high losses in metal elements. The proposed approach is to use dielectric photonic crystals to overcome these major limitations of MM media. This project will allow graduate and undergraduate students, especially women in engineering, to participate in theoretical and experimental EM research.

For realizing directional dispersions of both superluminal and ordinary indices along desired axes of crystals, proper variations of their lattice parameters will be used. Accurate control of index values will be provided by building the media from crystal fragments with optimized dimensions. Microwave experiments using a parallel-plate waveguide chamber will be performed to record wave propagation and to verify computational results.   Technologies developed earlier for fabricating low-loss PhCs will help to implement the practical devices. This interdisciplinary research will integrate electromagnetics, physics, optics, and materials science concepts; employ full-wave computational modeling and design; engineer complex materials architectures; and master characterization techniques for complex structures.

High magnetic fields improve the signal-to-noise ratio in MRI, and are accompanied by increased RF frequencies, which can lead to propagating modes inside the bore with a patient. For example, at 7T, the required RF frequency is in the 300MHz range, while a bore that fits a human is at least 60cm in diameter, making it above the cutoff frequency for at least one mode of the bore viewed as a waveguide, when loaded with the body. The travelling waves can potentially be advantageous in terms of a more comfortable environment for patients, larger field of view, imaging to-date MRI inaccessible areas, and enabling new spatial encoding schemes and a variety of mode sensitivity profiles. It is important, however, to be able to design the modes in the bore for better excitation field profile uniformity and control of power exposure to the body.  <br/>Intellectual Merit: The principal goal of the proposed research is development of design methodologies for RF field profiles and associated cavity wall surface impedances and excitation probes, enabled by extremely fast and accurate full-wave higher order computational EM simulations of large body-loaded cavities. Several of the designs will be fabricated, characterized, and transitioned to clinical and research collaborators at Harvard University for imaging research. The specific issues to be addressed are: (a) Understanding the fundamental principles and limitations of radio-frequency electromagnetic field profile design for next-generation travelling-wave, high-field MRI; (b) Developing an engineering approach for modification of surface impedances in body-loaded bore cavities, enabled by extremely fast and reliable simulation techniques; (c) Solving the problem of proper field profile excitation (probe) design integrated with loaded cavity; (d) Evaluation and control of specific absorption rates inside the phantom, animal, or human; and  (e) Implementing the designs for several clinical and research MRI machines operated by collaborators at Harvard University (these implementations are not supported by the proposed grant).

Because of the potential to change the way medical diagnostics using MRI is done in the longer term, the proposal may be considered transformative in its nature. Multi-disciplinary education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, spanning areas of high-frequency analog circuit design, EM simulations, bio-EM, and metrology, will make an impact on two top institutions in the state of Colorado, strengthening the existing core competency.

Using a collaborative approach that combines theory, simulation, fabrication, and optical testing, the team will develop fundamental knowledge that enables scientists and engineers to design photon funnels for a myriad of applications.  The benefits to society will include new technologies for imaging, optical detection and sensing, telecommunications and energy harvesting.  This interdisciplinary project will give research students cutting-edge training in optical engineering, physics, chemistry, materials science, and design and simulation.  Educational outreach activities integrated with the project will bring the excitement of the research to the broader community and will help to improve understanding of science and technology and encourage youth to pursue careers in related fields.<br/>The research goals are to: 1) generate fundamental understanding of photon funnels and more generally self-collimating, spatially-variant lattices; 2) establish the fundamental performance-limits of photon funnels; 3) determine to what extent reciprocity limits their light collecting ability; and 4) create design-rules that engineers can use for their own applications.  Photon funnels are wavelength-scale aperiodic three-dimensional lattices in which the unit cells are spatially varied in orientation to direct light via self-collimation to a single concentration zone.  Because photon funnels work via self-collimation, they are not bound by Snell's law, so in principle they could collect and concentrate light incident at all positions, all angles, and all polarizations.  No existing technology offers this extraordinary capability.  Photon funnels and spatially-variant lattices are designed by spatially varying the structure of an optical lattices while preserving the self-collimating properties of the unit cells.  Spatially-variant lattices are fundamentally different from photonic crystals, metamaterials, and devices based on graded-index and transformation optics. Spatially-variant lattices do not require exotic properties - like refractive index that is high, negative, or less than one - which makes spatially-variant lattices simpler to fabricate and inherently more manufacturable.  The project will transform how engineers design optical systems because they could set aside traditional ray optics in certain applications and use photon funnels to concentrate light.  Photon funnels and spatially-variant lattices offer tremendous potential because multiple functions can be integrated into a single device, including light collection and concentration, tight beam bending, wavelength separation, and control of polarization, phase, and power."

Fabrication techniques that mimic biological nanometer-scale assembly strategies promise to transform modern electronics manufacturing by reducing the need for increasingly expensive lithographic fabrication equipment and facilities, decreasing reliance on toxic, rare-earth elements, and increasing the energy efficiency of producing and operating computational and communications devices. Besides advancing science and engineering issues critical to future device manufacturing processes, this project will provide educational and research training opportunities for students at the undergraduate, post-graduate and high school levels. This project will train students in the unique combination of biochemical and physical methods of modern nanotechnology that are relevant for industrial and academic careers. Through Project SEED (Summer Educational Experience for the Disadvantaged), high school students from disadvantaged economic backgrounds will participate in laboratory research during the summer months to become acquainted with the emerging field of nanoscience.

Such information would allow citizens to take preventive measures to reduce their exposures to air toxins, which would tremendously impact their health and quality of life. Mobile devices such as smart-phones and tablets represent a powerful infrastructure which could be leveraged to develop personal air monitors. However, traditional sensor technologies (such as electrochemical and photo-ionization detectors), commonly used for industrial safety monitoring, are big, power-hungry, and has limited sensitivity and life-time. The goal of this EAGER is to explore a highly-selective sensor architecture, utilizing nanoengineered gallium nitride (GaN) photoconductors functionalized with multicomponent nanoclusters of metal-oxides and metals. Innovation in photo-enabled sensing makes it possible to operate these sensors at room-temperature and resulting in significant reduction in operating power. The strength of this approach is that it uses all standard microfabrication techniques, for developing economical, multi-analyte, single-chip sensor solution. Due to the use of inert wide-bandgap semiconductor, metal-oxides, and noble metals, the environmental impact of these sensors during their life cycles is minimal. The proposed exploratory work will be done in collaboration with NIST and N5 Sensors Inc.  Future prospects of such low-power, small form-factor sensors include embedded-chip or plug-in module with multi-analyte sensor arrays for the smart phones for citizens and soldiers for acquiring real-time environmental information. The research provides  an excellent opportunity for a graduate student from an underrepresented group, undergraduate students,  and students from Thomas Jefferson High School of Science and Technology to work on the project using state-of-art research facilities at NIST and N5 sensors Inc.

One can view the field as the optical equivalent of microelectronics for integrated circuits.  The interest in integrated photonics is driven by the need for miniature, portable, and efficient optical communications, computing, and sensing platforms that are not limited by large scale bulk optics, discrete components, and long distance optical fiber.  Applications include the generation of light of different colors for precision measurements, the control of short optical pulses for high speed signal processing, and the modification of light color for low noise secure communications.  To create functional optical devices in thin films, voltages in the kilovolt range are required for a process referred to as poling.  Consequently, devices are static once fabricated by an external high voltage power supply.  The research program aims to reduce the required voltage to only a few volts.  Due to the low voltage requirements, static devices can become dynamic.  Optical systems once thought of as fixed and inflexible become reconfigurable and programmable.  Dynamic functionalities enable the realization of systems that utilize the properties of light to overcome the physical limitations imposed by electrons, impacting information technology, telecommunications, health care, the life sciences, and national defense.  The integrated educational plan responds to the challenge of linking science and engineering to problems of public interest by developing a classical and modern optics seminar series, creating new classroom modules for integrated optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking, and involving graduate and undergraduate students, underrepresented groups, and minorities in the research program.<br/><br/>A comprehensive research program is proposed involving theory, design, modeling, fabrication, and test to create dynamic poling of ferroelectric thin films for reconfigurable optical systems on a chip for the first time.  The objectives are to create microscale planar optical waveguides in wafer scale thin films of magnesium oxide doped lithium niobate with optically transparent poling electrodes and low coercive field, allowing for on-chip poling and programming of the spontaneous polarization waveform.  The design and modeling approach is based on numerical solutions to nonlinear coupled amplitude equations based on Maxwell's equations.  The chip will be fabricated at Ohio State University using nanoscale fabrication techniques.  A host of nonlinear optical phenomena with tunable center frequency and tunable bandwidth will be demonstrated.  New broadband and compact optical system architectures involving the convergence of photonics with electronics in integrated circuits are envisioned.  The research addresses the lack of second order susceptibility in silicon which is a major obstacle to achieving chip-scale nonlinear optics.  The program exploits the low coercive field of sub-micrometer thin films of magnesium oxide doped lithium niobate, strip loaded optical waveguides with micrometer scale mode field diameter, transparent optical electrodes, and on-chip heaters to reduce the voltage required for poling to less than five volts.  New horizons immediately become apparent when exploiting the capability of dynamic poling of the ferroelectric domains directly on-chip.  Instead of being static, the poling period becomes tunable and poling electrodes can now be considered as programmable.  Tuning the poling period results in the dynamic variation of the phase matching frequency.  Programming the poling into a linear chirp produces dynamic control of the phase matching bandwidth.  These concepts provide a new method of attack to achieve dynamically tunable nonlinear optical systems on a chip.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As device length scales shrink, pushing the limits of silicon technology, new atomically thin semi-conducting materials such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a potential replacement to silicon. While doping control has been perfected for silicon technology over many decades, controlled synthesis and doping strategies for atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are still in their infancy. In this project, the investigators propose to demonstrate a stable doping strategy for such materials which involves substitution of the transition metal atom by an impurity metal. The investigators propose to show how both hole and electron doping is possible using such an approach. This work could enable controllable and stable doping of transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets to tune their carrier type and density, thereby paving the way for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices constructed from atomically-thin semiconductors. To integrate research and teaching, the investigators propose specially designed interactive learning modules (virtual labs) which will be integrated into the curriculum at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Outreach includes demonstrations of the interactive modules to students and teachers from local area high schools; this will help to popularize science and attract underrepresented groups to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>There are very few reports of direct substitution (doping) of transition metal atoms in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides. This is likely due to the fact that transition metal atoms are far more stable than chalcogens and hence much harder to replace. However initial results by the investigators indicate that large-area (in situ) transition metal doping for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is indeed possible during the chemical vapor deposition growth process. In this project, the investigators propose first-principles density functional theory calculations over a wide range of doping concentrations to understand how the semiconducting and optoelectronic properties of such materials are affected by transition metal doping. On the experimental side, the investigators propose to demonstrate that the doping can be systematically tuned over a wide range. Variable temperature electronic transport measurements, using a back gated field-effect transistor configuration will be performed to establish how the material's electronic properties are influenced by doping. Further, photoluminescence and differential reflectance spectroscopy over a wide range of temperatures and dopant concentrations will be carried out to understand how doping affects the optoelectronic properties of the material. The project will culminate in a technology demonstration featuring an atomically sharp p-n junction device. To accomplish the above tasks, the investigators have assembled an interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise. Collaboration between experimentalists and a theorist will enable the team to develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying physics and make rapid progress towards controllably and stably doping atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide materials."

The gaps can be as small as 1 nanometer across and centimeters long with nearly any geometry, including linear, curved or closed loops. Metallic nanogaps with these dimensions have unique electrical and optical properties. When an AC voltage is applied across the nanogaps, a phenomenon called dielectrophoresis is observed. Dielectrophoresis results in forces that can attract or repel small particles from the gaps. In this way the gaps can be used to trap or sort small biologically-relevant particles for further analysis with optical or electrical techniques. By shrinking the gap between electrodes to nanoscale dimensions, the dielectrophoretic forces can be orders of magnitude larger than with electrodes fabricated with traditional techniques. Additionally, these gaps can be integrated into nanoscale transistors that incorporated 2-dimensional materials like graphene. These nanogaps interact with electromagnetic radiation ranging from visible/infrared light to microwave radiation. The nanogaps strongly amplify optically-generated electromagnetic fields, which can be exploited for sensing interactions between molecules in solution and particles trapped along the gap. By creating nanogaps that can simultaneously trap biological particles and probe them with nanogap-enhanced optical techniques, this project will enable ultra-sensitive chemical analysis. This project also includes educational and outreach components, such as the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students. The PI also maintains a relationship with the Science Museum of Minnesota and leads an annual activity station during the museum's NanoDays on the impacts of nanotechnology on everyday life.    <br/><br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The goal of this project is to design, fabricate, and characterize new devices with sub-10-nm electrically controllable metallic gaps that will enable a series of novel optical and electrical experiments. Atomic layer deposition will be utilized as a lithographic patterning method - atomic layer lithography - to produce electrically contacted metallic gaps with atomic-scale thickness resolution. Independent control of the gap thickness and contour shape allows for broadband and precise tuning of the electromagnetic resonance. The integration of electrical interconnects will enable new functionality of the nanogaps and a platform to demonstrate their potential applications. The nanogap devices will be integrated with 2D materials, turning the metal on either side of the gap into source and drain contacts of field-effect transistors and  photodetectors. These example experiments will serve to entice experimental experts to utilize atomic layer lithography technique and also use nanogaps as a platform for their research. <br/>Intellectual Merit: To date, most researchers rely on electron-beam lithography to create nanogap structures. While suitable for proof-of-concept experiments, these techniques make integration into more complex devices difficult, since they are places where precisely defined geometries and patterns are needed. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that the PI will transform atomic layer deposition as a top-down patterning method, thereby converting its precise thickness control into lateral patterning resolution without using electron-beam lithography. Electrical interconnects will be integrated to expand the capabilities of the devices. Example experiments in optoelectronics and nanoparticle trapping have the potential to make a large impact on the respective fields. <br/>Broader Impacts: If successful, the proposed atomic layer lithography technique will allow researchers the ability to create ultra-long single-digit nanogaps with built-in electrodes Therefore, this proposal has the potential to transform the fields of 2D materials optoelectronics.

Notable applications are machining micro-scale devices, imaging biological samples, medical diagnostics and therapy, and materials spectroscopy. Lasers generating ultrashort optical pulses are referred as mode-locked lasers. Today, mode-locked lasers are mainly based on solid state amplifiers and optical fiber amplifiers. In comparison with solid-state lasers, mode-locked fiber lasers have the advantages of stability, compactness, efficiency and low cost. This project is to develop novel approaches to making mode-locked fiber lasers generating ultrashort femtosecond scale optical pulses at visible wavelengths. Even though mode-locked femtosecond fiber lasers have many practical advantages, a novel pulse forming principle is necessary in developing one in the visible wavelength regime. Most mode-locked lasers shape pulses require that the refractive index dispersion, called the group velocity dispersion, and fiber nonlinearity work together. However, an optical fiber in the visible regime has a very high group velocity dispersion relative to the fiber nonlinearity that hinders the formation of pulses. In this project, mode-locked femtosecond fiber lasers will be developed by manipulating unique pulse propagation phenomena at normal group velocity dispersion to form ultrashort pulses. A mode-locked fiber laser operating at visible colors will be a valuable tool for medical applications such as general microsurgeries, eye macular degeneration, etc. Graduate students will be trained for careers in laser science and technology and actively be involved in the research project. An effort will be made to recruit diverse groups to the project and to provide them with significant scientific research experiences. Undergraduate students will also participate and be exposed to the research process. With this experience they may consider pursuing future careers in science and technology. <br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>Mode-locked fiber lasers operating at visible wavelengths will be designed using Praseodymium (Pr)-doped fluoride fibers by manipulating the self-similar evolution and the dissipative soliton propagation in all-normal group velocity dispersion lasers. While the main theme of the project is to generate visible wavelength mode-locked pulses, femtosecond pulse generation beyond the gain bandwidth (BW) limitation will be studied. A Pr-doped fiber has a very narrow gain BW around the wavelength at 635 nm, which is insufficient to support femtosecond pulses. However, by adopting self-similar evolution, pulses with spectra much broader than the gain BW can be created and much shorter pulses can be formed than the gain BW limitation. Visible wavelength mode-locked fiber lasers are relevant for valuable scientific applications such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and visible frequency combs. The successful outcome of the project will have a significant impact. The self-similar pulse formation technique can be exploited to generate ultrashort pulses at wavelengths where only continuous-wave lasers are available due to the narrow gain BW limitations. This project has the potential to extend the wavelength range of mode-locked lasers and to open the way for future applications."

Compact chip-scale sources of terahertz radiation that operate with both reasonably high output power (milliwatts or more) are desired for a range  of  spectroscopy  and  imaging  applications. Examples include molecular gas sensing in the field of astrophysics and atmospheric science (for example investigation of star formation), imaging in the biological and medical sciences (for example burn and skin tumor imaging), security screening and illicit material detection (for example explosive and drug identification), and non-destructive evaluation (for example corrosion monitoring, delamination and void detection in films and coatings). Existing THz quantum-cascade lasers only operate at cryogenic temperatures which requires extra cooling, larger size, and increased power consumption. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the development of a new material system for such lasers ""nanopillar quantum dots"" that has the potential to increase operating temperatures to room temperature by suppressing unwanted interactions of the electrons with lattice vibrations. The broader impacts are addressed at several levels including undergraduate and graduate research experiences, dissemination of results, technology advancement. Outreach to underrepresented minorities will specifically occur through the development of research projects for a course designed for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority engineering undergraduates. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in two innovative components: the use of nanopillar quantum-dots for intersubband cascade lasers, and catalyst-free selective area semiconductor nanopillar epitaxy of quantum dot heterostructures. Use of quantum dots to create discrete energy levels can dramatically suppress nonradiative scattering of electrons by optical-phonon. Hence, a terahertz laser based discrete states in quantum-dots is expected to solve a fundamental limitation of conventional planar THz quantum-cascade lasers, where non-radiative phonon-assisted relaxation prevents room temperature operation. In this proposed concept, carriers would flow longitudinally down the length of a nanowire ensemble in a cascaded dot-to-dot tunneling regime without coupling with two-dimensional states. Selective-area MOCVD epitaxy without metal catalysts will be used to grow high-aspect ratio InAs/InAsP semiconductor nanopillar arrays using lithographically defined oxide growth masks. Lateral quantum confinement is determined by the mask feature dimension and the presence of an InP passivating shell heterostructure; longitudinal confinement is determined by the axial heterostructure.

The goal of this project is to design, fabricate, evaluate and optimize the 3D C-NEMS based on-chip electrochemical aptasensors that deliver superior performance (i.e., high sensitivity, good stability, low detection limits).The PI plans to (1) fabricate 3D high-aspect-ratio microelectrode arrays with interdigital fingers by C-MEMS technique; (2) deposit carbon based nanomaterials onto the C-MEMS using electrostatic spray deposition and electrophoretic deposition; (3) functionalize the whole-carbon platform with active chemical groups for efficient and stable immobilization of aptamers; (4) develop and evaluate an electrochemical label-free aptasensor for PDGF protein detection based on characterizing electrochemical impedance and capacitive behaviors. 3D C-NEMS platform will have great advantages and is one of the best solutions to achieve high-sensitivity biosensors. Employing unique C-NEMS technique aptasensors can be fabricated repeatedly with desired dimensions, structures, and material properties. The miniaturized electrode design is geared to take advantage from the scalable relationship between the interfacial area and overall volume.  This project will contribute to the research, education, and diversity goals and strongly support FIUBeyondPossible2020 strategic plan. It will broaden the participation of minority students and women in science and engineering. The newly developed technique will be highlighted in the PI's graduate/undergraduate courses. Beyond the impact on the MEMS and NEMS community in academia, the proposed research will have broader impact on cancer diagnosis. The knowledge generated and the key issues identified in this project will impact a broad area of sensor fabrication and development. It is anticipated that the successful implementation of this device in the clinical arena will have significant impact on the early detection, morbidity, and mortality for the large number of patients with cancers, as well as establishing an innovative realm of biomedical technology."

Currently, these applications rely on spatial light modulator (SLM) technologies that have significant limits: They are slow, costly, involve fragile moving parts, and not versatile enough to adapt to modern challenges. In this project, a material known as phase-change materials (PCMs) is used to create a faster and less costly spatial light modulator. This is done by combining a type of PCM that is commonly used in Blu-Ray discs, known as GST, with new types of nanofabrication and electronic control to create advanced reconfigurable photonic devices with performance metrics that far exceed what is currently available. The benefits of this project are three fold. At the core, this project falls at the intersection between two fields of research: nanoscale thermal science, and photonics. This will lead to an advancement of both fields in a new and unexplored dimension. On the education front, the project will allow for student exchanges between the University of Dayton and Stanford University, for the first time. It will also bolster the relationship with minority-serving institutes. The longer term impact of this work will be to provide a stepping stone towards providing compact, high speed, low power consumption devices, manufactured using inexpensive fabrication methods for use in technologies based on reconfigurable photonics. <br/><br/><br/>Current state-of-the art in light modulation for reconfigurable photonic applications relies on spatial light phase modulation via liquid-crystal on silicon (LCoS) or Microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems, both of which have major limitations. One current hurdle is the speed at which these devices operates, and the other is the complexity and low-yield of their fabrication process. The goal of this research is to use phase-change materials (PCMs) for coherent spatial and temporal control of light in a lossless, high-speed manner, well beyond the performance of standard liquid crystal and MEMs devices today. PCMs alter their optical properties (refractive index) through a controlled crystalline-to-amorphous phase transition, making them ideal for light modulation applications. However, two problems persist with PCMs: a) The phase transition is slow and b) the phase transition is binary (on/off), preventing the implementation of the necessary phase modulation devices. This proposal looks at both these problems and presents a novel and unified solution based on nanopatterning and temporal control of the phase-change process. Through the use of a new and scalable technique for self-assembled patterning, we alter the temperature dynamics and increase the speed of the phase-change by orders of magnitude. By using  temporally-controlled electric stimulus, it is possible to achieve true continuous phase modulation of light overcoming the binary nature of the material itself.  Phase-change materials, which naturally lend themselves to mass manufacturing, have the potential to alter the area of reconfigurable photonics and light modulation devices provided their full potential is exploited. This project aims to achieve that potential through a new collaboration between fields of engineering that typically do not see much overlap. Ultimately, the goal is to implement basic spatial light modulation devices, with unique engineered thermal properties, which presents a new cross-pollination of these fields, which could lead to further developments in both areas of science."

Advances in light emitting diodes (LEDs), recognized by the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics, demonstrate many advantages over conventional light bulbs, including lower power consumption, longer lifetime, smaller size, and reduced environmental concerns. While in LEDs and lasers the focus is on the emission wavelength and intensity, their utility can be significantly enhanced by also harnessing the polarization of the emitted light. Akin to a preferred hand use in humans (left vs right), the polarization of light can display handedness (left vs right or clockwise vs counterclockwise). This preference is also inherent to many otherwise identical molecules and can signal different biological functions. The polarization-sensitive detection can be used for biomedical diagnosis, including an early detection of cancer. The proposed research investigates polarization control in light emitting diodes and lasers to improve their detection sensitivity as well as enable a much faster operation and lower power consumption. The principle behind this polarization control is the conservation of the total angular momentum when it is converted between different subsystems, such as carriers and photons. In a simple mechanical manifestation, the conservation of angular momentum causes the rotational frequency of ice skaters to increase when their arms are pulled closer to their spinning bodies. In light emitting devices the angular momentum of carriers is associated with their spin that is analogous to a child's top spinning in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Through transfer of angular momentum of spin-polarized carriers that preferentially spin in one these directions, the emitted light becomes polarized. The proposed work will provide a closely integrated educational and outreach efforts, as well as develop resources to study spintronics, including Spintronics Handbook: Spin Transport and Magnetism, 2nd Edition, co-edited by the PI. To address a deficiency in the secondary education in which a vast majority of public school students have minimal or no exposure to physical sciences that subsequently deters them from considering careers in science or engineering, the PI will organize Summer Workshops: Light Emitting Diodes and Lasers. The topics will include light diffraction, wavelength measurement, polarization properties of lasers, and modification of laser output. As a part of the annual SPIE: Optics+Photonics Conference, the PI will organize Symposia to bridge the gap between the spintronics and optics communities.<br/><br/>The success of practical spintronic devices operating at room temperature is largely limited to unipolar devices where spin-polarized electrons are responsible for magnetoresistive effects implemented in spinvalves. Despite their remarkable success for magnetic storage and sensing, such spin valves are of limited use for advanced signal processing and digital logic. It would therefore be important to assess if there are alternative paths to realize potentially transformative spin-based devices, beyond magnetoresistance.  Two paths towards superior light emitting devices are sought: (1) using conventional semiconductors and (2) using novel van der Waals materials that can be made atomically thin. In (1) it is predicted that silicon as the dominant material for conventional electronic, but with poor optical properties, could also lead to the robust light emission and thereby provide unexplored opportunities for silicon optoelectronics. In (2) an atomically-thin active region enables reduction in size and the emission of light is achieved at a fraction of the power consumed in conventional counterparts. In contrast to the common approach for spin-based devices that aims to increase the carrier spin relaxation time, it is predicted that short spin relaxation time supports ultrafast changes in the polarization of the emitted light (> 200 GHz at 300 K) and thereby enables ultrafast optical communication. Theoretical predictions will be closely supported through experimental collaborations to ensure their demonstration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even so, excitement is building, as many sweat electrolytes, metabolites, amino acids, proteins, and other biomarkers are showing promise for monitoring both mental and physical status and/or disease.  However, unfortunately many of the commercially available technology solutions that could be used for sweat require ~10's of microliters sample volumes, which are entirely too large for continuous sweat analysis. Even the latest patch or tattoo advances in sweat sensing technology require several microliters of biofluid, resulting in slow sampling intervals (10's of minutes or even hours). If one of the biggest arguments for sweat sensing is the potential for continuous monitoring, then there is a clear and pressing need to discover powerful yet simple methods to continuously bring the tiniest amounts of sweat (nanoliters) to sensors.  This is by no means a simple challenge, as the skin surface is highly variable and presents numerous factors that can confound sweat sampling. If such technology could be developed the payoff could be huge, allowing: (1) correlations with blood with as fast as ~2 min. time resolution; (2) for sedentary users, more sampling events per day of natural sweat; (3) for chemically stimulated sweat, a >100X reduction in the amount of chemical stimulant delivered compared to commercial products; (4) importantly, reducing confounding contamination coming from the dead skin surface. Clearly, improved sweat sampling is a central-challenge worthy of attention by researchers.  Furthermore, such a research topic is also ideal for cultivating and inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers through integration of research with both high-school and undergraduate student research and teaching.<br/><br/>The specific objective of this NSF proposal is to create for the first time, the ability to achieve chronologically correlated sweat sensing with minute-level resolution.  The proposal's central hypothesis is that through a clever interplay of microfluidics, the fluidic volume between eccrine sweat ducts and sensors can be reduced from ~1's of microliters down to 10's of nanoliters (10-100X), resulting in only minutes before new sweat reaches the sensors.  The rationale for pursuing this hypothesis is simple, sweat sensing has enormous upside potential for applications in patient and wellness monitoring, athletics, narrow therapeutic-range pharmaceutical monitoring, etc., but cannot reach its full potential unless lower sweat rates can be used, faster sampling times enabled, and analyte contamination from the skin surface mitigated. The proposal also advances knowledge in sweat sensing science by: (1) creating temporal models which predict the time for partitioning of ionic, molecular, and protein analytes from blood, into sweat, and onto the sensors;(2) advancing the frontiers of minimum biofluid sampling and sensing from the microliter to the nanoliter regime;(3  experimentally validating both the created models and technology, and therefore igniting further pursuit of sweat sensing science and technology."

These novel quantum probes, such as the Nitrogen-Vacancy center in diamond, can perform in conditions and with a spatial resolution previously inaccessible: they can be brought very close to the system of interest and measure minute magnetic (or electric) fields with nanoscale resolution. <br/>After the first proof-of-principle demonstrations in recent years, these sensors are on the verge of becoming transformative tools for the exploration of electromagnetic devices and materials.  To reach this goal, these spin sensors should be able not only to measure the magnitude of a given field, but more importantly its temporal and spatial correlations that carry most of the information about underlying physical properties. The goal of this project is to transform quantum sensors associated with spins in diamond into powerful spectrometers, able to detect spatiotemporal correlations of magnetic fields at the nanoscale due to, e.g., biological or magnetic materials dynamics, with a spatial resolution and sensitivity previously unattainable. Moreover, characterizing the noise spectrum is critical for devising effective strategies to counteract decoherence in emerging quantum devices. <br/>This project will combine expertise on noise spectroscopy and on quantum digital filtering to achieve an efficient and complete reconstruction of the noise spectrum via a quantum nanoscale sensor. The ultimate goal is to develop a new field of quantum digital noise spectroscopy, based on noise spectroscopy combined with the complete basis of Walsh digital filtering functions, and applying it to enhanced sensing of magnetic samples, and their structure and spatiotemporal correlations. Quantum digital noise spectroscopy with NV centers in diamond, also combined with super-resolution addressing of NVs, will be applied to nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging of biological samples and to measure spatial noise correlations of magnetic 2D materials.

Such network systems support diverse uses such as smart grid electrical infrastructure, homeland security, military applications, environmental monitoring, and medical and transportation advances. To meet demand, cellular providers need access to more bandwidth, which also happens to be their primary capital expenditure. By making better use of available spectrum in the 30-300 GHz, i.e., mm-wave band, providers not only could offer less costly service, but also could potentially make transformative cellular access and coverage improvements for current customers and the underserved. This project addresses a number of stubborn technical obstacles limiting mm-wave band use. To overcome these challenges, a multidisciplinary team will extend signal processing, communication theory, and electromagnetics knowledge to develop novel reconfigurable antennas and communication technologies for this band. Further, strong industry connections among team members will help facilitate commercialization. The project also includes goals to share a mm-wave testbed with industry and the public for remote testing, and to educate students at several universities--notably at California State University, Bakersfield, which primarily serves underrepresented students.<br/><br/>The project goal is to leverage the additional degrees of freedom provided by a new reconfigurable antenna design to establish new beamforming and beamsteering methodologies that overcome substantive propagation challenges at mm-wave frequencies.

The former provides beam diversity to overcome mm-wave frequency shadowing, while the latter reduces power amplifier design constraints; (2) NEW METHODS. More degrees of freedom will enable new precoding, beamforming, and beamsteering approaches to overcome pathloss, shadowing, and channel sparsity; (3) VALIDATION. Outcome validation on the Boise State University testbed will ensure that researchers can realize projected gains in realistic hardware and propagation settings at mm-wave frequencies; (4) NEW FRAMEWORK. A new framework for state division multiple access will use various reconfigurable antenna states and their corresponding known radiation patterns to serve multiple users; (5) EXPERTISE.

The broad scientific importance of terahertz technology is attested by the number of research programs and publications working to develop terahertz metrology techniques for a broad range of applications, including medical imaging, organic and polymer material science, and study of chiral molecules, amino acids and metamaterials. In particular, polarimetric methods will contribute to an understanding of physical interaction mechanisms and device physics in a range of applications. Our effort includes support for active dissemination of polarimetric capability to the broader research community. Moreover, this project is structured so as to enhance undergraduate and graduate research opportunities at the University of Washington, by providing training to student instrumentalists in terahertz polarimetric methods. Additionally, experimental results and research findings through this project will be disseminated in the form of guest lectures in a graduate-level course in Photonics. Finally, throughout this project, we will endeavor to identify and recruit female, disabled and under-represented minority students, at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  <br/> <br/>Polarization measurement and ellipsometry are essential research techniques for investigating properties of new materials in many areas of basic sciences, which also find immediate industrial and biomedical applications. Broadband polarization measurement in the terahertz frequency regime presently suffers from several significant limitations: (1) Current terahertz polarimetry techniques offer only coarse polarization resolution and small isolation between orthogonal polarization channels, due in significant part to (2) poor ability to calibrate THz polarimeters, as a results of high frequency-dependent power loss in external polarizers; moreover (3) current terahertz polarimetry techniques require rotation of external polarizers to pre-determined fixed angles and positions, which burdens the system with lower measurement speed and inaccuracies in rotational polarizer placement.<br/>We propose development of a novel broadband terahertz polarimeter that combines two recent advancements in terahertz source and detector technology: A. Coherent control of complex polarizations of terahertz waves generated in gas plasmas, and B. Measurement of sample-induced ellipticity and cross-polarization using a novel full polarimetric broadband terahertz spectroscopy setup. Integrating these two techniques, we will demonstrate a polarization-agile terahertz polarimetry system capable of investigating cross-polarization and chirality of a wide variety of natural and manufactured targets. We will in particular demonstrate applications of the new polarimeter in two important applications, namely diagnosis of healthy and burned mammalian skin tissue and characterization of photonic devices based on graphene and nano-stuctured materials."

While miniaturization of devices in recent decades has created many resonant micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) as new frequency references for making oscillators and clocks, major challenges remain in engineering ultralow-power, low-noise crystal oscillators by utilizing emerging resonators in new nanostructures.  This project aims to discover new science and engineering principles in multi-frequency self-sustained oscillators enabled by multimode resonators based on atomic layer two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, with a focus on previously unexplored effects and potentially unprecedented functions and performance.  2D NEMS are based on mechanically active atomically-thin semiconducting crystals derived from ""beyond-graphene"" layered materials that offer a spectrum of attractive electromechanical attributes.  Multimode 2D NEMS resonators are a new class of vibrating NEMS with intriguing and tunable properties rich in their multiple resonance modes.  With frequency reference and selectivity functions harnessed from multimode 2D NEMS resonators vibrating in radio-frequency (RF) and microwave bands, the self-sustaining feedback oscillators are distinct from passive resonators in that they possess their own stable limit cycles, and can sustain periodic oscillations without an external periodic drive.  The goal of the integrated STEM educational plan is to educate and motivate youth by (i) a new outreach program for K-12 students to understand oscillations and learn the fascinating history of clocks and timing devices, (ii) summer research at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) for high-school students, and (iii) actively broadening participations from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups, especially by extending outreach programs to public schools in Cleveland area.  <br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to demonstrate that 2D semiconductors can enable highly tunable self-sustaining oscillators, to develop the principles of 2D NEMS oscillator engineering and on-chip integration, and to explore pathways toward ultimate limits of crystal oscillators in the 2D platform.  This project will establish the fundamental principles of signal transduction and feedback mechanisms in 2D crystal oscillators, lay the foundation for ultralow-power and tuning circuit design suitable for 2D systems, and address critical challenges in small-signal detection, parasitic effect suppression, nonlinearity, tuning and power handling.  It will also explore phase noise in self-sustaining oscillations in 2D crystals at RF and microwave frequencies.  The research will be enabled by innovative feedback circuit designs that will go significantly beyond the simple sustaining amplifiers that are sufficient for single-resonator, single-mode feedback oscillators.  This project features a circuit-device co-design perspective, with the goal of eventually enabling entirely new, monolithic, multimode oscillators with phase noise engineering.  This project will create and establish a new branch, 2D crystal oscillators, in the rapidly emerging and growing field of 2D devices and systems.  The research will generate a plethora of new knowledge in both device physics and engineering principles that govern the 2D crystal oscillators, thus broadening the horizon of current knowledge of 2D systems.  The findings shall also lead to enabling technologies for 2D timing and frequency control functions in atomic layers.  This will contribute to establishing 2D electromechanical systems as a new pillar, in parallel to electronics and optoelectronics based on atomic layers, to support the future 2D semiconductor paradigm."

Near surfaces, the wake produced by this rotating flagellum produces complex forces and torques that act on the bacterium. This gives rise to a range of movements that depend on the orientation of the cell relative to the surface, as well as its rate of rotation and physical geometry. Understanding these interactions at surfaces is important in the study of individual motile bacteria as well as in the development of technologies that can controllably manipulate large micro-organism populations in fluid environments. The proposed investigations will take advantage of the unique features of an inherently magnetic bacterial species, M. magneticum AMB-1, of the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) group. Their natural magnetism allows them to be externally manipulated, providing a new means of probing the fluid-based forces arising near surfaces. Experiments that explore the role of cell geometry and orientation, magnetic content and flagellar thrust will underlie the development of models for the swimming behavior of MTB and associated fluid flow patterns.  MTB are also promising candidate organisms for biologically powered micro-actuation and robotics. In this vein, large scale cell assemblies permit several magnetic field-based devices such as ""living liquid crystal"" displays and bacterial ""conveyor belts"" to be developed.  The project will undertake outreach activities for several high school teachers in the form of an annual summer workshop. Through these activities, high school students will be able to create a connection between a fun, familiar device, an Xbox controller for example, and concepts in physics, environmental science, biology and engineering disciplines (e.g. magnetism, bacterial habitats, microorganisms, Archimedes principle) in the classroom and laboratory.<br/><br/>The realization of functional biology-based robotics at the microscopic level would introduce a paradigm shift in areas as diverse as materials manufacturing, nanotechnology and medicine. The proposed work will make major advances in this direction by investigating fundamental fluid-surface interactions of a model bacterial species (M. magneticum AMB-1) with innate magnetic properties. Together with micro-magnetic and micro-fluidics techniques, their magnetic organelles allow individual living bacteria and swarms be confined and guided  to yield quantitative measures of the hydrodynamic and magnetic forces as well as torques that are central to their dynamics. These quantitative parameters will serve as the foundation for developing models of their hydrodynamics on scales ranging from single cells to swarms. Integrating actuation and control of living organisms in low Reynolds number surroundings will serve as the basis to enable several novel biological and bio-hybrid machines that operate in a micro-fluidic environments. The in-situ management of the relative positions of individual cells through designed magnetic surface patterns provides for a novel means to explore pairwise cell-cell interactions that have led to the discovery of novel collective behavior such as rotating filamentary bacterial clusters, living liquid crystal magneto-optical modulators and momentum generating ""conveyer-belt"" tracks in these environments where viscous forces dominate. The flow fields generated by the propulsion of these flagellated swimmers will be managed to construct microscopically tunable pumps, mixers and hydrodynamic assemblers. The project will undertake stimulating outreach activities for high school students and teachers that link physics, environmental science, biology and engineering disciplines both in the classroom and laboratory."

The uniqueness of polarization signatures yields applications that span virtually all areas of science and technology, including materials characterization, chemical and biological analysis, remote sensing of the environment, and measurements of astronomical objects.  The state-of-the-art in optical polarimetry involves, however, relatively large and bulky instrumentation that lacks portability and requires extensive alignment, restricting measurements to the laboratory.  Miniaturization of optical polarimeters to the scale of a microelectronic circuit would transform polarimeters from large-scale laboratory instrumentation to portable point-of-need platforms.  Unique sensing modalities become possible for applications spanning real time monitoring of hyperglycemic swings, analysis of trace chemical compounds, and development of biotechnology relevant to food industries.  The societal importance of miniaturized sensor systems drives the focus of the integrated educational plan.  The plan responds to the challenge of linking science and engineering to increasingly global societal problems by developing a global scientist and engineer conduit, creating new modules for integrated optics curriculum that engenders integrative research thinking, and involving graduate and undergraduate students, underrepresented groups, and minorities in the research program.<br/><br/>Technical description: To date, virtually all sensing modalities based on spectral and intensity information of a sample have been miniaturized from laboratory scale instrumentation to the scale of a microelectronic circuit, except for optical polarimetry.  Optical polarimetry has not been accessible on the chip-scale because the sensing modality requires polarization controlling components such as retarders and polarizers that are implemented in bulk crystals or optical fiber.  Manipulating the state of polarization on a photonic integrated circuit has proven to be elusive.  To overcome this obstacle, a comprehensive research program is proposed involving theory, design, analysis, fabrication, and test to realize optical polarimetry on a silicon chip for the first time.  The objectives are to experimentally demonstrate an on-chip arbitrary polarization state generator and an on-chip arbitrary polarization state analyzer that are interconnected by a region that overlaps the optical wave with a sample of interest.  The approach harnesses the polarization rotating properties of Berry's phase in three-dimensional silicon optical waveguides.  Photonic integrated circuits will be created that are capable of generating and determining arbitrary states of polarization.  Polarimetric measurements of dichroism, diattenuation, optical activity, birefringence, and depolarization are brought to the chip-scale.  The design and modeling approach is based on polarization dependent coupled mode theory and numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations.  The chip will be fabricated at Ohio State University using nano-scale fabrication techniques.  A host of samples in the solid and liquid phases will be measured for the purposes of test, measurement, and validation.  Measurements will be compared with current laboratory scale optical polarimeters.  Transformational point-of-need polarimetric sensor system architectures in integrated circuits are envisioned."

Specifically, the structural mechanisms governing cubic phase material formation will be studied through a series of experimental characterization techniques aimed at identifying critical substrate-nano-pattern designs maximizing the cubic phase content. Concurrently, the radiative recombination dynamics of these (In)GaN photonic structures will be investigated and their structure-recombination relations correlated.

The laser is already integrated into our daily life: Among their many applications, lasers are used in optical disk drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners; fiber-optic and free-space optical communication; laser surgery and skin treatments; cutting and welding materials; military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed; and laser lighting displays in entertainment.   <br/>The laser produces bright, coherent, and tightly-focused light beams which consist of lots of photons (individual constituents of light). When measuring the arrival times of the photons in a laser beam using a photo-dector, the photons arrive randomly. Researchers have discovered that if the arrival times of photons can be orchestrated, these photons could have novel applications in quantum computing and communications that are not possible by using conventional lasers. A light beam that consists of these orchestrated photons is called non-classical light. Scientists have demonstrated the existence of the non-classical light. Nonetheless, to date there exist no efficient methods to produce bright non-classical light. The major hurdle is that although the scientists can coordinate a handful photons, it is very challenging to coordinate a large number of photons in a batch.<br/>The project aims to research a quantum light source for generating bright non-classical light. Specifically, we will design a quantum light source, and develop a computational framework to control and to manipulate the photons generated by the light source. Once completed, this project will make possible a new type of quantum light sources such that the output light of the quantum light sources will consist of  a large number of coordinated photons so that their arrival times at the photo-detector can be controlled. Such a new quantum light source will be important for practical applications in quantum information science. The capabilities for controlling quantum state of light are of paramount importance for modern society. The success of the project will represent important breakthroughs in quantum optical information processing, a field that has already broadly impacted modern technology and human life.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The capability of on-chip  generation of a large flux of entangled quantum photonic states (antibunched or bunched entangled photons) is necessary to meet the growing demands of a broad range of next-generation scientific and technological applications. Among these are quantum optical information processing, such as  quantum computing and quantum key distribution, and quantum (or ghost) imaging. In bunched states, the photons always arrive together at the photo-detector; while in the antibunched states, the photons never arrive together. A promising solid-state route to engineer the quantum photonic states is to use the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems that relies on the anharmonicity of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction. The PI has shown that the geometry currently employed in experiments - a single Jaynes-Cummings (JC) component sandwiched by two waveguides - have a fundamental tradeoff between high converting efficiency (from independent photons to entangled photons) and the quality of the quantum states (degree of entanglement), and  is sensitive to dissipation. Furthermore, the short lifetime of a single JC component severely limits the efficient generation of the quantum photonic states. It is desirable to have high-throughput quantum light sources; however, direct scaling up the number of the cavity QED components would not work, as the photons generated from different cavity QED component would intervene with each other at the output to wash out the intra-state correlations. The goal of this proposal is to computationally research high-throughput quantum photonic sources that produce high-quality entangled quantum photonic states to push the generation of the quantum photonic states well beyond the state-of-the-art."

In the year 2010, US already had 40.3 million people aged 65 and older (accounting for 13 percent of total population). The ratio is projected to reach 20.9 percent by 2050. In this research, a novel class of wireless biomedical implants will be investigated for sensitive, long-term monitoring of physiological parameters in human bodies, needed for managing chronic diseases (e.g. eye disease, heart failure, or brain injury), and for improving patients' quality of life. Battery-free implantable sensors have been growing rapidly in clinical uses because they have advantages of zero power consumption, potentially allowing for long-lifetime and maintenance-free operation. Nonetheless, one of the primary challenges for these implantable sensors lies in how to accurately and robustly detect physiological parameters from electrically-lossy small sensors using radio-frequency (RF) signals. The proposed parity-time (PT)-symmetric wireless sensor system will enable new ways to manipulate the RF interrogation between the implantable microsensor and the external reader, aiming to realize wireless sensing and detection with high sensitivity, high sensing resolution, and large modulation depth. The educational impact of this proposed project will also be significant. The integrated outreach program will be effective due to the visually appealing nature of micro-/nano-devices, sensors, and circuits. The PIs will develop new courses and outreach activities in Michigan Science Center and Wayne State University's established channels, including ReBUILDetroit Program and Richard Barber Interdisciplinary Research Program, for recruiting under-represented minorities in the Detroit area.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to experimentally demonstrate the generalized PT-symmetry theory in RF and microwave electronics, as well as their envisaged applications in high-performance wireless sensors.

A telemetry system with its equivalent-circuit topology obeying the PT-symmetry has not yet been investigated for biotelemetry and wireless sensing applications (13.56 MHz - low GHz). This new telemetry system, although having a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, may exhibit purely real eigenfrequencies that lead to sharp and deep resonances, with the effective quality factor (Q-factor) beyond limitations for passive systems, in which conventional loop-antenna is deployed as a reader. A sharp, narrowband reflection peak has been a long-sought goal for telemetric sensor systems, because of its substantial implications for superior detection and low cumulative noises. If successful, the proposed PT-symmetric wireless sensor system will resolve the long-standing problem of low Q-factor and limited sensitivity in wireless microelectromechanical and nanotechnological sensors, composed of inductor-capacitor (LC) resonators with miniaturized footprints. This proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge in biomedical implants, wearable electronics, medical diagnosis, healthcare internet of things (IoT), microwave imaging, wireless communication, and non-Hermitian PT-symmetric physics."

At penetrations larger than 20%, these fluctuations require high capacity energy storage devices that are environmentally friendly, reliable, and do not compromise the security of the national electricity grid. To address this issue, the current project introduces fundamental advances in the theoretical understanding, modeling, simulation, experimental characterization and development of Lithium-air flow systems for grid applications. The proposed systems are tailored to large-scale grid applications by being cost effective and having a high energy density and long cycle life in comparison with current electrical energy storage systems used in grid applications. The proposed systems will also represent an attractive technology for building low-cost batteries for electric vehicles, by having a design that allows fast fueling by simply changing the electrolyte with pure water and replacing the anode electrode.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to develop innovative Li-air systems that can be scaled up and used in grid applications.

However, the ability to improve radio frequency and microwave wireless functionality is inhibited by the platform-centric model in place today, where capability improvements must be achieved by developing new individual systems. Such improvements must often occur without increasing the size, weight, and power of the system, since increasing transmit energy, signal gain, or spatial diversity will result in larger size, aperture, or power, if not all three. This research seeks to break the platform-centric paradigm by investigating new techniques in dynamic distributed antenna arrays, where individual elements in a distributed antenna array use dynamics in time and space to significantly enhance the system functionality. Such dynamic arrays will lead to improvements of radar systems, enabling greater capabilities for sensing the earth and its atmosphere from satellites, improving target discrimination in military radar, and enabling greater safety on autonomous vehicles. In addition, the project will implement an educational plan for teaching new perspectives of antenna array theory and new antenna array design concepts. The outreach plan will educate under-represented student groups in engineering, both at the college and secondary levels, to help expand STEM education in central Michigan.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to explore the use of spatial and temporal dynamics of distributed antenna arrays to create new modalities for radar and remote sensing. In particular, this research will advance knowledge by exploring theoretical methods of formulating array concepts in terms of a physical antenna array dynamics with waveform dynamics, and will investigate new sensing modalities leveraging dynamic antenna arrays. Recent developments by the PI's group and others have led to dramatically increased connectivity between sensors on mobile platforms such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. Such connectivity and mobility set the stage for truly distributed sensing capabilities, where a new dimension of control and motion of the array elements can be exploited in innovative ways. This research will explore how spatio-temporal dynamics in such distributed arrays can be formulated, analyzed, implemented, and utilized to create new remote sensing modalities. Specifically, the project has the following objectives: 1) Obtain a systematic theory of spatio-temporal modulation in antenna arrays whose elements are dynamic in space and frequency. This will develop the foundations of a new antenna array theory that incorporates spatial frequency domain antenna analysis and spatio-temporal dynamics to open a new dimension of control enabled by dynamic movement of the array elements. 2) Explore the capabilities enabled by dynamic antenna arrays for new radar and remote sensing measurements. This will lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements in the angular resolution of radar measurements, and will enable the creation of new radar measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, new non-silicon thin film semiconducting metal oxides have gained prominence in recent years. They are a promising new technology for electronic devices, particularly next generation displays. Oxide electronics have high carrier mobility, allowing them to conduct current efficiently, and can be fabricated at low-temperatures. This makes them compatible with flexible electronics. Doped semiconductors are n-type or p-type, depending upon if the majority charge carriers are electrons or holes. The vast majority of thin film oxide semiconductors are n-type, which limits their applications to unipolar devices. The development of more sophisticated circuits using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology requires both p- and n-type devices. The goal of this project is to resolve the scientific questions that prevent the realization of high performance p- and n-type oxide semiconductors. This in turn will enable the development of low-temperature processed flexible CMOS inverters and other circuits. Fundamental device physics together with thermodynamic and kinetic considerations are the key components to enable in-situ synthesis of the oxides and fabrication of CMOS devices. The combination of fundamental materials processing and device fabrication has educational impacts in and out of the classroom at Baylor University. Low cost metal oxide technology is ideal for a prototype fabrication lab in an undergraduate course on electronic materials and devices. Strong connections between the PI and local industry will further enhance the value of the professional training experience for students. The project also includes outreach to local schools, such as The Annual Central Texas Science and Engineering Fair for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The recent development of several wide bandgap oxide semiconductors and the fabrication of basic thin film transistor (TFT) structures have garnered attention for applications in flexible electronics and high performance TFTs.  However, research efforts of these oxide TFT devices are currently limited to n-type oxide TFTs.  Recently, promising p-type oxides have emerged providing the opportunity to explore applications in oxide-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices.  The development of reproducible p-type oxide semiconductors and their TFT devices will greatly accelerate flexible electronics and will pioneer the development of new oxide CMOS devices. A simple binary oxide (SnOx, 1<x<2) is an emerging candidate for a p-type semiconductor due to the possible formation of ns2 hybrid orbitals.  However, the growth conditions for p-type SnOx are believed to be narrow, due to the formation of SnO2 (n-type) and the precipitation of metallic Sn.  This research suggests reproducible approaches to synthesize p-type oxide semiconductors at low temperatures (T) below 200 ?C.  Low-T (<200 ?C) in-situ synthesis of p-type SnOx (1<x<2) is a consequence of the thermodynamic instability of the metallization material in contact with SnO2.  The same metallization material must be thermodynamically stable with n-type In(Ga)ZnO.  This unique in-situ approach offers simple solutions to the complex challenges of synthesizing p-type oxides: the metallization of both p- and n-type oxide TFTs, and the low-T annealing processes (necessary for improving TFT performance). As a result, oxide CMOS devices will be fabricated in situ. This project also contains strategies for controlling hole carrier densities. The use of high pressure oxidation relates carrier density to the oxygen fugacity (i.e., effective reactivity), and the results will identify the defect-based doping mechanisms for p-oxides.  The information obtained from these investigations will be carefully correlated with TFT and CMOS device performance in order to understand the relations between synthesis, composition, material properties and device characteristics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NNCI Coordinating Office at Georgia Tech is established to enhance the impact of NNCI as a national infrastructure network by promoting its capabilities, facilitating user access to its resources, sharing best practices, and improving overall efficiency through coordination of activities of the individual sites. The Coordinating Office will assist users from academe, industry, and government in finding NNCI fabrication and characterization resources to meet their research needs through an interactive NNCI web portal. It will use the expertise of site staff to facilitate programs in education and outreach, social and ethical implications, and computational modeling and simulation across the network, and help provide linkages with other national and international nanotechnology resources. The overall activities of the NNCI Coordinating Office will contribute to the economic competiveness of the U.S. in training a globally competitive workforce and in providing efficient access to resources for innovation and commercialization of nanotechnology. They will also help to inform and educate the general public on fundamentals and advances of nanoscience and engineering and their social and ethical implications.<br/><br/>The mission of the NNCI Coordinating Office is to support the individual NNCI sites, site users, and broader public interests using the combined assets of a nation-wide network of university nanotechnology user facilities. A key component of the Coordinating Office will be the development of mechanisms for communicating availability of network assets to users of the facilities as well as for fostering interactions among the sites. A primary mode for this communication will be an interactive NNCI web portal, which will allow new and existing users to efficiently locate capabilities and expertise within the network, and also provide up-to-date nanotechnology resources to the K-20 communities and broader public. To emphasize the importance of a network of sites, the Coordinating Office will be guided by an Executive Committee with representation from all 16 sites and will organize a number of working groups and committees to address topics of broad interest and solve common problems. A flagship event for the NNCI network will be an annual NNCI Conference that will highlight the research supported by the individual sites, as well as provide a venue for site staff to share best practices and research trends with the broader nanotechnology community. An External Advisory Board with members selected from the external advisory boards of all sites will provide input on network management issues and future directions. Education and outreach activities will be coordinated across the network to share and disseminate best practices and resources for impactful programs at the local, regional, and national levels. Social and ethical implications programs, such as an annual retreat and conference forums, will enable social scientists to interact with nanoscale scientists, engineers, and students so that all groups can consider the potential impacts new discoveries might have on society. Computational modeling and simulation needs of the user community will be supported through an inventory of available resources and close collaboration with the existing Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). Assessment of the strength of the sites and the network as a whole will be determined through metrics developed in collaboration with the sites and will be based on site usage, site productivity and technical impact, contributions to the network, and education and outreach activity."

This objective addresses the growing need for continued miniaturization of sensors in applications such as medical testing, water and food quality monitoring, and security inspection. Moreover, such small-size sensors will enable their integration into existing and developing technologies, e.g., wearable electronics. To accomplish the objective of the proposed research fundamental science and engineering research is required. Thin filmVbased microcavity organic light emitting diodes (mcOLEDs) will be used as optical excitation sources; they will be integrated with hybrid, perovskite-based photodetectors (PDs). The mcOLEDs will be fabricated combinatorially on a single substrate, providing narrow emission bands (full width half max FWHM~20 nm). The emission peaks, produced by different active materials and microcavity dimensions, will range from the red to the near UV. The uniform dense array of such mcOLEDs, yet unachieved, will be integrated with two types of highly responsive perovskite PDs (an approach not yet explored): those responsive over a broad spectral range and those responsive over a narrow range. Bio/chem analytes will be monitored in two modes of operation, measuring analyte-induced changes in the (i) PL intensity using narrow-band PDs and (ii) PL decay time using both PD types. Developing both approaches will enhance selectivity and specificity. Importantly, to enable the advantageous PL monitoring where viable, the mcOLEDs and PDs will be evaluated and optimized to shorten the pulsed electroluminescence (EL) decay time and the PDs response time by fundamental studies of their relation to materials, charge mobility, layer structures and thickness, defects, and device design. The integrated compact sensors will be demonstrated for two array types: (i) those operated by monitoring PL for, e.g., O2, dissolved O2, glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and ethanol, and (2) those operated largely by monitoring IPL as in e.g., pH measurement and immunoassays, which are of biological and health monitoring importance. The approaches outlined in this proposal will pave the way to miniaturized analytical tools on flexible substrates, integrated with microfluidic architectures. Array designs, attribute optimization, the demonstrated applications, and initial exploration of flexible devices are expected to significantly advance the fields of organic and hybrid electronics and analytical methodologies."

Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology has shown that this form of graphene can be used to make transistors, which are fundamental components of solid-state electronics. However, currently graphene transistors are limited to non-digital applications because of a fundamental physical property of graphene. The research proposed here overcomes this fundamental problem using innovative modifications of graphene, thereby enabling graphene transistors to be used in digital electronics. If the objectives of this proposal are successfully achieved then graphene may have a significant impact in the electronics industry by providing an alternative to the ubiquitous silicon-based electronics. Graphene-based electronics may be faster and more energy-efficient than silicon-based electronics, and they are therefore of significant importance for society.   <br/><br/> <br/>This research aims to develop digital graphene electronics on a silicon carbide platform. The key goals are to demonstrate:<br/>(1) high on-to-off ratios in field effect transistors<br/>(2) field effect transistor switching speeds that are comparable to or exceed those of silicon based transistors. <br/>(3) low power consumption.<br/>The scope of the  research is presented below;<br/>For 5 decades, digital electronics has seen a relentless exponential growth in performance, but the growth will soon end, due to the physical limitations of silicon, on which the electronics industry almost exclusively relies. This ""end of Moores law"" scenario has been looming for some time, and no viable alternatives have been found. As first proposed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2003, graphene that is epitaxially grown on electronics grade silicon carbide is one of the most promising contenders to succeed silicon. This research aims to provide a proof of principle, by demonstrating that high-speeds and low power field effect transistors are feasible. <br/> The methods and approaches to be used<br/>This research builds on a decade of work at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the field of epitaxial graphene. In that time, high-speed transistors were demonstrated. Due to a lack of a bandgap in graphene, however, these transistors cannot be fully turned off and therefore they are not energy efficient. Recent research has found two ways to overcome this problem. One relies on the observation that a graphene layer grown on the silicon-terminated face of hexagonal silicon carbide is actually a semiconductor. If its mobility turns out to be sufficiently great, then it can be used for high performance digital electronics. The second method relies on the observation that charge carriers efficiently quantum mechanically tunnel over physical gaps in graphene ribbons. The tunneling current can be tuned using electrostatic gates to form ultra-thin body field effect tunneling transistors. In principle, this type of transistor is expected to operate at very high speed with low power consumption. <br/> The intellectual significance of the activity<br/>If this research successfully achieves its ultimate goal, then it has the potential to revolutionize the electronics industry and to kick-off the long awaited ""age of graphene electronics.""

M.<br/>North Carolina State University<br/>EAGER: Tandem Solar Cells of Two Dissimilar Material Systems<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Tandem solar cells are an approach capable of achieving a conversion efficiency higher than 45%. This approach involves stacking several cells with different properties for the optimum utilization of the solar spectrum. Currently all satellite and space communication systems are powered by tandem solar cell structures. However these structures suffer from several limitations such as cost and material related issues. They thus cannot compete for terrestrial applications which are currently dominated by silicon and inexpensive cell technology with efficiencies less than 20%. The goal of this EAGER project is to develop the science and technology to allow the high efficiency tandem cell concept to be applied to cells made from inexpensive material systems. We propose a new approach that relies on intermetallic bonding (IMB) to assemble two or more cells that may be composed of dissimilar material systems into a tandem cell structure.  This IMB approach can impact several different fields such as LEDs emitting at different wavelengths and dual wavelength photodetectors. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will gain experience in device fabrication, testing and modeling. Students will be part of research activities that can impact the national goals of renewable energy.<br/><br/>The IMB approach relies on the adhesion properties of indium (In) metal. Indium films will be deposited on the existing grid contacts of various solar cells. Bonding between the cells will take place by applying pressure at room temperature, resulting in In-metal bonding between the two cells.   The research program will focus on the development of the IMB technique, aligning the bottom contact of the top cell and top contact of the bottom cells, finding the optimum conditions for both mechanical strength and a low resistance connecting junction with minimum shadowing losses. We will investigate MJ structures from off-the-shelf bottom cells [Si (1.1 eV) or CIGS (1.0 eV)] and epitaxially grown junctions from the PI's lab for the top cell based on InGaP/multiple quantum well structures or AlGaAs to tune the band gap between 1.55 and 1.7 eV.  The above combinations can approach efficiencies close to 30%, in a two terminal device structure. We have successfully applied the IMB technique to bond GaAs/InGaP and Si/GaAs showing both mechanical stability and electrical conductivity. We have shown that the IMB offers a very low resistivity interconnects and was successfully applied to demonstrate the proof of concept in the case of GaAs/Si tandem cell."

Phase-change materials such as vanadium dioxide have optical properties that change dramatically at their phase transition temperature. Moreover, nano-photonic materials such as photonic crystals and metamaterials allow fine control over the thermal emission properties. This raises the possibility of designing materials whose absorption and emission spectra that self-adjust with temperature to minimize the temperature variation that they experience due to a changing heat load. Our technical approach will encompass fundamental theory, materials design, and experiment. We will use analytical models to understand the fundamental limits on passive temperature self-regulation in materials with engineered thermal radiation profiles. We will then use accurate electromagnetic models to design nanostructured materials with the desired thermal radiation profiles. We will make these novel materials using nanofabrication methods and test their radiative/emission properties experimentally. We will then test the material's ability to self-regulate their temperature. The outcome of this research will be an improved understanding of materials design for environments with varying heat loads.

These generators either work at temperatures below room temperature or are based on expensive and bulky laser systems. The goal of this project is to create a new type of terahertz generator that is compact, inexpensive and works at room temperature. These generators are based on readily available magnetic materials such as iron oxide and nickel oxide and will operate via conversion of magnetic oscillations in these materials into terahertz electromagnetic waves. The goal of the proposed research program will be achieved via a collaborative effort of a synergistic team of experts in magnetic device fabrication (University of California, Irvine) and leading theorists in the field of magnetic devices (Oakland University).   The results of the proposed research program will impact society in multiple ways. The new method of terahertz signal generation will help maintain the US leadership in terahertz technology.

In such antiferromagnet-based auto-oscillators, an electric current in the Pt layer injects pure spin Hall current into the antiferromagnet and drives its order parameter into a state of persistent precession. This precession excited by the component of spin current perpendicular to the easy plane anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is non-uniform in time due to the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy present within the easy plane anisotropy. The frequency of the antiferromagnetic order parameter oscillations is proportional to the injected spin current, and increases from approximately 0.1 THz to 2.0 THz with increasing current density in the Pt layer. The order parameter oscillations are converted into a THz electromagnetic signal with electric field amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm via spin pumping and the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pt layer. The dynamics of the THz-frequency room-temperature antiferromagnetic auto-oscillator is mathematically equivalent to that of a Josephson junction auto-oscillator, with the energy of the weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the antiferromagnet playing the role of the Josephson energy. The demonstration of these compact, tunable and structurally simple antiferromagnet-based sources of THz radiation will enable the development of compact and inexpensive solid state THz devices for imaging, chemical detection, wireless chip-to-chip communication and THz spectroscopy/microscopy."

A general requirement for future generation memory devices is size reduction, which can increase the memory density and capacity, a beneficial feature for virtually all applications provided the switching voltage is reasonably low. In recent research, we discovered memory effect in atomically-thin materials sandwiched between metal electrodes, an unexpected discovery in a standard vertical device structure. This represents the thinnest memory devices and can enable advancements in various applications including brain-inspired computing, information storage, and radio-frequency switches. For any use case scenarios, it is important to understand the basic mechanism behind a phenomenon. All the more important for memory devices in order to engineer the atomically-thin devices for a number of performance parameters such as the energy consumption and information retention. This research effort focuses primarily on this basic question of fundamental mechanism(s), which successfully accomplished can advance the field of memory technology, and exemplar applications, specifically radio-frequency switches. The effort will employ a variety of advanced experimental tools to elucidate the underlying physics responsible for this new memory phenomenon. Furthermore, successful achievement of the research objective will pave the path towards commercial development to benefit society in mobile technology.<br/><br/><br/>Atomically-thin materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have drawn great interest due to its diverse prospects in electronics and optoelectronics. Non-volatile resistance switching has been observed in various solution-processed multi-layer TMDs, including functionalized materials and composites, and TMD-based hybrids, where the resistance can be modulated between a high-resistance state and a low-resistance state, and subsequently retained absent any power supply. Recently, we discovered non-volatile resistance switching behavior in monolayer chemical vapor deposited TMDs in a standard vertical metal-insulator-metal device structure with stable operation under ambient condition at room temperature with low transition voltage, high on/off ratio, low ON resistance and good reliability. This discovery inspires new research on electron and ion transport in two-dimensional semiconductors and insulators for device applications in non-volatile memory, neuromorphic computing, and radio-frequency switches. However, the basic mechanism responsible for the phenomenon is not well understood. As such, this proposal effort focuses in one part to research a variety of experiments using advanced tools to elucidate the underlying physics. The tools to be employed include scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, conductive-atomic force microscopy, and temperature dependent transport studies. The other part of the research effort is to design the atomically-thin memory device for high-performance radio-frequency switch applications that will exceed the contemporary metrics for phase-change non-volatile switches.

In particular, the PIs have demonstrated ultraviolet (UV) photodetection with high gain in devices featuring a transparent epitaxial graphene (EG) emitter grown on a p-type SiC base epilayer on n-type SiC substrates. Ultraviolet (UV) detection is an important capability for military, industrial, chemical, and biological applications. However, UV makes up only a small portion of the daylight spectrum and visible light absorption can easily overwhelm the typical UV signal, making the inherent visible blindness found in wide-bandgap semiconductors (such as SiC) therefore a desirable quality for UV detectors if architectures with high detectivity and UV-transparent contacts (such as epitaxial graphene) can be identified. Accordingly this grant supports the development and study of Schottky-emitter bipolar phototransistor (SEPT) devices including detailed analysis using scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM). The devices rely on high-efficiency injection of minority carriers in Schottky-based devices, an unconventional process that could transform many fields of electronics from flexible displays for consumer electronics, to optoelectronics, to power electronics. For example, a graphene-emitter bipolar transistor will enable high frequency, high power, low loss operation of smartgrids, offering performance superior to that available from either traditional silicon devices, or the latest GaN or SiC devices, considered the gold-standards in power electronics. The physics of Schottky minority carrier injection would be transformative in developing hole-injectors for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), currently a challenge in materials such as GaN, enabling low-cost solid-state lighting, or in solar cells. The PIs are additionally committed to development of a diverse science and engineering workforce through graduate training and K-12 outreach. This project will directly support research workshops on solar energy and stipends for 10 students/year from historically Black colleges and universities in the Columbia, SC area, culminating in presentations at the USC Sustainability Showcase organized by Co-PI. <br/><br/>In most Schottky junctions, thermionic emission dominates, and minority carrier injection efficiency gamma <20% is observed, insufficient for high performance devices despite the potential high speed that Schottky electrodes offer. Results at the PI's labs on the transparent epitaxial graphene (EG)/p-SiC Schottky interface have demonstrated bipolar photocurrent gain bipolar phototransistor current gain beta >100 in response to 365nm UV radiation, indicative of highly efficient minority injection (gamma >95%). This behavior is hypothesized to occur due to i) the large Schottky barrier of EG/p-SiC (2.7eV), larger than the bandgap of many materials and ii) the large ratio of the mobility of the minority carriers (electrons) to that of the majority carriers (holes) in SiC. The ultimate goal of this project is to make EG/SiC Schottky emitter phototransistors that approach or beat UV avalanche photodiode performance ~102-3A/W (365nm) at much lower voltages (~10s V vs.>300 V), leading to lower dark current and noise. The PIs will use SEPT devices formed at the University of South Carolina to interrogate the transport of minority carriers at Schottky junctions using frequency, time, spatially resolved optical measurements, as well as temperature dependent DC measurements. The use of the only natively grown Schottky interface EG/SiC enables systematic tuning of the interfacial properties using H-intercalation, and by exposure to polar gas ambients such as H2O, NO2 and NH3, which the PIs will use to control minority carrier injection. They will also investigate the role of stacking fault formation under bipolar injection, a key aging process, as well as how stacking faults determine the responsivity, speed, and visible rejection of the devices. Finally, the project will permit continued collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory."

Of particular importance is the inability for further energy reduction due to the fundamental physics of how conventional transistors operate. Novel ultra-low-energy transistors could empower a range of new applications -- from long-lasting 'micro-dust' sensors and implantable bioelectronics to cell phones that last a month on a single charge -- driving a new wave of technological innovation.

Improvements based on the proposed research effort are expected to be significant in terms of energy-efficient electronics and of the quality of the generated oscillating frequency, which are both key features in modern electronic systems. The proposed work explores a new method to generate electromagnetic waves with stable frequencies with low noise and without wasting power. It is expected that the power necessary to provide oscillations is between one-half and one-tenth of that used by conventional oscillators design techniques. The other major outcome of the proposed research is an improved way to generate radiated high power in an efficient fashion, while being technologically simpler than other current solutions. It is known that high power generation at millimeter waves is notoriously challenging because single sources realized using semiconductors cannot provide high power levels. The solution adopted in this work is based on combining the power radiated by many individual radiating oscillators; thanks to a self-locking effect due to the degeneracy condition the oscillation frequency is expected to be pure, i.e., have low noise, and to produce high power radiation levels at a specific direction. Although the research is focused on exploring how to use for the first time the degeneracy condition in radio frequency systems, the acquired theoretical knowledge will also be useful for solving a variety of other problems, such as making highly sensitive sensors. The investigators will provide interdisciplinary training to participating graduate students through research; they will mentor undergraduate students in research fostering diversity in science and technology; and they will disseminate research to both scientific and layman audiences for the broad population to foster interest in electromagnetics and electronics. <br/><br/>The proposed research activity aims at providing first a theoretical foundation of microwave and millimeter wave (mm-wave) circuits that are based on the exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) in coupled-mode circuits and transmission lines. Second, this research will explore and implement various novel applications such as robust conditions of oscillation in distributed oscillators and spatial power combiners made of array grid oscillators. The novelty is based on the recently discovered physical phenomenon of giant resonance in coupled waveguides that support a degenerate band edge (DBE).  A DBE is a very special degeneracy condition occurring when critical coupling is established between two or more guided modes. This proposal targets two related outcomes: (1) Theory and demonstration of a novel principle of operation for oscillators in silicon-based technology, including CMOS, based on the DBE; (2) Theory and demonstration of a novel principle of operation of radiation by spatial power combiners made of arrayed, tightly locked oscillating elements operating at an exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD) present in planar coupled-mode structures. The new principle of operation will be theoretically and experimentally investigated at microwaves and millimeter waves, and compared to existing technology of oscillators and spatial combiners. The proposed research is expected to provide advantages in terms of energy efficiency, more robust oscillation in the presence of load variations, lower phase noise, and improved stability of the frequency of oscillation and radiation. The proposed concepts related to degeneracy conditions have not yet been explored or even proposed in the area of microwave or millimeter-wave circuits. Outcomes of this project may enable future generations of high-efficiency oscillators, distributed amplifiers, as well as novel grid oscillators, which are the backbone of any communication system at microwave and mm-waves."

Optical devices operating in the mid-infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (3-30 microns) enable sensitive imaging and detection because many molecules exhibit specific and strong absorption spectra at these wavelengths.  One of the primary challenges of developing mid-infrared sources for these applications is that the physical process that generates light is very inefficient.  Our approach to improving the efficiency of mid-infrared optical sources is to engineer strong quantum mechanical interactions between light and matter, creating quantum states that are simultaneously light and matter excitations, and to study these hybrid states when the device is electrically pumped.  In doing so, our desire is to develop a set of tools for these optoelectronic devices by demonstrating techniques for engineering, fabricating, characterizing, and controlling devices that incorporate strong light-matter interactions.  Beyond advancing mid-infrared technologies, this program also addresses education and diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by developing and hosting Engineering Days that are built around hands-on optics-based challenges for students at local schools.<br/><br/>This program aims to improve the radiative quantum efficiency of mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.  However, far from incremental improvements to existing devices such a quantum cascade lasers, our approach seeks the development of fundamentally new devices based on electrically injected polariton states that arise from strong light-matter interactions between the photon field in a resonator and electronic intersubband transitions between the quantized states of quantum wells integrated into the resonator.  These novel optoelectronic devices will provide a new approach for wide-bandwidth, high-power incoherent sources needed for applications in mid-infrared sensing and imaging.  Our approach is an integrated theoretical, computational, and experimental effort to (1) investigate mid-infrared microcavities, (2) improve coupling of photons with mid-infrared intersubband transitions, and (3) implement efficient electrical injection of intersubband polariton states.  We will investigate a range of cavity and conduction band designs in both GaAs- and InP-based material systems.  All of our materials will be grown by molecular beam epitaxy and fabricated into devices in a state-of-the-art nanofabrication facility.  We will characterize the devices using Fourier transform spectroscopy as a function of temperature, resonator and conduction band design, and electrical pumping power.  Our efforts will lay the groundwork for integrating mid-infrared intersubband polaritons into optoelectronic devices.  Furthermore, efficient electrical injection of intersubband polariton states will also benefit the development of ultra-tunable quantum cascade lasers, while the investigation of the limits of light-matter coupling will be of interest to the mid-infrared detector and quantum optics communities.  The end result of this program is ambitious: the development of electrically injected intersubband polariton emitters with more than four orders of magnitude improvement in the emitted power and efficiency compared to existing mid-infrared intersubband emitters."

The research involves two main thrust areas: (1) device-level demonstration of ultra-sensitive, low-noise heterostructure interband tunneling-based detectors, and (2) system-level demonstration of prototype antenna-coupled detectors and imaging arrays.  The devices being explored promise noise levels more than 30 times lower than conventional approaches.  This much lower noise allows systems to be greatly simplified, leading to much lower size, weight, and cost, and enabling practical implementation and exploitation of millimeter-wave and THz imaging in cost-sensitive commercial and civilian applications.  The project will also produce prototype imaging arrays offering spectroscopic and polarization sensitivity, allowing more than just ""grayscale"" imaging.  This enhanced functionality is valuable for material identification and characterization, as well as to provide the ability to discriminate among similar substances and objects in imaging applications.  The project provides significant educational opportunities for students from high school science and technology outreach through graduate-level research opportunities.  <br/><br/>The project features an interdisciplinary approach, with effort in both device design and optimization as well as imaging array and system design.  This approach ensures that the devices developed serve the needs of the system architectures, and the system architectures can be tailored to fully tap the potential of devices.  Two emerging device technologies will be explored: heterostructure backward diodes (HBDs) and tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs); using interband tunneling to generate the detectors? second-order nonlinearity provides significant advantages in terms of sensitivity and noise performance; the sensitivity can exceed the fundamental limits imposed by thermionic emission in Schottky and field-effect transistor (FET) detectors, while operating with zero applied bias for low flicker (1/f) noise and high sensitivity.

Simulations indicate that noise equivalent power (NEP) of 0.05 pW/Hz1/2 and below should be possible to achieve.  Through device design improvements (i.e., modifications to the epitaxial wafer structure, focusing on novel stepped-barrier designs) and scaling (reduction in critical lateral dimensions through advanced fabrication processing), devices with operational frequencies well into the THz will be demonstrated.  Imaging arrays with frequency tuning capability (implemented with varactive tuning of planar annular slot antennas) and polarization discrimination (also using loaded annular slot antennas) will be prototyped and assessed to validate the performance of the detectors for imaging applications.

The intellectual impact includes advancing the understanding of device designs for leveraging interband tunneling for millimeter-wave and THz detection, as well as imaging array architectures and approaches to spectroscopic and polarization-resolved imaging in this frequency regime.

A long-standing objective of THz technology research has been to develop a multi-pixel THz ""camera"" that can produce images of the THz radiation from an object, similar to the commonly-used digital cameras that take pictures with visible light. Because of the limited sensitivity and speed for typical room temperature devices, THz imaging presently requires the use of a high power, coherent, THz illumination source. Meticulously engineered THz detectors can reach high sensitivity and fast speed. However such devices typically need to be cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. Here graphene, a single atomic sheet of carbon atoms, will be used to make compact and high performance THz detectors operating at room temperature. Specifically graphene will be processed into a thermocouple that can rapidly and efficiently sense the heating effects due to THz radiation absorption. Fully optimized devices from the project are expected to reach a performance equivalent to existing systems that have to be cooled down with liquid helium, paving way for developing a compact room temperature THz camera that can record thermal images of the environment without the need for an intense THz light source.

The proposed research seeks to take advantage of these unique properties and fabricate high quality graphene-boron nitride atomic stacks to detect THz radiation through a thermoelectric mechanism: THz radiation heats up electrons in graphene while keeping the lattice in thermal equilibrium with the environment; the diffusion of hot electrons creates a temperature gradient which, in a device with broken mirror symmetry, generates a thermoelectric voltage signal. This detection mechanism can effectively circumvent performance roll off at high THz frequencies, commonly encountered in gallium arsenide Schottky barrier diode and semiconductor plasmon detectors, and provide very fast response due to graphene?s small electron heat capacity. The THz detectors will be coupled to the incoming radiation through an integrated circuit antenna and a silicon lens. The project will develop: 1. graphene thermoelectric direct detectors with high responsivity, fast speed and low noise equivalent power; 2. graphene thermoelectric heterodyne detectors reaching high sensitivity with low local oscillator power requirement and room temperature operation.

In order to handle the ever-growing size, complexity, and heterogeneity of the mathematical problems resulting from power system expansion and evolution, and to conduct rapid and accurate power system analyses especially with the aid of advanced computing techniques, the project team envisions a new concept of ""Smart Partitioning"" as an innovative decomposition method to enhance the analysis of large-scale and complex power systems by leveraging a high performance parallel computing platform. The research will systematically explore this novel domain decomposition concept in terms of problem modeling, solution algorithms and computational implementation to transform how steady state and dynamic large-scale power system analyses are efficiently performed on a high performance parallel computing platform. The research will help expedite the proliferation of applications based on the high-performance parallel computing platform to enhance the economics, reliability and stability of electric power systems and accelerate the development and deployment of other smart grid technologies. As an integral part of this project, the educational plan focuses on power system applications on high-performance parallel computing technology and emphasizes how the knowledge and results gained from the research can be directly channeled into the project's education goals via standard academic means, stimulate students' interest in large-scale power system studies, and empower industry engineers with skills for life-long learning.<br/><br/>The proposed smart partitioning based decomposition method could revolutionize power system analysis by constructing a virtual domain based, flexible, scalable, and efficient partitioning structure, and utilizing parallel optimization science and parallel computing techniques to tame the size and computational difficulty of large-scale power system analysis problems. The proposed power system decomposition will no longer need to be formulated around one particular domain like functions, scenarios, geographical areas or time. Instead, it can be made based on one or a set of virtual domains to fully exploit the inherent structures, physical coherency, component characteristics and unique properties of the power system. The proposed smart partition strategies have distinct and unique attributes that are consistent with the objectives of modern power system analysis, including flexibility and extensibility of the modeling, scalability and parallelism of the algorithms, and efficiency and usability of the computations. The key research tasks include (1) developing virtual domain decomposition based flexible modeling for both steady state and dynamic analyses of the power system composed of heterogeneous types of power production and delivery elements; (2) exploring scalable and effective parallel computing algorithms that process the proposed power system studies in a fully parallel manner and optimize the information interactions among calculation tasks; and (3) implementing efficient and rapid high-performance parallel computations that optimally map the computation tasks to processors and balance the arrangement of tasks."

Novel integration approaches that combine innovations at all levels of material, device, and packaging of power electronic devices are necessary.

One potential solution is to use spin rather than charge to store and process information. The dual capabilities of spintronics in logic and memory will be used to address the ""memory wall"" in two tasks: first by reducing memory write times from ~10ns to 1-10ps, and second by incorporating some logical functions directly within memory arrays.

While there are numerous commerically available bioassays available to detect this molecule with requisite sensitivity and specificity, these tests are time consuming and require specially trained personnel.

Compared to conventional nanofabrication processes, nanoscale-printing potentially requires less energy, relies on inexpensive processing tools and generate less waste. A multidisciplinary team will mold responsive shape-memory polymers into patterned surfaces and relate interfacial adhesion to surface microstructure, bulk mechanical properties, and contact load and temperature history. By optimizing the surface's ability to switch adhesion, research could also enable transformative technologies including flow-switchable micro-fluidics, switchable medical adhesives, cell culture and tissue growth templates, and simplified demanufacture of intricate devices to recover materials for recycle or reuse. With an improved understanding of how shape-memory controls material transfer, investigators will optimize printing parameters to obtain robust transfer of inorganic and organic thin films on a large scale. To conclude the project, researchers will team with an industrial partner (eMagin) to apply shape-memory contact printing by manufacturing working organic light emitting diode microdisplays. Undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups, will take part in intense, modular research experiences that are designed to cycle through the entire scientific loop. An innovative pedagogical approach to engineering education will be explored by integrating research activities into university courses including a team-taught course on nanomanufacturing. Project activities will enhance manufacturing skills of students entering the workforce by providing them multidisciplinary educational experiences in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and chemistry.<br/><br/>This technical goal of this project is to develop a scalable nanomanufacturing platform for cost effective, high-resolution additive printing of patterned organic and inorganic thin films.  Current elastomer-based contact printing primarily relies on rate modulation to control adhesion and fracture at the stamp-substrate interface. However, rate modulation must be optimized for each ink-substrate-stamp system, and it remains challenging to adapt such processes to meso- and nanoscale patterns. In this project, researchers will utilize responsive shape-memory polymer networks that are molded into patterned surfaces to enable switchable topography and adhesion for precise pick-up and delivery of small portions of materials down to sub-100 nm dimensions. The stamp's mechanical properties and surface structures will be designed to undergo heat-triggered topographical changes, thereby imparting a change to the surface's adhesive properties. Research aims are: (1) to identify shape-memory polymers with switchable mechanical properties and tunable surface energies for use as contact-printing stamps; (2) to use patterned shape-memory stamps with well-defined features and arrays of features to perform, model, and optimize topographical switching, interfacial adhesion and material transfer, (3) to conduct physical, chemical, and mechanical characterization of features and surfaces that have experienced thermomechanical stresses, and (4) to demonstrate additive contact printing of thin films into clean, defect-free and high resolution organic light emitting diode arrays. Unlike other patterning methods, shape-memory contact printing makes efficient use of printed material, is scalable to large-area and flexible substrates, and is not limited in resolution by light diffraction or material diffusion. A central premise is that the manufacturing pathway must be accurate and reliable over time, with no intractable barriers to large-area adoption of the technology. Researchers will address issues that could limit the method's scalability including stamp cycling and durability, cleanliness, and alignment."

In this work, the investigators will leverage recent advances in quantum-inspired photonics to develop a high spatial resolution tactile sensing system with highly scalable sensor pixels that can monitor strain response at a microscale. Its integration with smart phones can create a compact and portable tactile sensor platform overcoming barriers in low spatial resolution, high cost, and high instrumental complexity of the state-of-the-art tactile sensors. This research is closely integrated with the existing educational activities, providing both undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge science and technology in an innovative way. The investigators also provide educational outreach activities to promote the interests and participations of K-12 students and broaden the participations from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The primary focus of this research project is to develop novel planar optical systems with optical exceptional points and arrange them on a flexible plastic platform in a chessboard configuration for high spatial resolution tactile sensing and imaging. The optical exceptional point structures, due to their planar nature, can support highly scalable fabrication using the widely used photolithography technique with spatial resolution down to even the microscale in a large area. Based upon a flexible plastic platform, this microscale tactile sensing imager can not only perform high-throughput real-time microscopic strain detection, but also enable simultaneous strain and temperature measurement with a microscopic resolution. The tactile sensor platform can be further integrated with portable electronic devices (e.g. hand-held smart phones), which would create a compact and portable tactile sensor imager platform for real-time detection in microbiology and healthcare, for example, the detection of mechanical properties of biomolecules. The principal investigators have highly complementary expertise in optics theory, advanced micro/nanofabrication technology, and device integration to design and fabricate the unique portable high spatial resolution tactile sensing platform based on novel optical exceptional point structures. The realized tactile sensing systems are expected to represent an important technological breakthrough in strain sensing, mapping and monitoring at a microscale with sensitivities orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art tactile sensors."

Select types of impurities, known as defect spins, exhibit desirable quantum features in room-temperature devices amenable to integration and miniaturization.  These defects respond to electric, magnetic, and optical fields, and they can be embedded in biocompatible nanoparticles to serve as quantum probes with nanometer precision.  The purpose of this CAREER project is to explore new ways to control defect spins in diamond, in order to realize practical technologies for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Specifically, this project aims to (i) demonstrate a new approach to probing diamond spins with light that dramatically boosts their functionality as quantum bits and quantum probes and (ii) isolate and manipulate coupled impurity spins that could serve as quantum memory bits with lifetimes measured in days at room temperature, improving over the state of the art by many orders of magnitude. These elements will form critical components for quantum computers, secure quantum communication links, and other chip-scale quantum technologies.  The project further incorporates broad educational goals to promote the emerging domain of quantum engineering, which breaks traditional boundaries between disciplines such as atomic and solid-state physics, electrical engineering, materials science, chemistry, and biology.

Furthermore, nanoscale sensing capabilities are limited by the standard optical readout mechanism for NV spins that requires averaging repeated measurements, which is woefully inefficient.  This project will address these challenges by leveraging the complex interplay of charge, orbital, optical, and spin dynamics in diamond impurities. A new technique to achieve all-optical, single-shot NV spin readout at room temperature will facilitate applications including quantum-limited sensing of local fields, probing quantum correlations between multiple spins, and sensing stochastic signals (e.g., neuron activity) that cannot be repetitively acquired. In parallel, investigations of spin and charge dynamics in coupled defect-donor spin systems aim to establish an optically-addressable quantum memory with room-temperature coherence times measured in days, which will enable secure communication technologies including quantum money and quantum repeaters."

The project will explore the materials science and physics of electrical contacts to solar cells. In so doing, it will advance the understanding of how these contacts limit the operation of the cells. Every solar cell must perform two processes: convert light into excited electrons and extract those electrons in the form of current. The former process is performed by a semiconductor absorber material; the latter by two electrical contacts between which the absorber is sandwiched. Although solar cells are mass manufactured and now generate 1% of the electricity consumed in the U.S., there are still fundamental questions that are unanswered. The research community does not yet understand which properties determine if a material will make an excellent electrical contact and how to quickly find and make materials with the desired properties. This project will provide answers to these questions with a combination of measurements and simulations applied to existing model systems, as well as experiments to use the resulting understanding to develop new contacts. Success in the project will lay the groundwork for solar cells that are 10-15% more efficient than today's cells, reducing the cost of solar electricity generation to below 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This, in turn, is predicted to accelerate the deployment of solar energy, resulting in 17% of U.S. electricity being generated by solar in 2030 instead of the 5% projected in a business-as-usual scenario. In addition to these scientific, environmental, and societal impacts, this project will also train community college, undergraduate, and graduate students for the 260,000 solar jobs presently in the US through a week-long, hands-on ""Solar Cell 101"" course in which they make cells and modules from start to finish.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>Many photovoltaic (PV) technologies have arrived at absorber materials that have low non-radiative recombination rates and thus could support cell voltages approaching the detailed-balance limit, but no technology has developed comparatively ideal electrical contacts that are transparent, that passivate the absorber surface, and that selectively extract electrons or holes from the absorber. This project targets key questions that inhibit rapid progress in heterojunction contact understanding and technology using (1) a characterization suite that links together the properties of carrier-selective layers, contacts containing those layers, and PV cells containing those contacts, and (2) a new deposition technique using dry-cluster spraying to enable intimate control of the stoichiometry of contact layers without sputter damage. These two platforms will be applied to crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride PV cells as model systems, as these technologies have readily available high-quality absorbers (which makes interpretation of the function of the contacts more apparent), a collection of previously developed contacts for these materials is available for analysis but ideal contacts have yet to be discovered, and any advances in understanding and technology resulting from the project will have large research and commercial impact. After studying the underlying physics of state-of-the-art existing contacts, the project will progress to depositing and testing heretofore unexplored carrier-selective layers, including wide-bandgap, heavily doped, amorphous or polycrystalline III-V materials. This research will address the critical impediment--excellent contacts--to 27%-efficient silicon PV cells and 25%-efficient cadmium telluride cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such devices are attractive sources of renewable power as they have reliable solid-state operation and can be scaled to large areas. However, low energy conversion efficiency and high cost in devices based on conventional materials have been technological bottlenecks to commercialization. Here, the PI will investigate an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution to these problems that is based on silicon nanowires. Two areas of innovation in thermoelectric devices will be targeted. First, silicon nanowires with engineered roughness will be used on the hot side of thermoelectric devices to convert heat to electricity in an efficient manner. The PI will measure individual nanowires and nanowire array structures at the high temperatures needed to recover waste heat. Second, metal-coated silicon nanowire arrays will be used on the cold side as a selective emitter to maximize radiative cooling. The nanowire-based radiative cooling surface will provide a substantial temperature gradient in the thermoelectric device without relying on active coolers or costly heat exchangers. The outcomes of this research will strengthen the areas of renewable energy production and waste heat recovery in the United States. The research will be integrated with educational activities through student mentoring and broad outreach efforts. The PI's integrated education plan will spark scientific interest of high school students and inspire undergraduate and graduate students to advance their interests at the intersection of materials science and device engineering.<br/><br/>Technical: The project seeks to answer how the nanowire surface boundary influences thermoelectric properties of individual nanowires over a wide range of temperature (10-700 K) by utilizing the PI's unique thermal metrology and controlling the roughness in silicon nanowires via metal-assisted chemical etching. While nanowire thermoelectric properties have been extensively studied, there remain gaps in our knowledge of fundamental determinants at the nanoscale and the properties at temperature ranges that are relevant to thermoelectric energy harvesting or where abundant low-and mid-grade heat sources are available. The project will investigate the effects of artificial periodicities in the roughness-controlled nanowires and identify thermal conductivity reduction mechanisms through theoretical, numerical, and experimental approaches. The project also seeks to answer how artificial periodicities lead to selective emission properties that are unachievable by natural materials and present a new pathway for radiative cooling by developing a nanowire-based selective emitter. Spectral emissivity computations based on rigorous coupled wave analysis will guide designs of nanowire arrays and keep the emissivity low in the near-infrared, which will minimize solar absorption, while keeping the emissivity high in the mid-infrared, which will maximize atmospheric cooling. Optical measurements based on reflectance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy will reveal the limits of artificial spectral control in nanowire systems and lead to a predictive model for radiative cooling in the ambient environment. The proposed investigations will establish new understanding of temperature-dependent transport phenomena with respect to roughness in individual nanowires and new understanding of spectral emissivity variations with respect to pitch and coating dimensions in nanowire arrays, which will ultimately elucidate how artificial periodicities interact with heat, electricity, and light. While synthesis and processing methods of silicon nanowires are well established, the project will explore their novel phononic and photonic properties as the thermoelectric material and as the surface cooling material to advance breakthroughs in thermoelectric devices.

However, existing optical tomography devices can only provide high-resolution imaging up to ~100 microns, limited by the single-scattering approximation.

For example, the read-head sensor in magnetic hard-disk drives is a spintronic device.  The next technology step for spintronics is to realize a spin-switch where the added benefit of non-volatility will be novel compared to charge-based technologies.

Existing generators of terahertz radiation have significant deficiencies that severely limit their usefulness. These generators either work at temperatures below room temperature or are based on expensive and bulky laser systems. The goal of this project is to create a new type of terahertz generator that is compact, inexpensive and works at room temperature. These generators are based on readily available magnetic materials such as iron oxide and nickel oxide and will operate via conversion of magnetic oscillations in these materials into terahertz electromagnetic waves. The goal of the proposed research program will be achieved via a collaborative effort of a synergistic team of experts in magnetic device fabrication (University of California, Irvine) and leading theorists in the field of magnetic devices (Oakland University).   The results of the proposed research program will impact society in multiple ways. The new method of terahertz signal generation will help maintain the US leadership in terahertz technology. A number of undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in modern device fabrication techniques, which will enhance the US nanotechnology workforce.

In such antiferromagnet-based auto-oscillators, an electric current in the Pt layer injects pure spin Hall current into the antiferromagnet and drives its order parameter into a state of persistent precession. This precession excited by the component of spin current perpendicular to the easy plane anisotropy of the antiferromagnet is non-uniform in time due to the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy present within the easy plane anisotropy. The frequency of the antiferromagnetic order parameter oscillations is proportional to the injected spin current, and increases from approximately 0.1 THz to 2.0 THz with increasing current density in the Pt layer. The order parameter oscillations are converted into a THz electromagnetic signal with electric field amplitude exceeding 1 V/cm via spin pumping and the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Pt layer. The dynamics of the THz-frequency room-temperature antiferromagnetic auto-oscillator is mathematically equivalent to that of a Josephson junction auto-oscillator, with the energy of the weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the antiferromagnet playing the role of the Josephson energy. The demonstration of these compact, tunable and structurally simple antiferromagnet-based sources of THz radiation will enable the development of compact and inexpensive solid state THz devices for imaging, chemical detection, wireless chip-to-chip communication and THz spectroscopy/microscopy."

The program will integrate outreach activities that span autistic students, K-12 students and other underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>Technical: The main focus of the proposed work is to develop an angle independent reflective metasurface with liquid crystals to achieve dynamic color tuning pixels. The implementation of dynamic pixels will reduce the need for multiple colored subpixels, thereby eliminating layered processing steps, increasing resolution, and allow unrivaled color control.  Furthermore, the device will independently tune color and grey-scale within a singular liquid crystal cell through novel liquid crystal optics design and multiple electrodes. Using nanoimprint lithography to produce the plasmonic structure over large areas, one can bypass expensive and tedious electron-beam or deep-UV lithography techniques used in fabricating many previously reported plasmonic devices. This in combination with ultrafast direct laser writing, multiple features at varying size scales can be incorporated into the master patterns. A single device master can include arbitrarily pixelated plasmonic metasurface, microscopic liquid crystal cell spacers, and nanoscale liquid crystal alignment gratings. One such master can produce 100's of polymeric imprinting stamps, and one such stamp can produce 1000's of imprints without any noticeable pattern degradation. Nanoimprint lithography has also been translated to roll-to-roll processing which shows the entire fabrication process can be scaled to factory norms. There is much to understand and develop in the field of actively tunable plasmonics. A fast response, angle independent liquid crystal-metasurface based display which can actively shift the color of its pixels is achievable based on this interdisciplinary research. An in depth analysis of the plasmonic metasurface, liquid crystal orientation and how they influence each other will be studied. A key objective of the proposed system is to design a wide angle metasurface based on a specially engineered metal-insulator-metal Fabry-Perot plasmon resonance which doesn't depend on structure periodicity. While apt at producing color, these plasmonic surfaces cannot produce deep black states needed for displays due to intrinsic narrow band absorption.  The proposed work intends to integrate plasmonic color tuning and liquid crystal grey state polarimetry within the same liquid crystal cell.  By introducing two sets of electrodes, color and brightness can be independently tuned through a novel device design.  The proposed device can readily be fabricated on flexible substrates as the low temperature fabrication process is compatible with low glassing temperature plastics. Special metasurface patterning allows device flexibility without damage to the underlying nanopatterns.  Such an approach can not only lead to large area skin-like full color display elements, but can also improve the active tunability of general plasmonic metamaterial systems."

Today, implantable neurostimulation (NS) devices have seen widespread adoption in the treatment of movement disorders, pain, and epilepsy, and have shown promise in treating psychiatric disorders, memory loss, depression, and more. Clinical neurostimulators have few channels and provide simple electrical pulses that are programmed by a doctor in a process that can take months or even years. There is a need for clinically viable, low-power and miniaturized systems that enable simultaneous stimulation and recording on many channels. Providing simultaneous sensing and closed-loop control will allow devices to automatically optimize parameters for a given outcome and only treat when symptoms are present, reducing side effects and reducing power. Closing the loop can provide dynamically delivered therapies that adjust electrical stimulation in response to a patient's real-time neural state. Furthermore, they will, for the first time, allow clinical researchers to understand the brain's response to stimulation and monitor changes (plasticity) over the long term. The future of medical care centers on wearable and implantable devices that will continuously monitor body functions and autonomously give treatment in an intelligent, closed-loop and well-controlled manner without the need for a doctor's intervention. This future requires broad, interdisciplinary engineering that combines electronics, artificial intelligence and biology. The multidisciplinary nature of this project extends to the long-term educational goals of promoting hands-on bioelectronic science and technology to the next generation of engineers. <br/> <br/><br/>This project develops miniaturized and highly integrated devices for closed-loop neuromodulation that combine high channel count neural recording with stimulation in a truly closed-loop manner for the first time. If successful, the proposed work will make significant advancements in two areas. First, low-power, low-noise integrated circuit design techniques will be developed to combine simultaneous stimulation and recording. Stimulation can significantly interfere with neural recording, resulting in large, persistent artifacts that mask or distort the neural signal and obscure reliable biomarker detection. Recording and stimulation circuits will be co-designed to eliminate this interaction. Second, online machine learning algorithms will be developed and integrated in hardware for dynamic closed-loop control. The emphasis will be to develop computationally efficient techniques that minimize the power consumption of the circuit. The two techniques will be combined into a single integrated circuit for multi-channel closed-loop neuromodulation that achieves a small footprint and ultra-low power dissipation that is safe for chronic use in humans. The device will be tested in animal models of disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semiconducting carbon nanotubes are among the best semiconductors that have ever been discovered. They promise to significantly improve the speed, energy efficiency, and sensitivity of a wide range of electronic devices including central processing units (the brains) of personal computers, servers, laptops, and tablets; circuits that send and receive signals for cell phones and communication devices; and sensors such as those employed when screening for diseases or new drugs. The tremendous promise of nanotubes was first discovered 25 years ago, but the field has been held back by materials, processing, and manufacturing roadblocks particularly pertaining to the organization and assembly of aligned arrays of nanotubes. A novel, multiphase fluid process recently discovered by this team called tangential flow interfacial self-assembly with promise for overcoming these roadblocks will be researched in this project. The project is motivated by compelling preliminary results, in which the team has assembled nanotubes into aligned arrays to create field effect transistors (the fundamental building block of electronics) with nearly 10 times higher on-state electrical conductance than previous nanotube transistors' that also exceed the on-state conductance of transistors fabricated from state-of-the-art semiconductors including silicon and gallium arsenide for the first time. In addition to graduate students, underrepresented researchers and undergraduate students from primarily undergraduate institutions will participate in the research effort. The supported graduate students will conduct science-related activities at a local Boys and Girls Clubs and develop new activities via collaboration with an outreach specialist. Local K-12 teachers will also be hosted for summer research experiences.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to assemble semiconducting nanotubes into aligned arrays that are organized across multiple length-scales and that can be integrated into devices and circuits, via a continuous scalable process. The ideal array microstructure consists of parallel semiconducting nanotubes that are densely packed but individualized at a pitch of 5-10 nanometers. This microstructure needs to be uniformly repeated on the wafer-scale. Our approach for scalably realizing this microstructure will be to hierarchically control the structure and organization of nanotubes via multiple stages of self-assembly. Specific research activities will focus on: (1) designing and tailoring the structure of polymer-nanotube conjugates to improve the Nano-, micro-, and millimeter-scale uniformity and reproducibility of ordered nanotubes arrays; (2) uncovering the fundamental factors that control the assembly of nanotubes during the recently discovered tangential flow interfacial self-assembly process; (3) scaling this process; and, (4) integrating assembled nanotube arrays into complex devices, circuits, and systems for next-generation radio frequency communications technologies. At the project's conclusion, the PI aims to provide: (i) a pilot-scale instrument for the continuous deposition of aligned nanotube arrays with exquisite control over microstructure; (ii) the first example of a uniform, densely aligned array of semiconducting nanotubes on the 200 mm wafer-scale - a scale relevant for commercialization; and, (iii) performance-superior radio frequency low-noise amplifiers and mixers fabricated from these arrays and wafers, of relevance for next-generation cellular, WiFi, and Internet of Things technologies."

It is usually detected with semiconductor detectors which exhibit a change in their electrical resistance under infrared illumination. The relative change in resistance at room temperature is, however, quite small, which necessitates cooling the detector with liquid nitrogen. In this research, a novel detector will be demonstrated, which relies on light changing the detector's resistance by affecting the quantum mechanical spin properties of the electrons that carry current. With this principle of detection, it is possible to make the resistance change in the detector much larger at room temperature. Room temperature infrared detectors are used in night vision, forensic science, astronomy, missile defense, car-collision avoidance systems and monitoring of global warming, to name a few.  Bit comparators are electronic devices that compare two digital (binary) bits of information and render a yes/no decision based on whether the two bits are the same or different. They are important ingredients of electronic circuits and are typically implemented with transistors which cannot remember the decision once the decision has been rendered. A comparator that exploits spin dependent properties and uses magnetic devices instead of transistors can remember the decision and also use less energy. The ability to remember makes it possible to build superior digital electronic circuits that are faster and more error-resilient. In this research, such a comparator will be demonstrated.  This project will also integrate research with graduate and undergraduate education, K-12 outreach through the Dean's Early Research Initiative program, and minority enrichment through the Richmond Minorities in Engineering Partnership.<br/><br/>This is a proposal to fabricate and demonstrate two novel spintronic devices - an infrared photodetector and a reconfigurable bit comparator - working at room temperature. They will be fabricated with 10- and 50-nm diameter nanowire spin valves with InSb spacer and cobalt contacts. In the InSb spacer, only a single electronic subband is occupied at room temperature. Preliminary experiments in the lab have shown that in these nanowires, the major spin relaxation mechanism of electrons - namely the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism - is eliminated owing to single subband occupancy, resulting in several-fold increase in the spin relaxation time. It has also been shown that the spin relaxation time can be modulated with infrared light, which will be exploited to build the photodetector.  Such a photodetector can, in principle, exhibit near-zero dark current, giant light-to-dark contrast ratio and very high detectivity which always elude conventional photo-detectors because of phonon excitations. Controlling the magnetization state of a nanomagnet with electrically generated strain has been recently demonstrated in our lab. That property will be leveraged to build the reconfigurable bit comparator with unprecedented energy efficiency. These bit comparators are ""non-volatile"" since they incorporate magnetic elements and hence the result of the comparison can be stored indefinitely in the comparator. The devices will be fabricated with electrochemical self-assembly of nanowires, electron-beam lithography for patterning ferromagnetic contacts, and dielectrophoresis for capturing a single nanowire between a pair of contacts to implement the photodetector and bit comparator."

A potentially superior solar technology is based on perovskites, which are crystalline minerals found in nature.  Perovskite solar cells have already achieved efficiencies close to that of silicon cells. However, current perovskite solar cells are not usable due to toxicity concerns (lead is generally used to fabricate perovskites) and short lifetimes. The goal of this research project is to synthesize an efficient, affordable, and environmentally safe germanium perovskite solar cell.  In addition to replacing lead by chemically similar but non-toxic germanium, inorganic layers, such as nickel oxide and tin oxide, will be explored as interfacial layers to improve stability. The devices will also be hermetically sealed with thin-film encapsulants, and characterized through accelerated testing to determine device lifetime. Lead perovskites have only lasted several months under ideal laboratory conditions. The proposed sealing techniques will enable module lifetimes to be greater than 20 years. The ability of these cells to be fabricated on a flexible substrate will further drive down the price of solar energy, helping solar energy to become less costly than fossil fuel derived energy. This project will provide multiple opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, K-12, and under-represented groups to engage in the next generation of renewable energy research.  A new course on future energy materials will benefit a broad range of students with interest in material science and thin film devices. The findings of this work will provide the research community with a greater understanding of the fundamental properties of this new perovskite material, and provide industry with the information needed for commercialization.<br/><br/>Technical description: In this work, germanium perovskite will be synthesized to build highly efficient, stable, and environmentally benign solar cells. The proposed germanium perovskites will overcome the deficiencies of lead-based perovskites including toxicity, interfacial layer instability, and limited lifetime. The project is two-fold: high quality germanium perovskite will be synthesized and characterized and then stabilized through thin-film encapsulants and inorganic interfacial layer selection. Germanium perovskites display excellent photovoltaic properties such as high optical absorption, high carrier mobility, and direct band gap. However, previous attempts were unsuccessful due to poor film morphology. A solvent-engineering approach will be used to achieve high-quality germanium-based perovskite. The perovskite's interfacial charge transport layers will be inorganic in nature to allow for greater device stability than can be achieved with organic layers. A solid-state reducing atmosphere will be used to prevent oxidative damage to the perovskite due to slow ingression of moisture and water over time. In addition, atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown metal-oxide barriers will cap the finished device, followed by a final epoxy sealing. The resulting hermetic seal will be characterized through helium and calcium leak tests, from which the expected module lifetime can be extrapolated. This sealing technique is anticipated to enable device lifetimes in excess of 20 years. The proposed work will provide a fundamental understanding of germanium perovskite synthesis, model the lifetime of encapsulated solar device, and play a critical role in achieving stable, low-cost, and environmentally safe solar cells."

Integration of metal-halide perovskites in tandem with commercially available solar cells, such as silicon, provides opportunities to significantly upgrade device and module performance. Further, the solution processability of metal-halide perovskites offers a cost effective option for upgrades to existing manufactured units. Through this collaboration, the most critical issues associated with AMX3 lead based perovskite-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells which prevent their achieving theoretically predicted efficiencies will be addressed.

However, there is an ongoing pressure to shrink the size of optical systems. Metasurfaces, which are ultrathin surfaces patterned with nanostructures, provide a new method to control the phase and amplitude of transmitted, reflected, and scattered light. Because of the virtually flat nature of metasurfaces (typical thickness < 100 nm), they can enable novel ultrathin optical components such as flat lenses, waveplates, and holography surfaces over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the optical properties for most metasurfaces are fixed upon their nanofabrication, restricting many real-world applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a tunable version of an ultrathin metasurface. The first goal of this project is to establish electronically-tunable conducting oxide metasurfaces that could be used for a variety of next-generation imaging and display technologies (e.g. tunable perfect absorber, color filter, beam steering device, etc.). The second goal of this project is to utilize our nanophotonic research and infrastructure to provide two-year technical college students, university undergraduate students, and graduate students with the nanophotonic skills and knowledge necessary for future academic and industrial careers. Furthermore, the project's events with area schools and a local science museum will provide exciting opportunities to introduce nanophotonic concepts to students and the general public in a fun and informative way. <br/><br/>Technical description: Optical metasurfaces are single- or few-layer structures with subwavelength thickness which produce abrupt changes in the phase, amplitude, or polarization of light. They show promise for extraordinary light manipulation and could enable novel ultrathin optical elements such as flat lenses, holograms, and optical vortex generation/detection devices. While metasurfaces hold considerable promise for future fundamental advances and novel optical applications, the lack of efficient optical tunability and low optical efficiency are key limiting issues for their use in a wide range of optical applications. <br/>The long range goal of this project is to develop an integrated program of research and education focused on developing efficient nanoscale metasurface components and their applications in meta-devices. The objective of this CAREER research is to establish an efficient and broadband electrical management of the absorptivity, optical phase, and spectral response of conducting oxide metasurfaces under an Epsilon-Near-Zero (ENZ) regime. To achieve this objective, the PI will identify approaches which yield efficient control of the carrier concentration of conducting oxide materials and the ENZ frequency with field-effect tunable metasurface resonance and gradient-index ENZ multilayer via atomic layer deposition. Establishing techniques to efficiently exploit the voltage-tuned ENZ resonance in metasurfaces to manipulate optical responses will enable development of tunable metasurface beam steering devices, color filters, and perfect absorbers, opening the path to revolutionary nano-optical imaging, display, and communication applications. Examples of novel devices that would utilize the technology include high-resolution beam steering devices for next generation visible LIDAR technology, perfect absorbers/spectrum splitting elements for photo/thermal-voltaic applications, tunable color filters/lenses for CMOS optical imaging and cutting-edge smartphone microscopies/spectroscopies, and ultrafast spatial light modulators with nanoscale pixels.

Current devices that perform this task require increasing amount of power. Many modern applications, such as mobile computing, on the other hand, does not have access to large power sources to remain functional. This has created a need to search for alternate means to process and transport information. Superfluidity, that is coherent flow of information in the absence of dissipation, provides an ideal solution to this problem. However, in materials explored so far, the superfluidity has been limited to cryogenic temperatures. Recently, taking advantage of the advancement of efficient electrical and thermal excitation of magnetic materials, phenomena inspired from superfluidity have been proposed to exist in room temperature magnetic materials. The goal of this project is to utilize such superfluid-inspired phenomena to propose and numerically evaluate energy-efficient superfluid-inspired magnetic devices. In particular, the prinicipal investigator will construct novel magnetic analogues of Josephson junctions, which are the building blocks of conventional cryogenic information processing and communication devices. Moreover, exploiting the fact that magnetic materials have inherently long memory and tunable properties, device functionality beyond those possible in conventional Josephson junctions will also be explored. During this project, the principal investigator will train undergraduate and graduate students, in modern materials modelling, for enhancing the United States? science, technology, engineering and math workforce.<br/><br/>The proposed research aims at unraveling novel superfluid-inspired magnetic devices by covering aspects-starting from the use of new magnetic materials to designing and benchmarking of application-driven device concepts. For this purpose, the following specific objectives will be pursued: (a) designing novel magnetic insulator-based Josephson junctions which are inspired from superconducting Josephson, (b) developing circuit theory for electrical and thermal bias driven superflow of spin through magnetic Josephson junctions (in close analogy to superconducting Josephson junctions) utilizing the phenomena of spin-orbit and thermomagnonic torques, and (c) using the circuit theory to assemble magnetic Josephson junctions for constructing new class of magnetic devices and benchmarking them for classical to quantum information processing, communication and energy harvesting applications. The last objective takes advantage of the well-developed device concepts based on superconducting Josephson Junctions, which can be mimicked within our proposed magnetic insulating systems. In addition, the proposed magnetic devices (being electrically reconfigurable and nonvolatile) add functionality beyond those existing in superconductor-based devices, such as amenability to beyond von-Neumann in-memory computing architectures. Exploring such device concepts will also form an integral part of the last objective. The proposed approach combines, for the first time, superfluid-based Josephson phenomena with above room temperature ordering of magnets. By tapping into superfluid-like properties of magnets, it opens up completely new avenues to solve the central technical challenge of achieving minimal energy wastage at high operating temperature for the next-generation information processing and communication devices. On a fundamental level, the theoretical program will serve as a unique playground to test and discover new phenomena at the interface of magnetism, superconductivity and caloritronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

XFELs accelerate a beam of electrons, focus the electron beam using quadrupoles, and convert the electron energy into coherent radiation using the magnetic field of an undulator. Coherent x-rays are used in phase contrast imaging, which offers 1000x better resolution compared to conventional x-ray imaging.  Currently, there is only one XFEL in the United States. As such, only a handful of scientists can access it, and potentially high-impact experiments languish as they wait in line for access.  Success of this project will lead to broadly accessible XFELs capable of atomic resolution imaging of non-crystalline samples and femtosecond imaging of dynamic processes. In this CAREER project, the PI plans to advance recent innovation in 3D micro-magnet fabrication that his group has pioneered to introduce a new generation of XFELs. To accomplish this overarching goal, the CAREER program will focus on achieving the following goals:  (1) Investigate micro-electromagnet quadrupoles that push the limits of focusing for the electron beams used in XFELs. (2) Explore tunable microscale undulators that leverage scaling laws of their sinusoidal magnetic field to create high energy photons from lower energy electron beams. (3) Introduce a lab-scale XFEL that is 1000x smaller than existing XFELs and > 1,000,000 times brighter than other coherent x-ray sources of its size.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>This research will investigate the fundamental limits of electron beam focusing and high-energy photon generation. Conventional quadrupole focusing magnets and undulators are centimeter-scale and individually machined, often by hand. Recent advances in fabrication of 3D electromagnets enable parallel fabrication of large arrays of microscale quadrupoles and undulators. Design optimization techniques will be used to explore novel designs of quadrupoles that focus an electron beam even as the quadrupole is scaled to the limit of the electron beam spot size.  Micro-undulators, smaller than any previously built, will access an operating regime where wakefield effects emerge, effects that have not been yet experimentally studied at this scale.  If successful, this research will create a new state of the art in high-strength quadrupoles and intense-field, short-period undulators, which will be used to create an XFEL with unmatched brightness among small-scale light sources.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>The proposed research lays the foundation for a new generation of coherent x-ray sources that would revolutionize access to high-speed coherent x-ray imaging for science and medicine. For scientists, intense, ultra-short x-ray pulses have the potential to expand high-speed imaging of biological structure and processes. Imaging of protein structure would become possible for the 40% of proteins that cannot be crystallized, and dynamic processes at the scale of atomic motion could be understood. Also, a 1000x reduction in x-ray dosage made possible by XFELs would diminish concerns about the health effects of medical x-rays, such as for the nearly 40 million mammograms performed in the US each year.  The PI plans to create an integrated research, education, and outreach program with the mission of recruiting and retaining underrepresented students in STEM. In collaboration with the CEED diversity center at UCLA, The PI will create a summer design challenge called ""Design It, Print It!"". In this 6-week design challenge, underrepresented (UR) K-12 students will design, 3D print, and test components to align quadrupoles and undulators. The K-12 students will be guided by an UR undergraduate engineering student, who will also participate in a paid research project during the school year. Four K-12 students and one undergraduate will participate per year, providing an in-depth research experience for twenty K-12 students and five undergraduates during the project. Each year, the PI and undergraduate will also visit the high schools of the K-12 participants to describe their work in 3D printing, reaching ~750 students over the life of the project."

Existing imaging technologies struggle to visualize the nanoscale ""wrinkles"" and roughness of these membranes due to their small sizes and fast fluctuations. This project will develop a synergistic approach called computational single-molecule nanoscopy that combines optical hardware, image processing software, and molecular sensors for imaging living cells with nanoscale resolution. The proposed technology will visualize the electrical and chemical environments within membranes that govern how they work. Ultimately, this approach will enable scientists to study how nanoscale structures within the membrane influence how molecules are transported across the membrane, which could be useful for the design of nanomedicines that target and kill cancer cells. The PI will collaborate with the Saint Louis Science Center and the Washington University SPECTRA student group to promote the public's scientific and technological understanding of this research. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research program will obtain broad knowledge and diverse technical skills in applied physics, optics, spectroscopy, estimation theory, image processing, and biology. These students will receive a unique and comprehensive preparation for modern careers in technology innovation and scientific discovery.<br/><br/>The proposed research will develop an integrated chemical, optical, and computational technology, termed computational single-molecule nanoscopy, for sensing and imaging the electrical and chemical properties of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution. The research approach is 1) to investigate the resolution and sensitivity limits of computational optical nanoscopy for measuring nanoscale information; 2) to quantify the performance of fluorescent molecules for sensing the electrical and chemical properties of their nano-environments; and 3) to visualize lipid rafts within cell membranes to determine how they regulate the trafficking of biomolecules across the membrane. The merit of the proposed work lies in innovatively exploiting the synergy between fluorescent molecules and optical microscopes. Rather than simply using fluorescent molecules as beacons that report a biomolecule's location, as current methods do now, the fluorescence emitted by rapidly-diffusing molecules will be used to measure the polarity and fluidity of a nano-environment. To harness the information reported by these molecules, new optical systems and image processing algorithms will be jointly designed to maximize the precision and sensitivity of nanoscale measurements in the presence of noise. Sensing the nanoscale properties of cell membranes will provide new insight into intercellular communication: how electrical, chemical, and mechanical signals propagate between cells and across their membranes."

However, lack of adequate and cost-effective instrumentation development in this spectral region has contributed to it being called the 'THz' gap, and has adversely affected the development of its application space. However, with new developments in nanotechnology, material science and optics, there has been a resurgence of active research interest in this frequency range and the research community are approaching the technology development from a broad range of scientific disciplines. The success of this project can enable robust, low-cost integrated, THz spectroscopic systems for the aforementioned applications. Such low-cost solutions for the THz frequency region will enable researchers and scientists engaged in this field to rapidly innovate on new technologies that can find extensive use in our daily lives.  The PI also expects that this research will engage and train both graduate and undergraduate students in multi-disciplinary fields, which are vitally important for solving challenging research problems for the future. The PI will also engage high-school seniors from local schools and broadly disseminate the knowledge through his proposed two courses and through publications, seminars and workshops.<br/><br/>THz-based spectroscopy is purported to have a wide range of applications in biomedical and chemical analysis. Current technology to perform THz spectroscopy in the time domain mostly relies on expensive optics including femtosecond lasers, photoconductive substrates, nonlinear optical elements and mechanical components making the system expensive, bulky and not amenable to integration. On the other hand, solid-state technology performs frequency domain spectroscopy using the classical down-conversion architecture. It requires a large bank of frequency synthesizers and multipliers covering the entire THz range making it unsuitable for integration. This proposal presents an electromagnetics-circuits-nonlinear estimation crosscut approach to enable chip-scale THz spectroscopy at room temperature through extraction of spectral information from electromagnetic scattering.  The key idea is that an electromagnetic interface between the on-chip receiver and the incoming THz wave itself creates an opportunity to perform spectral analysis of the incident signal, without requiring the traditional receiver following it.  This proposal seeks to establish the analytical framework for spectral estimation by measuring on-chip electromagnetic scattering.  It proposes techniques to estimate such scattering by measuring on-chip the magnitude of the induced surface current distribution on the planar antenna structure due to the incidence of the THz wave.  In addition, this proposal also seeks to exploit nonlinearity of the detectors to extract time-domain signature or phase information of the spectrum of the incident signal. This can potentially enable battery-powered, chip-scale THz spectroscopes for a wide range of sensing and imaging applications."

However, the disordered films used in today's organic electronic devices hold the U.S. back in science and industry. Studies on single crystals of conjugated organic molecules have been critical in driving our understanding and testing the limits of various properties of organic semiconductors, such as mobility, exciton diffusion length, etc. Despite the very promising implications of such studies, highly disordered amorphous films are currently used and studied for applications, because these disordered films can be reproducibly formed into pinhole free films. Crystalline heterojunctions promise combined high exciton diffusion lengths and carrier mobilities and, when used in vertical heterojunction devices, crystalline films can dramatically expand the application domain of organic electronics. This project will 1) enable important technological and industrial breakthroughs in organic electronic devices, and 2) strengthen technological leadership of the U.S. and prepare the next generation of STEM graduates, including women and underrepresented groups, to follow a STEM career. The PI will engage with the public and students, and is particularly involved in active learning activities to establish role models across generational gaps.<br/>In this project, the PI will study organic semiconductor films and heterojunctions with crystal domain sizes of up to 1 mm, very ordered when compared to amorphous or nanocrystalline films employed today. Notably, this will be accomplished while still maintaining a low surface roughness and pinhole free coverage. The fact that organic single crystals reveal highly attractive properties with respect to disordered films means that organic semiconductors hold significantly more promise than what can be realized with the disordered films of today. This is in terms of charge and exciton transport, central to the operation of organic electronic devices. Charge carrier mobility is up to two orders of magnitude more in crystals compared to disordered films (up to 20 vs. 0.1-1 cm2/Vs) along with evidence of band transport, whereas exciton diffusion lengths are up to 2 microns vs. 5-30 nm. These large differences between disordered films and single crystals are thought to source from grain boundaries and structural disorder. Two scientific goals that will allow for future applications are: 1) demonstrate high-performance crystalline heterojunction solar cells with greatly reduced energy losses; 2) unveil the role of grain boundaries on exciton and charge transport."

Although a high-precision timing signal can be obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, it is unavailable in many scenarios (e.g., underwater, underground, and certain indoor conditions). GPS timing is also susceptible to electromagnetic interference, especially at wartime. It is therefore of great importance to have innovative high-stability time-keeping devices local to the electronic systems. Since many of the electronic systems are mobile, their internal clocks should also be small and energy efficient. At present, the widely used clock devices, such as the crystal oscillators and the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) oscillators, can only achieve stability in the range of 0.01 ppm to 100 ppm, which is inadequate for many of the above applications. Achieving much better stability, the high-end oscillators used for precision timing would also consume much higher power of several watts. On the other hand, the atomic clocks, with their outputs locked to certain physical constants, offer excellent stability. This, however, comes at the expense of exceedingly large form factor and cost. This project proposed a novel terahertz (THz) molecular clock to address the above challenges. The proposed new solution will achieve stability in the range of parts per trillion, which will be several orders better than the current state-of-the-arts. The results will advance the THz science and engineering, and have significant potential impacts on billions of electronic systems. The research will be tightly integrated with the undergraduate and graduate education at MIT to cultivate the future engineering leaders with interdisciplinary training and vision.  <br/>    <br/>In this project, new approaches, which link an electronic output frequency with invariant physical constant but use a physical mechanism alternative to conventional atomic physics, will be investigated. The rotational-mode transitions of polar molecules under the probing of THz waves will be utilized as time bases. The generation, detection, and control of the THz waves will be implemented using standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit technology. The research, therefore, is expected to lead to high-stability clocks with very small size, very little power, and very low cost. Specifically, multi-resonance of molecules will be utilized to enhance the long-term stability of the molecular clock. New packaging technology will also be applied in order to miniaturize the clock size. At the system level, the clock will also operate in a low duty-cycled manner to obtain milliwatt-level power consumption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An interesting fact about solar cells is that the same physical principle that allows solar cells to absorb photons also allows them to emit photons when excited by light or electricity. This phenomenon is known as luminescence. For most solar cells, this bidirectional process is not symmetric. That is, photon absorption is more efficient than photon emission. This is the case for silicon solar cells. There are other materials, however, such as Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) that are efficient at both absorbing and emitting photons. In this project the light emitted by GaAs solar cells will be modulated to transmit information wirelessly. Devices that use this approach will be able to use their solar cells as optical antennas that transmit and receive information optically while capturing energy from their environment to power themselves. The proposed technology will provide a new means of communication for devices connected to the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The IoT extends the Internet to everyday objects in a seamless manner with the goal of enhancing our lives. For instance, the proposed devices can be used in smart labels to monitor the temperature of perishable goods as they move through the supply chain. They can also be used in smart homes and smart factories to connect appliances and tools to the IoT. Other applications include environmental and agricultural monitoring. This project will advance the field of electronics and communications by providing a new class of wireless devices. This project will also enhance the education of American college and pre-college students by involving them in research activities to stimulate their interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to take advantage of the luminescence emissions of GaAs solar cells to create a new type of wireless device that transmits information optically. Previously, photo-luminescence and electro-luminescence emissions were employed to characterize defects and materials parameters of solar cells. Here, luminescence emissions are exploited for wireless communications by modulating their intensities. Hence, this project has the potential to start a new area of research in optical communications in which light is used to convey energy and information to and from passive devices. Given that these devices will employ a new approach to the transmission of information, the project will address several fundamental questions and technical challenges to make the proposed concept viable. In particular, this project will address the following questions: 1) how fast and how far can information be transmitted using modulated luminescence emissions from high-efficiency solar cells 2) what is the best scheme for luminescence modulation 3) what circuit architectures and implementations will yield the lowest power consumption These questions will be studied and answered through the following research tasks: 1) characterizing solar cells as transmitters and receivers of information; 2) selecting suitable modulation schemes; 3) developing configurable hardware platform to validate selected luminescence modulation schemes; 4) developing a low-power platform to demonstrate self-powered operation of the proposed devices; 5) testing the hardware platforms. The proposed research will result in a new wireless technology for IoT applications. Advantages of this technology over radio-frequency wireless devices include reduced electromagnetic interference and avoidance of heavily-used and congested radio frequency spectrum. Other advantages include the ability of precise transmitter localization using camera-based receivers and the possibility to work underwater. As such, the proposed technology has the potential for creating new commercial applications and business opportunities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compound eyes typically consist of a curved array of many imaging elements (including lenses and photoreceptors), each oriented so as to detect light incident along a different direction. The full image of the object being visualized is then reconstructed from the combined inputs of all such elements. The optoelectronic implementation of this vision modality is generally complicated by its curved architecture, since standard optoelectronic devices are based on planar substrates. The compound-eye vision modality represents the optimally adapted solution to provide wide-angle field of view with negligible distortion within the smallest possible package. Furthermore, compound eyes can create focused images of objects at arbitrary distances without the need for any focal-length adjustment, and thus offer nearly infinite depth of field and extremely high acuity to motion. The proposed cameras could therefore provide an enabling technology for a wide range of imaging applications where small size, large field of view, and high temporal resolution are of particular importance. Specific examples include machine vision (e.g., for obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation), surveillance, and endoscopic medical imaging. The proposed activities will also promote education through the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of topics within nanophotonics, optoelectronics, and image processing. Related curriculum development efforts will impact students in other disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The proposed research will leverage recent advances in nanophotonics and metamaterials to develop a planar lens-free compound-eye camera consisting of a planar array of imaging pixels. The angle selectivity of each pixel is provided by specially designed arrays of metallic nanoparticles (optical metasurfaces) patterned on the surface of each photodetector. The key innovation of the proposed research is the development of metasurfaces that can selectively transmit into their substrate only light incident along a single geometrically tunable direction (within a small range). Light incident along any other direction will be reflected. With this arrangement, lens-free compound-eye cameras can be implemented using existing CMOS or CCD image-sensor arrays. Each pixel will be coated with a different metasurface designed to allow for the detection of light from a different direction. The proposed angle-sensitive photodetectors will be designed via full-wave numerical simulations, fabricated on silicon substrates, and characterized through angle-resolved photocurrent measurements. Arrays of these devices will then be developed for a proof-of-concept demonstration of their imaging capabilities. Advanced computational imaging algorithms will be employed to optimize the image reconstruction from the combined signals of the individual sensors. In addition to the potential technological impact of the proposed cameras, this research will also advance the science and technology of optical metasurfaces through the exploration of novel designs and applications, and will create new research opportunities in the emerging field of computational imaging."

Specifically, the project has the following four objectives: (1) gain a fundamental understanding of battery degradation mechanisms and how they couple, and integrate that knowledge into a high-fidelity battery model; (2) create a low-order battery model that can generate the predicted results quickly without losing accuracy; (3) understand uncertainty phenomena in microgrids, and create a model to incorporate all of the phenomena; and (4) develop algorithms for optimal scheduling by considering battery degradation and microgrid uncertainty. The proposed research will discover how the uncertain nature of a microgrid can affect individual components, including energy storage degradation; the results are expected to constitute critical knowledge for the power engineering community. In addition, this project will develop a stochastic optimization technique for near-real-time optimal scheduling. It is expected that the general framework developed here will be adaptable for applications beyond power engineering."

Unlike existing cellular networks, IoT applications are expected to connect a massive number of smart IoT devices under severe bandwidth constraint. This massive scale and need of IoT wireless devices, along with many other rising wireless applications such as vehicular to everything (V2X) strongly motivates highly effective utilization of network capacity.  To substantially expand network capacity, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a cutting-edge technology that integrates the concepts of superposition coding at transmitter and successive interference cancelation (SIC) at receiver,  respectively.  NOMA has attracted much attention for its high spectral efficiency.  However, the NOMA throughput gain comes at the price of having to overcome substantial co-channel interferences (CCI) among wireless network nodes. Despite the widespread and idealized receiver assumption of perfect interference cancellation, practical success of NOMA receivers depends critically on the successful detection and decoding of signals in the presence of substantial CCI. This research project aims to develop highly effective and practical joint detection and decoding receivers to deliver the much needed network performance for successful deployment of NOMA in future 5G and IoT wireless services.  Specifically, the project develops optimized design of joint detection and error correction receivers by leveraging the knowledge of user forward error correction codes to substantially improve receiver performance against CCI under channel uncertainties. The research findings can contribute importantly to the service improvement of high speed wireless networks and to broadening their applications in many practical fields where quality, efficiency, and service decentralization are paramount. The success of the project can lead to new system designs, new tools, and results that can impact other science and engineering fields. <br/><br/>The technical focus of this project is to develop a new receiver design methodology that unifies signal detection and forward error correction in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications and diversity networks against poor wireless channel conditions. Unlike traditional approaches, this new investigation into the rather classic but open problem centers on novel optimization formulations that can incorporate Galois field codeword constraints imposed by the forward error correction (FEC) codes within the maximum likelihood detection principle for unified receiver optimization. This novel framework is general and encompasses many wireless models, including distributed MIMO, opportunistic cooperative networking, and retransmission diversities as well as their integrations.  This innovative direction emphasizes critical integration of multiple constraints from incompatible fields through effective constraint relaxation and novel objective function formulation.  Reformulating the optimization of joint detection and decoding problems into convex optimization, the proposed approach to receiver design integration represents a fundamental and practical design paradigm that can fully leverage various practical signaling and code constraints for joint detection and decoding against channel and other non-idealities to achieve high performance, efficiency, and reliability.  To confront practical challenges of channel estimation errors and fast channel fading in wireless networks, the project team shall develop fast, effective, reliable, and robust algorithms for coded MIMO transmissions under strong co-channel interferences subject to different practical limitations and network configurations, with respect to complexity and performance tradeoffs. The research findings are expected to have significant broader impact on a wide range of wireless applications including high speed cellular, IoT, and V2X services."

This waste of energy occurs as many of the current systems such as refrigerators, automobiles, and industrial process are fundamentally very inefficient and power is wasted as heat. Some of this waste heat could be utilized with low-cost recovery technologies.  However, current waste heat conversion devices are very inefficient and are relatively expensive. Hence, research needs to be carried out to find low cost and more efficient solutions for waste heat recovery. The proposed research will investigate a new thermoelectric (thermal-to-electric energy conversion) process for developing efficient waste heat recovery at low cost. The research will also train future scientists and engineers in the energy sector. The principal investigator and co-principal investigator will involve teachers and students in the project and will display materials at the local Science Museum and library as part of outreach and educational activities. The growth of alternative energy technologies will have an important impact on society to meet its energy needs and will lower the nation's dependence on foreign oil thus improving the nation's energy security.<br/><br/>Significant progress has been made in thermoelectric power conversion devices with efficiencies reaching over 10%. To realize the commercial potential of thermoelectric devices, further improvements in efficiency, long-term stability at high temperatures and lower cost of fabrication must be realized. A world-wide research effort is being carried out to realize the above goals. Correspondingly, this proposal consists of a multidisciplinary team of a faculty member from the University of Minnesota (Prof. Kortshagen) with research expertise in novel gas phase synthesis of nanoparticles and a faculty member from the University of Virginia (Prof. Gupta) with research expertise in laser processing and device physics.  The research plan is to provide understanding of nanograined thermoelectric materials and to achieve further enhancement in efficiency, long-term stability and reduced fabrication costs.  The hypothesis of the research is that nanograined materials can enhance the overall thermoelectric device efficiency by reduction of thermal conductivity due to enormous interfacial area causing enhanced phonon scattering and an increase of Seebeck coefficient due to filtering of electron energy producing a higher voltage. Another hypothesis is that nearly fully-dense films and bulk materials can be realized by pulsed laser sintering of nanoparticles to avoid major grain growth by nanosecond heating and cooling rates. The realization of the goals will be achieved through the following tasks: (1) vapor phase synthesis of SiGe nanoparticles of < 20 nm in size, (2) p- and n- type doping of SiGe nanoparticles during vapor phase synthesis, (3) nanosecond pulsed laser sintering of vapor phase synthesized nanoparticles of SiGe to achieve close to theoretical density, (4) fabrication of thermoelectric devices and evaluation of high-temperature  performance up to 1000 C, and (5) enhancement of research through collaboration with DOE funded thermoelectric materials and device laboratory at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for fundamental understanding of material and device properties at very high temperatures using state of the art high-temperature  characterization facility for crystal structures, electrical and thermal properties."

In a wide range of applications, networked dynamical systems theory provides a coherent framework to model phenomena such as the emergence of highly structured or synchronized global behavior, or to analyze the possibility of altering the natural dynamics in a collection of decentralized interacting dynamic systems.  In both natural and man-made systems, the presence of inherent network structures may explain the onset of collective behavior or inhibit the possibility of freely controlling the dynamics of the system.  Although such structures are mathematically rare, they appear widely in real-world networks such as yeast protein interactions and human B cell genetic networks, technological networks such as the Western States US power grid, US airports, the Internet, and social networks such as email and academic collaboration networks.  From a controls design perspective, it is therefore imperative to fully understand for a networked dynamic system how the local structure of the network affects the ability to control or alter its dynamic behavior and to develop algorithms that avoid undesirable control intervention.  The proposed research will provide STEM training for students at a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a predominantly minority population.  Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will involve students from several STEM disciplines such as electrical engineering, applied mathematics, and computer science. <br/><br/>The existing body of knowledge on the relationship between network structure and the ability to control the dynamics of a multi-agent system has fallen behind in addressing the need to control ever more complex networks in engineering and naturally occurring systems.

The methods used in the proposed research will blend techniques from mathematical control theory, algebraic graph theory and matrix analysis, and scientific computing. Outcomes of the research will include a catalog of new network structures directly related with the ability to control a given networked dynamic system, and efficient algorithms to detect these structures and their demonstration in real-world technological and biological networks.  The expected results will add to the development of a usable theory of the control of networked multi-agent systems.

Tumor-targeting surface enhanced Raman scattering nanoparticles based multiplexed Raman spectroscopy has recently demonstrated great potentials to promote early and accurate cancer detection, which significantly impact patient's survival rates. Spectral fingerprints of Raman nanoparticles make it possible to study multiple cell surface biomarkers and analyze targeted drug delivery in breast cancer rat models. With long scanning time in slow speed, conventional Raman spectroscopy can only image ex-vivo tissue specimens or monitor small animals under anesthesia, which behave differently from free moving ones. There is an unmet need for an implantable Raman system, which performs in-vivo multiplexed wide-field imaging and longitudinal study on tumor, monitoring the dynamic response after drug delivery, and quantitatively study targeted nanoparticles for multiple biomarkers. This project will be focused on implantable thermal micro-scanner based Raman spectroscope for wide-field tumor-imaging in free moving breast cancer rat model. Societal impact will be significant, not only on scientific communities (cancer biology), but also on broader communities of energy science (solar cell inspection), pharmaceutical industry (drug screening). The scientific impact is to generate knowledge that will be significance to researchers in the field of implantable micro-system. The outcomes will yield next generation transformative devices to enable a comprehensive understanding of tumor development and targeted drug delivery. This project will provide educational opportunities for students to learn different disciplines and develop multiple skill sets. Outreach events will transform state-of-the-art technologies to educational resources that are more accessible to local K-12 schools and broader communities in greater Lansing area. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to overcome the fundamental limitations in miniaturized ultra-low power surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy aimed for in-vivo wide-field tumor imaging in free moving rat. The research plan will be focused on developing an implantable microelectromechanical system based Raman spectroscopy for in-vivo monitoring and longitudinal study of tumor growth and nanoparticles based targeted drug delivery. To achieve this goal, an ultra-low power vanadium dioxide based self-sensing thermal monolithic micro-scanner will be developed for fast beam steering with large mirror deflection in two-dimensional raster scan manner, which enables wide-field spectroscopic imaging with large field-of-view. Novel micro-scale electroplating and molding techniques based mass-producible integration process will be developed for ultra-thin opto-mechanical devices, including the implantable Raman scan-head. In addition, an ultra-compact ultra-low power micro-scanner based Raman spectrometer will be developed based on single element near infra-red photomultiplier tube and a vanadium dioxide micro-scanner with on-chip grating. For interconnecting the scan-head with spectrometer and providing physiological recording, a compact small animal backpack with integrated physiology sensors on conformal surface, will be developed using stereolithography three-dimensional printing process. Finally, the platform will be characterized on free moving breast cancer rat model for acquiring Raman spectra from nanoparticles conjugated with anti-bodies specifically targeting over-expressed biomarkers. Although significant progress has been made in the Raman spectroscopy on biological tissue samples, molecularly targeted wide-field in-vivo multiplexed Raman imaging of tumor in free moving rat has not been demonstrated yet. Miniaturization of the scan-head and spectrometer with ultra-low power consumption is critical to implantable Raman system. The proposed implantable ultra-low power thermal micro-scanner enabled Raman imaging strategy will overcome the fundamental limitation in current Raman imaging modality that has urgent and unmet needs, such as higher sensitivity, scalable resolution, deeper penetration, shorter integration time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aerospace vehicles, autonomous robots, power generators and grids, chemical processes, bioengineering systems, and economic processes are sample applications in which ADP has provided numerous benefits for society through its superior performance compared with alternative methods. However, the utilization of the scheme for sensitive systems requires ironclad guarantees of suitable performance, the lack of which is typically a shortcoming of ADP.

Besides the research objectives, the PI will pursue educational objectives including promoting undergraduate research and involving underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The project addresses optimal control problems with discrete-time dynamics, continuous state spaces, continuous or discrete action spaces, undiscounted finite horizon or infinite horizon cost functions, and possibly unknown dynamics.  Analysis of convergence of the learning iterations, stability of the results, and continuity of the functions subject to approximation (which guarantees the possibility of their uniform approximation), comprise the initial stage the project. Analyzing the ramifications of the presence of approximation errors on the optimality and stability of the resulting controllers is another task of the project along with investigating the implications of ceasing learning after a finite number of iterations. Moreover, firm estimates of the domain of attraction for several variations of ADP will be sought in order to guarantee that the states of the system starting in the domain in which the solution is learned will never exit it; hence, ensuring the solution will remain valid and reliable. The main idea of the project is utilizing the uniform approximation capability of parametric function approximators to investigate their consequences on the learning iterations and the reliability of the result.

In this project, researchers from the United States, Republic of Ireland (ROI), and Northern Ireland (NI) propose to study fundamental properties, such as phase and spin coherences, inter-valley scattering, and magnetism in intrinsic and magnetically doped 2D TMDs.  Each PI will be supported by their respective funding agencies through the US Ireland R & D Partnership Program.  The Research Team is interdisciplinary with complementary expertise.  The NI group will carry out multi-scale modeling using state-of-the-art theoretical methods to predict new properties as well as provide fundamental understanding of the experimental work.  The ROI group will provide multi-scale characterization and develop new scanning transmission electron microscopy methods to simultaneously obtain information about atomic and magnetic structures.  The US group will investigate new synthesis methods to obtain magnetic 2D materials and perform quantum transport measurements to elucidate fundamental spin and inter-valley scattering mechanisms.  The collaborative research will lead to realization of synergies through formation of an interdisciplinary team who will work on spin and valley physics in 2D materials to enable exciting scientific discoveries.  The educational and training activities of the proposed project will complement the scientific impact of the proposed project.  The graduate students from the US, Ireland, and Northern Ireland will benefit from the scientific and educational components of the program.  This collaboration will result in developing highly engaged, globally networked graduate students with interdisciplinary knowledge experienced in international and national laboratory environments.  The students will benefit from international exchanges by developing new skills beyond the expertise of their core doctoral thesis topics.  Additionally, focused outreach activities will involve engaging high school students as well as middle and high school teachers to be familiarized with materials science as well as engaging public by organizing laboratory tours, designing hands-on demonstrations, and issuing timely press releases.<br/><br/>The main goal of this proposal is to provide new insights in: (i) fundamental interactions of spin and valley with magnetic impurities in the very dilute (i.e. intrinsic) or weak magnetic ordering regime; and (ii) ferromagnetism in 2D semiconductors in the high magnetic ordering regime and its influence on spin polarization and coherence.  The new knowledge obtained from this project will be complementary in realizing future spintronics and valleytronics devices based on 2D TMDs.  In addition, electrical doping remains an unresolved question in 2D semiconductors and it is expected the outcome of this research will address key fundamental questions regarding thermodynamic concentration limit and influence of impurities on electronic and magnetic properties.  These properties will be investigated by quantum transport and Hall Effect measurements to obtain information about weak localization for the non-magnetic materials.  Information about spin-polarized transport in magnetic samples will be obtained using magneto-resistance measurements with in-plane magnetic fields.  It is expected that the research will generate the foundation of new fundamental knowledge and investigate the feasibility of experimentally realizing 2D magnetic TMDs for fabrication of spintronic and valleytronic devices.  This US-Ireland partnership will provide a framework to collaborate theoretically and experimentally for realizing new 2D materials properties and thier potential synergies for device applications."

However, this type of interactions remains difficult to quantify, mainly because of the lack of a suitable technique to provide a reliable and characteristic parameter. This proposal will develop a novel force spectroscopy that uses precisely controlled ultrasound to measure the binding forces to distinguish different molecular bonds. Tens of thousands of molecular bonds will be studied simultaneously and resolved based on their different binding forces. The technique, termed as ultrasound force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (usFIRMS), will be a new scientific tool for studying molecular interactions, with high sensitivity, unprecedented resolution, and high detection efficiency. By overcoming the engineering challenges involved in the integration of ultrasound and the magnetic detector, the resulting instrument will be able to identify different molecular interactions precisely, reliably, and efficiently. The application scope of the new technique will focus on drug molecules binding with DNA duplexes to precisely reveal their binding forces and thermodynamics. The results will quantitatively identify the binding selectivity. Lack of selectivity has been a major setback for DNA-targeting drugs. Results obtained by the new technique are thus of high scientific merit. In addition to the engineering advancements and scientific values, the research activities in this proposal will provide excellent educational opportunities for students from a broad background, ranging from graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. In particular, minority undergraduate students will be actively recruited for participation and ultimately leading a subset of the projects. <br/><br/>This proposal aims at establishing the novel usFIRMS technique that uses acoustic radiation force generated by precisely attenuated ultrasound to selectively dissociate noncovalent bonds labeled with magnetically particles. The magnetic signal is monitored by an atomic magnetometer, which is the most sensitive device for magnetic detection. The proposed usFIRMS technique will open up a new field for characterizing noncovalent bonding, which is poorly understood but widely encountered in biochemistry and biology. On the technological front, this technique has three unique capabilities comparing with existing techniques. First, it possesses high force resolution that can clearly resolve molecular bonds with less than two pico-newton difference in the binding forces, which is one order of magnitude better than that of existing techniques. Second, it represents the first time that ultrasound is used for distinguishing molecular bonds. By integrating ultrasound components with an atomic magnetometer, the instrument allows for efficient and automated biochemical analysis that cannot be obtained with any other forms of mechanical forces. Third, the concept of broadband force spectroscopy will resolve different bonds in a single acquisition, instead of the time-consuming force sweeping. This revolutionary advancement will lead to high-throughput applications. On the fundamental science front, the application of usFIRMS in drug-DNA interactions will quantitatively identify the binding selectivity by establishing a new physicochemical parameter of differential binding force. It will serve as a new platform for drug optimization. The binding constants, free energy, and enthalpy can also be precisely determined because different molecular bonds are completely resolved to remove potential interference in measurements. Furthermore, the usFIRMS technique will find broad applications in biological research because of its unique combination of high resolution, high efficiency, and high applicability."

Advances in algorithms for convex optimization over the last twenty-five years have resulted in reliable and user-friendly software tools that are widely used in academic research and industry. The most popular software packages are based on a separation between a modeling front-end and a general-purpose solver for semidefinite optimization (a matrix extension of classical linear programming, and a special case of conic linear optimization). The task of the modeling front-end is to translate the optimization problem into the canonical form required by the semidefinite optimization solver. The techniques used in this translation step are the outcome of extensive research on how to represent nonlinear convex constraints in the semidefinite optimization format. The algorithms used in the solvers are primal-dual interior-point methods for semidefinite optimization, which reached a high level of maturity in the early 2000s. Each of these two layers brings a limit on scalability. The reduction to semidefinite optimization in the modeling step often requires the introduction of auxiliary variables and constraints, which can increase the size of the optimization problem considerably. In addition, the semidefinite optimization algorithms that are commonly used in convex optimization solvers are second-order methods and require in each iteration the solution of large, often dense, sets of linear equations.  This further limits the size of the problems that can be solved. This proposal is motivated by the increasing demand for large-scale convex optimization algorithms in control, signal processing, and system identification. The project focuses on developing specialized methods for two types of constraints that underlie some of the most important convex optimization applications in these areas, and that have recently found new applications in statistical signal processing and machine learning.    <br/><br/>The first class of problems consists of convex optimization problems involving convex cones of nonnegative Popov functions. This includes nonnegative matrix polynomials and trigonometric polynomials, and is of fundamental importance in linear system theory, control, and signal processing. The second class includes system identification methods based on minimizing the nuclear norm (trace norm) of structured matrices. The focus on these two problem classes is motivated by several reasons: first, their central position in system theory and signal processing; second, well-known difficulties in solving them using general-purpose semidefinite optimization software;  and, third, their importance in recently discovered techniques that extend 1-norm optimization methods for sparse signal recovery to sparse signal recovery problems over continuous domains and to matrix rank minimization problems. Two algorithmic approaches will be considered for each of the two problem classes: interior-point methods for non-symmetric conic optimization, that handle the constraints directly without embedding them in a much larger semidefinite optimization problem, and first-order proximal algorithms based on operator splitting and decomposition techniques."

To date, there are no efficient semiconductor lasers operating in the deep visible (green and yellow) spectral range, which has been limited by the presence of large densities of defects in gallium nitride based materials. Consequently, the current commercial green lasers generally rely on the use of nonlinear optical conversion. Such devices, however, are bulky, heavy and expensive, and are not suitable for on-chip integration. Moreover, there has been no established manufacturable technology to spatially vary alloy compositions to achieve multi-color emission on the same substrate. As a result, the current solid-state lamps rely on the use of rare earth doped phosphors to down-convert the blue emission of a gallium nitride based light emitting diode (LED) to generate white-light, which limits the flexibility to tune the spectral power distribution and to achieve color-tunable emission. In this project, by using gallium nitride based nanostructures, the applicant will address these fundamental challenges and demonstrate small size, high efficiency multi-color lasers. This project will address the ""green gap"" in semiconductor light emitters and will enable phosphor-free solid-state lighting, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency, reducing the manufacturing cost, and improving the light quality. The broader impacts of this research also include the highly interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and the outreach to undergraduate, underrepresented minorities, and K-12. This project also provides the opportunity to educate the students involved in the research and to involve high school students on the science and technology of nanostructured materials, LED lighting, and photonics.<br/><br/>Technical: The applicant proposes to demonstrate white-color and full-color surface-emitting lasers through innovations in epitaxy, quantum-confined nanostructures, nanophotonics, and device engineering. Full-color emission will be achieved on a single chip by varying the nanowire diameters through selective area epitaxy, which was not previously possible for gallium nitride based quantum wells. Moreover, nonradiative surface recombination, one of the primary limiting factors for nanowire devices, will be addressed by using dot-in-nanowire core-shell heterostructures. In this project, surface-emitting lasers will be achieved by exploiting the two-dimensional band-edge resonant effect of a nanowire photonic crystal, instead of using conventional thick and resistive distributed Bragg reflectors. The unique approach will also enable the monolithic integration of red, green and blue emitters on a single chip, thereby leading to full-color and white-color laser diodes that were not previously possible. The device characteristics, including threshold, wall-plug efficiency, near and far-field profile, and modulation characteristics will be investigated."

There have been significant efforts to realize neural network architectures using electronic integrated circuit technology.  However, electronic-only hardware is not suitable for high bandwidth applications critical to a modern information world. In contrast, the internet is powered by photonic technologies (lasers, electro-optic modulator and photodetectors) because of light's high bandwidth, speed and low energy consumption. Consequently, this project aims to realize high performance neural networks that utilize light. These photonic neural networks will be integrated on a photonic chip in order to realize scalable and efficient architectures.  However, in order to build neural networks that transcend today's state-of-art, it is necessary to also leverage electronics due to the challenges surrounding photonic memory and amplification, both of which are key to realizing a general purpose neural network. This hybrid approach, where electronics and photonics would be integrated together,  enables the investigation of the broadest class of problems.  In addition to these research aims, this project is an interdisciplinary activity that will provide technical training for future science and engineering professionals.  There will be outreach activities that bring the research to  K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Students from underrepresented backgrounds will be actively engaged by providing lab visits with hands-on activities.  Lastly, the education initiatives of AIM Photonics Academy will be leveraged to disseminate the research in the project. Overall this project will impact the broader community with applications in autonomous systems, vision systems, information networks, cybersecurity, robotics and other high bandwidth applications.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to address two fundamental questions, i) How can photonics maximize functionality in the compute domains?, ii) What neuromorphic algorithms can solve a broad class of problems using photonics?<br/>The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate hybrid silicon electronic-photonic integrated neuromorphic networks. The proposed paradigm leverages the power of optical interference to realize high performance neuromorphic computing networks. Photonic implementations of neural networks offer the inherent advantage that light can easily perform computational tasks that are traditionally challenging to do in electronic-only implementations  (e.g. a Fourier transform can be done optically by simply passing light through a lens). The underlying integrated photonic-electronic network proposed here utilizes a Multimode interference coupler as a neural core (Neuro-MMI) in order to realize interference between multiple inputs and outputs in a compact footprint. The principal investigators propose to realize reconfigurability of the weights in the neural network wrapped around the MMI core. The Neuro-MMI core will be integrated with optoelectronic nonlinear thresholding circuits (along with electronic memory) to realize different classes of neural networks (feed forward neural networks and recurrent neural networks).  Active Neuro-MMI's will be studied to realize on-chip learning and new learning rules will be investigated that are inherent for these topologies. Furthermore, the use of wavelength division multiplexing will be explored  to achieve  dense connectivity and parallelism in order to maximize the performance of the networks. One unique feature of the proposed hybrid photonic-electronic network is the reconfigurability to switch between feed forward and recurrent neural networks on a single chip.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specialized optical imaging devices can also capture additional information such as the polarization of the light or even a three-dimensional (3D) image of objects in a scene. This extra information is helpful in a wide range of applications, such as in sensors for self-driving cars, for identifying different types of cells and tissues in biomedical imaging, or for keeping a richer historical record than is offered by a simple 2D image. While devices already exist that can record 3D and polarization information, they are typically much larger and bulkier than a standard cell phone camera. In this proposal, approaches to significantly reduce the size and weight of such devices will be studied. This involves not only new optical designs, but also new approaches to the processes of designing and constructing 3D optical devices out of building blocks that are much smaller than the wavelength of light. In addition to enabling particularly small devices, such small building blocks interact with light based on different physical principles than those that apply to large optics. The research will be incorporated into a course at the University of Arizona, and undergraduate students and high school teachers will also partake in the research. Native American students and their educators, who are often disadvantaged in terms of their exposure to science and engineering, will be a major demographic target.<br/>Technical: The goal of this proposal is to use three-dimensional (3D) nanophotonics to enable imaging devices with angle, wavelength, and polarization sensitivity in significantly more compact and lighter weight systems than is currently possible. In existing angle-sensitive 3D light-field imaging approaches, the diffraction limit imposes a minimum useful pixel size. Although not previously demonstrated, nanophotonics offers the potential to significantly reduce the minimum pixel size, which can in turn allow for reductions in the size of any external optics. Novel high-speed optimization-based algorithms will be used to design 3D nanophotonic structures composed of metallic and/or dielectric nanoparticle building blocks. On individual pixels, different structures will selectively receive incoming light with specific incidence angles, polarizations, and/or wavelengths. Photonic nanostructures that cover entire blocks of pixels will also be designed to sort incoming light based on incidence angle, wavelength, and polarization. The nanostructures will be fabricated using an optical tweezer-based rapid prototyping approach. Colloidal nanoparticle building blocks will be chemically functionalized to bind when brought in contact with each other using the optical tweezers. After the nanophotonic structures have been fabricated on the image sensors, they will be tested under well-controlled lighting conditions using monochromatic laser sources directed at particular angles with particular polarizations, as well as in everyday broad-band, wide-field scenes. A compact and light-weight multimodality imaging device will be created. Its performance will be compared to existing light field imagers, hyperspectral imagers, and polarimeters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their device applications could impact industries such as energy, transportation, communications and medicine. For such a sweeping revolution to occur, there are performance limits to be overcome. A large number of organic semiconductors with high carrier mobility, a measure of how quickly electrons move through a material, have been made. However, charge injection into organic semiconductors remains a bottleneck to the development of high performance devices. The project will confront this challenge through an integrated approach combining experiment and modelling. The goal of this project is to develop methods to describe charge injection into organic semiconductors and reduce the impact of contacts.

With the recent development of very high mobility compounds, the field faces a great challenge: a direct consequence of lowering the resistance of the active electronic layer is that now the contribution of the contact resistance becomes significant. Innovation in device design for reducing the impact of contacts on device performance is urgently needed. The goals of this project are to engineer better devices through minimizing or eliminating the contact effects and to develop a methodology for accurate determination the charge carrier mobility in the presence of severe contact effects. A set of experiments and modelling tasks were designed to allow for a better understanding of charge injection and transport in organic semiconductors, a rigorous device parameter extraction and a drastic reduction in the contact resistance to a level where intrinsic mobility is accessible even for the very high mobility materials.

The indium-aluminum-gallium-nitride materials system has fundamental advantages over the materials that were previously used for making quantum cascade lasers and artificial semiconductor nonlinear optical materials. In particular, indium-aluminum-gallium-nitride semiconductor lasers operating in the terahertz spectral range (frequencies in the range of 1-10 THz) are expected to be able to operate at room temperature, unlike semiconductor lasers previously demonstrated in other materials systems. Room-temperature terahertz semiconductor lasers will have a major transformative impact on the instrumentation operating in this frequency range. Indium-aluminum-gallium-nitride materials are also expected to enable the creation of a novel kind of nonlinear metamaterials for operation at the wavelengths used by fiber-optics telecommunication equipment with sub-1-picosecond response time. Two graduate students will be trained during the course of the program. The two principal investigators will also continue their annual participation in the National Science Foundation research experience for undergraduate program and in various K-12 outreach activities at their institutions.<br/> <br/>Technical Description. <br/>The objective of this proposal is to develop intersubband optoelectronic devices based on strain-compensated InGaN/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on non-polar m-plane GaN substrates for operation in the short-wavelength infrared (wavelengths in the range 1.4-3 microns) and terahertz (wavelengths in the range 30-300 microns) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Current intersubband devices rely on materials with relatively low conduction band offsets (<1 eV) and low longitudinal optical phonon energies (~30-40 meV) that, respectively, prevent intersubband devices from operating in the short-wavelength infrared and limit the operation of terahertz quantum cascade lasers to cryogenic temperatures. GaN/AlGaN heterostructures grown on c-plane substrates have been previously investigated to overcome the abovementioned problems. GaN-based materials system offers conduction band offsets over 2 eV and have optical phonon energies of ~90 meV. However, strain-dependent piezo-electric fields make it virtually impossible to produce desired intersubband bandstructure in practical devices grown on c-plane substrates. Additionally, relatively small heterostructure thickness, limited by strain, and poor optical field confinement in the heterostructure prevented efficient light-matter interaction in devices reported previously. The proposed AlInGaN heterostructures on m-plane GaN substrates are free from strain-induced fields making reliable intersubband bandstructure design possible. Strain-compensation will be used to overcome critical thickness constrains in materials growth. The heterostructures will be further processed into double-metal plasmonic cavities using photoelectrochemical etching for substrate removal to enable efficient light-matter integration. Two types of intersubband devices will be investigated: double-metal waveguide THz QCLs and intersubband nonlinear metasurfaces for operation in the telecommunication spectral range. The former devices represent a viable path towards developing the first room-temperature electrically pumped semiconductor lasers in the THz spectral range, while the latter devices offer a path for developing intersubband metasurfaces with a giant nonlinear response for short-wavelength infrared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a control is typically obtained through the interaction with external, appropriately shaped, electromagnetic fields.  Moreover, one often wants not only to drive the state to a desired value but also to optimize the available resources. The minimization of time is especially important. In applications to computation, fast dynamics result in the speed-up of the implemented algorithms.  Furthermore, in general, the evolution has to occur within the time frame during which the mathematical model can be considered valid, before the effect of un-modeled dynamics becomes relevant. In this context, this research will accomplish three inter-related objectives: 1) It will provide explicit optimal control design algorithms for a large class of quantum mechanical systems very common in important applications.   2) It will provide an in depth mathematical analysis of the role of symmetries in quantum control systems and how these symmetries can be used to simplify mathematical models of quantum systems, thus considerably extending the existing theory.  3) It will validate the mathematical results through experiments in quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance via the collaboration with experimental laboratories.   The overall result will be a rich toolbox for the optimal manipulation of quantum mechanical systems to be used in applications in secure communication, powerful quantum computing, design of measurement devices, medical diagnostics and, in general, every device which uses quantum systems.  The activities will involve an interdisciplinary research team composed of engineers, physicists and mathematicians with the objective of developing a common language and science. The resulting knowledge will be the basis of a new area of engineering and a curriculum in Quantum Engineering, a field that will become very important in the future as the applications of quantum mechanics in everyday life continue to expand.  <br/><br/>The main mathematical tools used and developed in this research come from the field of differential geometry and in particular Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometry. The starting point are the so-called KP mathematical models which are models whose state varies on a Lie group and whose dynamical equations correspond to a Cartan decomposition of the associated Lie algebra. The corresponding optimal control problems are, on one hand, very common in applications, and, on the other hand, explicitly solvable. In the project they serve as a test-bed to investigate properties of quantum control systems in general. These involve the role of symmetries, the qualitative behavior of optimal trajectories (geodesics) and the geometry of the reachable sets.  A key technical ingredient of the mathematical approach is the use of symmetry reduction as a tool to analyze the control problem on a lower dimensional quotient space.  On this space a simpler control problem can be posed and often explicitly solved. This procedure will substantially enlarge the existing toolbox in quantum control, which is frequently restricted to small dimensional systems. The experimental implementations of the resulting control design will be for systems in quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance, which are among the most promising candidates for the construction of quantum computers. Furthermore, the mathematical analysis will require the introduction of elements from the theory of singular and stratified spaces, which is important in other areas of applications of control besides quantum mechanics. In this context, this project will contribute to the development of control theory for classical systems as well."

Unattended hearing loss results in feelings of isolation, loneliness, and extreme frustration. This is especially prevalent in older individuals. Not only does hearing loss severely impair communication, it often leads to delays in spoken language abilities in children. A host of strategies, with varying degrees of success, can be used to reduce the detrimental effects of hearing disability: these range from screening, protection, captioning, sign language, to assistive devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants (CI). CI devices function by coding sound waves as electrical pulses. In turn, these pulses determine the amount of electrical charge applied to neurons in the inner ear (cochlea) thereby conveying a lost or diminished sensation of sound. Approximately 324,000 CI have been implanted worldwide enabling some individuals to perceive speech very well. However, outcomes are highly variable and unpredictable. Everyday situations, such as understanding speech in noisy settings, and appreciating music, present users with significant challenges. A major contributor is the inability of CIs to precisely control the path of electrical charge in the highly conductive intracochlear fluid. This work pursues a promising and novel alternative to direct electrical stimulation - micro-magnetic stimulation via electrically pulsed coils housed on a flexible substrate and implanted in the cochlea. An intracochlear micro-coil array can activate auditory neurons with greater specificity while also enabling longer-term safety since the micro-coils are fully encapsulated. The applicability of micro-magnetic coils can naturally be extended to overcome loss in balance, sight, as well as to improve deep brain stimulation. To further enhance the societal impact of the research, partnerships with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Fernbank Science Center will enable and promote hearing health awareness and education in Atlanta, GA.<br/><br/>The proposed work is a necessary first-step toward advancing an understanding of how locally induced fields may serve to excite neurons. In contrast with transcranial magnetic stimulation requiring a bulky coil and consuming considerable power, micro-coils implanted proximal to target neural tissue may engage the nervous system more effectively. To pursue this research, direct metal inkjet printing methods to build micro-coils on polymeric substrates will be developed. The devices will be fully encapsulated with a medical grade polymer and tested in solution to examine for impedance shifts and leakage current. Ex-vivo testing will also be accomplished with organotypic spiral ganglion neurons cultured on a 2D multichannel electrode array (MEA). The 2D-MEA and associated software system will enable the unprecedented possibility of non-invasive, closed-loop micro-magnetic stimulation and neural response recording. From this, neural threshold and specificity will be assessed and compared with conventional CI electrode-based stimulation. In a parallel and highly collaborative fashion, array insertion studies in human cadaver cochleae to assess insertion trauma, depth of insertion, and scalar wall distances will be pursued. More broadly, the application of novel printing and additive manufacturing, combined with flexible electronics, has the potential to transform fabrication of neural interface technologies to processes outside of the cleanroom, while enabling seamless integration with supporting drive electronics and packaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a front-end is only enabled through exploiting the unique property of Time-Varying Transmission Line. Time-varying transmission line consists of passive transmission lines whose inductance or capacitance is space-time modulated by another electromagnetic wave. It possesses a mixture of passive and active circuit characteristics. First, it is a transmission line that can be engineered and designed to have accurate impedance, phase and delay characteristics in both directions. Furthermore, it offers functions of active circuits such as amplifications and frequency conversions. Devices created out of this novel concept include resonators with accurately controlled resonating frequency yet allowing resonances across different frequencies to couple. This property can be utilized to create low noise, high-quality factor, tunable filtering capability even within miniaturized dimensions.  The proposed effort will first establish a systematic theory of Time-Varying Transmission Line being used as a key building block to achieve superior performance in radio frequency front-ends. This includes various novel developments of functional blocks such as circulators, tunable filters with parametrically enhanced quality factors, low noise amplifiers, active frequency conversion and phase shifting circuits. Modern semiconductor technology will then be utilized for on-chip integration of the proposed devices. The performance bound on practical implementations of the radio frequency front-end will be derived based on these integrated circuit prototypes. Ultimately, new wireless system architectures and applications that fully leverage on the unique features of these devices will be explored for the purpose of meeting the need of emerging wireless communications."

Besides its intensity and color, light is also characterized by its polarization state that can be affected by emission, scattering or transmission of an object. Detecting light polarization has been proven to be essential for various applications such as biomedical diagnostics, remote sensing, target detection and astronomy. Yet, despite the fact that the sensitivity, speed, pixel density and color range of image sensors have been continuously improved, the capability of full-polarization imaging, hasn't been realized on monolithically integrated sensors. This project is to develop a chip-integrated imaging sensor array, or in another word, polarimetric imaging array, to detect not only light intensity and color but also the complete polarization state of light. Such a compact system can be further incorporated into many portable systems for clinic diagnostics, real time environmental monitoring network, or a smartphone polarimeter for field study and research. By integrating research and education, the project is aimed to inspire and cultivate the next-generation of scientists and engineers in nanophotonics and nanotechnology to address grand challenges in health, security, environmental issues and space exploration. In particular, the proposal aims to promote participation in science and engineering (esp. under-represented groups) by engaging undergraduate students in research, showcasing research to K-12 students through outreach and a summer enrichment program. <br/>The scientific objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of integrating artificially engineered planar optics to realize on-chip polarimetric imaging sensor array. Conventional polarimetric sensing and imaging systems are very bulky and require moving parts, which makes it difficult for minimization. Moreover, these systems also suffer from reduced frame rate and inaccuracy of extracted polarization information due to motion in the scene. Monolithic integrated polarimetric imaging systems have been extensively studied; however, these polarimetric imaging systems have various limitations, such as large pixel size, degradation in imaging quality, lack of compatibility with silicon technology and poor accuracy. The proposed technology fully exploits the cutting-edge development in nanophotonics and nanofabrication to provide significantly improved solutions for on-chip polarimetric sensing and imaging applications. All the detection elements are realized based on subwavelength-thick structures directly integrated onto silicon photodetectors. The polarization extinction ratios and transmission efficiency are 30 and >40% in the visible range for all polarization detection elements, respectively. The fabrication process developed in this project is compatible with CMOS technology, and well tolerates a lateral alignment error as large as tens of nanometers.  All these detection elements can be made down to submicrometer size while still maintaining reasonably good performance, feasible for large-scale inexpensive CMOS production. The project will lead to the realization of on-chip polarimetric imaging sensor arrays with high sensitivity and accuracy. Moreover, the research will enable an in-depth understanding of the fundamental device physics and fabrication techniques involved in integrating metasurface flat optics on chip, which is essential for realizing ultra-compact optical system with other unique properties and unprecedented functionalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These types of systems are sometimes called stochastic hybrid systems; where stochastic refers to the presence of random influences and hybrid refers to the mix of logic-based decision making and physical laws that determine the system evolution.   These mathematical tools would be extremely useful, as they would provide a framework enabling control engineers to better design autonomous dynamical systems that are resilient in the face of uncertainty.  The results of this proposal have the potential to impact researchers in a wide variety of application domains, where randomness interacts with worst-case effects and rigorous analysis tools are needed to certify desirable behavior in an engineered system. One possible application domain is the control of gene expression and other particular biological phenomena. Another application area is multi-agent resource allocation algorithms where agents invoke randomness in their allocation strategies to guarantee robustness to malicious agents in the network.  Indeed, stochastic hybrid systems can be used to model complicated biological systems, financial systems, resource allocation systems, and traffic management systems, to name just a few. All of the results developed through this proposal will be published in the leading conference venues and journals, to provide avenues for the transition of the work to applications.  Beyond contributions to the scientific literature, the proposed work will add to the existing graduate curriculum on stochastic and hybrid dynamical systems. Graduate students will be trained through direct financial support, but a broader group of students will be educated through teaching materials and a course that will be developed around the produced breakthroughs. These students include graduate students in all areas of engineering.  To reach students broadly, the PI envisions a graduate textbook on stochastic hybrid systems emerging from this work, to complement the recent book on non-stochastic hybrid systems. The work will spawn collaboration with international researchers, and will enhance student exchange programs with several international universities. The research developments will be applied to areas that are important to the broad population. Moreover, the PI will use this opportunity to consider how to expose freshman engineering students to a broad range of dynamical systems principles. This effort will follow up the previous experience teaching a freshman seminar, to engineering and non-engineering students, on the application of optimization principles to real-world problems. The aim here aligns with the societal goal of keeping younger students engaged in topics related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>The specific technical objectives of the project start with establishing a mathematical framework and solution concept that is tractable yet general enough to be widely applicable.  Tools from the field of variational analysis are crucial to this development.  The objectives continue with the task of developing a wide range of analysis tools that can be used to certify appropriate behavior of an engineered stochastic hybrid system.  The techniques will especially focus on a Lyapunov analysis for stability properties like asymptotic stability in probability and recurrence; other ideas that have been fruitful for non-stochastic hybrid systems also will be considered.   Next, the aim is to establish strong sequential compactness results for the set of solutions to the models considered and, from these results, establish an invariance principle and converse Lyapunov theorems.  These results would parallel recent, very useful results for non-stochastic hybrid systems.

Swift identification of a viral pathogen can enable a rapid healthcare response for arresting major outbreaks, and even for speedy drug development. This pressing need is highlighted by outbreaks of H1N1, H5N1, SARS, and Ebolavirus over the last decade. Simultaneous sensing of optical and mechanical properties of viruses could permit the rapid identification of individual virus particles without any chemical tests. This is a new perspective in comparison to existing optical-only or mechanical-only methods that provide limited information. This proposal addresses the associated fundamental problems of measurement throughput, sensitivity, and particle identification by means of a novel nanofluidic opto-mechanical resonator. Such devices could some day be deployed in the field for the label-free identification of viral pathogens, and for generating a swift response by healthcare authorities. In pharmacological studies, these devices could assist in drug discovery.<br/><br/>The proposed work is fundamentally interdisciplinary and of high value from an educational perspective. This project provides rich opportunities for the training of students at all<br/>levels (graduate, undergraduate, high school) at the intersection of optical physics, solid mechanics, and fluid mechanics, using advanced experimental tools. The STEM education impact of this work will be broadened through the development and distribution of educational activities on the optical measurement of Brownian motion of microparticles. These activities will be<br/>targeted towards K-12 students at local schools, with wider distribution through existing on-campus partners. An undergraduate research assistant will also be recruited for the research and educational efforts with preference towards underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>3b Technical abstract<br/><br/>Currently, fast label-free techniques for detecting viral nanoparticles rely on either photonic sensing or on vibrational mass sensing, but not both, and can only provide limited one-dimensional information. For instance, mechanical methods primarily operate on the principle of mass-loading of a resonator and the associated frequency. In this manner, the mass of a particle can be estimated with extremely high resolution, but size and density are not obtainable without additional assumptions. Photonic methods, in contrast, rely on the shift of optical resonance frequency or optical mode splitting. This provides information on the polarizability, approximate size of a nanoparticle, but does not permit further identification. As a result, there remains an ambiguity in the label-free identification of a pathogen (as opposed to mere detection) without the use of specific antibody binding or chemical processes. Having both optical and mechanical properties can shed much needed light on a single virion's size, mass density, and optical density (or polarizability), and could help narrow down the protein folding and virus structural properties.<br/><br/>This project has multiple objectives <br/>(1) Elucidate the fundamental limits of sensing single virions with simultaneous optomechanical measurements using a nano-optomechanofluidic device. <br/>(2) Develop models of optical as well as mechanical noise sources, and incorporate the effects of radiation pressure and optomechanical back-action.<br/>(3) Develop a method of throughput enhancement in mechanical resonance sensing, by using simultaneous optical information to spatiotemporally locate the nanoparticles.<br/>(4) Improve the ability to detect and identify single virus particles, not only based on their optical properties but also their mass, through the use of nano-optomechanofluidic resonators."

While major commercial products have started to emerge, the well-known reliability problem of EWOD devices is hampering the continued growth. A UCLA team from the engineering and medical school proposes to explore a phenomenon opposite to electrowetting, thus named electrodewetting, after finding it has a droplet manipulation capability similar to EWOD without the reliability problem. Noting the high reliability and easy manufacturing of electrodewetting-based devices, the team proposes to study the origin of electrodewetting, characterize the mechanism, and build the fundamental knowledge that will help design application devices. The proposed electrodewetting study is expected to significantly increase the user base of digital (droplet) microfluidics, which is powered by EWOD technology currently. Attractive to users of all levels and different goals regardless of their expertise and interests, electrodewetting devices are expected to serve both academic and industrial researchers as well as some hobbyists because of their simplicity and reliability. The proposed work requires an interdisciplinary approach in research and training on issues ranging from basic electrical engineering, surface science, and microfabrication, all the way to optical and biochemical applications. Graduate students will gain first-hand experience from this interdisciplinary research and be well prepared to be future leaders. Undergraduate and high school students will carry out tasks in a vertical team of researchers. The results will enrich the engineering curricula, including the MEMS/Nano PhD program at UCLA. <br/>      <br/>While providing all the basic digital microfluidic functions of EWOD, electrodewetting avoids the key problems of EWOD. First, electrodewetting uses a hydrophilic substrate with neither the dielectric layer nor the hydrophobic topcoat. These coated layers needed for EWOD are the main culprits to its reliability problem and high manufacturing cost. Hydrophilic surfaces, such as glass, are common to many diverse applications spanning biomedical, optical, chemical, and other fields. Importantly, this simplicity would also make the design and manufacturing of electrodewetting devices easy and cheap. Second, electrodewetting typically uses only ~3 V for actuation. This low voltage allows the use off-the-shelf integrated circuits so the developers can quickly build a compact system, which is especially useful for mobile applications. Third, droplets can be split into smaller ones in an open configuration with no cover plate, allowing more flexibility in device design. In the proposed study, based on hypotheses carefully constructed from preliminary experiments and observations, the UCLA team will elucidate how the electrodewetting mechanism works, understand how it responds to device parameters, build the fundamental engineering knowledge for device design, and explore applications by developing an electronic display device. The underlying goal is to develop knowledge foundation that will assist other researchers and developers who would like to adopt this elegantly simple liquid handling technology for their own applications."

The confined light becomes much more sensitive to environmental changes, exerts an amplified mechanical force, and can generate significant nonlinear effects even at small light intensities. For this reason, optical microresonators are being actively studied in the context of optical cooling or amplification of mechanical motion, for precision metrology, lasing, ultrasensitive biosensing and other areas. Confinement of light is usually achieved using solid materials, but this project proposes to achieve it using liquid microstructures. The transition to liquid droplet creates significant challenges, but also opens up new opportunities. Firstly, mechanical softness of droplets makes them more receptive than solid materials to the light-induced forces resulting in many orders of magnitude larger mechanical responses and hence increased efficiency of optical cooling or heating. Secondly, liquid droplets allow access to the resonator's interior regions. Because electromagnetic field is orders of magnitude larger inside than outside of the resonator, one can expect the corresponding increase in sensitivity of biosensors based on droplet resonators by several orders of magnitude. Thirdly, use of liquid droplets allows realizing a novel class of photonic molecules with extra strong optical bonds based on droplet-in-droplet structures, in which one or more smaller droplets are encapsulated in a larger droplet. Overall, the objective of this project is to demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid droplet resonators in the fields of optical cooling, lasing, sensing and metrology. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, which includes physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, will ensure that graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to the culture and methodology of different disciplines. In addition, the project will build connections between American and Israeli researchers and students and strengthen the collaboration between American universities participating in the project and Technion, Israel's premiere engineering school.

The international multidisciplinary team formed for this project will exploit state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies to fabricate different structures of droplets, with each droplet serving as a high-quality photonic resonator. Numerical simulation and theoretical models will be developed to understand the physics associated with the novel structures developed in the project. Experimentalists working on the project will carry out optical characterization of the proposed structures and develop in-depth understanding of their novel optical and optomechanical effects. This research will advance the field of optofluidics by applying state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies to the fabrication of novel microfluidic devices and generation of complex structures of microdroplets. Study of novel photonic structures with unique properties will also open new directions in the field of optical whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The general field of computational electrodynamics will also benefit from this work by taking the T-matrix formalism well outside its nominal domain and applying it to the modes of optically coupled complex structures of liquid droplets."

Currently, only 1% of the total US electricity is generated by solar power. The main challenge for the widespread implementation of solar cells as a source of electricity is the current high cost/Watt. Hybrid perovskites are a very promising new material for manufacturing low-cost photovoltaic modules, but improvement in device stability is essential so that this emerging material can be effectively employed as a photovoltaic technology. In particular, it is unknown how the device performance changes when the perovskite, composed by micron-scale grains, is exposed to humidity. To advance the understanding of how the grains' electrical properties are changing while the solar cells are under operation (and exposed to humidity), this project will implement a novel microscopy technique to resolve, in real-time, the changes that take place within the grains forming the perovskites. These ""nanoscale photographs"" of the electrical response of the perovskites will be used to determine which physical and chemical processes should be avoided for the realization of stable devices. The integrated educational component of this project focuses on incorporating the research findings into two existing courses in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Maryland, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and broadcasting the scientific results through the LeiteLab YouTube Channel in different languages for worldwide dissemination.  <br/><br/>Technical description of the project: <br/>Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites based on methyl-ammonium lead iodide are an emerging material with true potential for being a high performance and low cost photovoltaic technology.

The goal of this research is to elucidate the role of humidity in perovskite solar cells by measuring in real-time, with nanoscale resolution, the changes that take place when the perovskite material degrades. By implementing fast illuminated-Kelvin probe force microscopy the Leite group will map the photo-generated voltage in 16 seconds; thus, capturing in real-time the material changes while the device is in operando. This project builds upon the PI's expertise in nanoscale metrologies to image the functionality of devices for energy harvesting and storage. Controlling the negative effect of humidity on perovskites will enable the wide implementation of this material as a reliable and low cost photovoltaic technology."

Instead of their conventional role as artificially structured materials with exotic optical properties, plasmonic metamaterials will be exploited to serve as a complete and generalizable electro-optic platform with intrinsically embedded electrical functions and optical nonlinearity. In particular, effective second-order nonlinear processes will be electrically enabled and actively controlled, thanks to the breaking of inversion symmetry induced by a low-frequency electric field or accumulation of electric charges. Central themes of the research include electrically-induced nonlinear optical generation in photonic metamaterials, and electrically-controlled nonlinear characterization with plasmonics in aqueous systems.

To reach this goal, it is proposed in this project to break the distribution system into many small power systems (e.g., the power system of a neighborhood), each called a micro-grid (MG).  Each MG of the multiple-MG distribution system architecture can have one or more power generation sources (including renewable generation) and loads. Each MG and the components of the MG have an intelligent agent (i.e., a computer).  These agents will have local information about the MG and its components, and they can communicate with their neighboring MGs and collectively will determine the best operating scenario of the generating sources and loads within the MG, based on the availability of resource and the market price of electricity they receive from the utility.<br/> <br/> Under normal condition, the MGs are interconnected and together they form the power distribution grid.  However, in the event of an electrical fault, the MGs can separate from one another, and the isolated faulty MG can go under repair while the healthy MGs will continue operating and be controlled independently and connect in network. When the faulty MG is repaired, it will return to service, and the MGs will form the original interconnected architecture and return to normal operation.  <br/> <br/> The fundamental issues the project seeks to address through the proposed approach is:  it is much easier to monitor and control each MG compared to the large power system.

In addition, the proposed real-time characterization methods can provide powerful analysis tools for continuous monitoring of cell mechanisms, fluid dynamics or chemical reaction kinetics. <br/>This project also provides an opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students at the intersection of laser physics, systems engineering, materials science, and real-time characterization to build a new generation of multi-faceted researchers to tackle the interdisciplinary nature of technological and societal challenges in the future. The PI will organize professional networking and mentoring opportunities through a Boston-wide Photonics Networking series that highlights female engineers. This aims to bring together a diverse group of engineers and scientists and to encourage underrepresented minorities in the field. <br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>The PI proposes to develop a real-time measurement system to analyze the pulse-to-pulse evolution simultaneously with phase coherence in thulium-holmium doped fiber lasers around 2 micron wavelengths as well as for erbium doped fiber lasers in 1.5 micron region. The proposal aims at exploring and characterizing transient effects, rapid fluctuations and nonlinear pulse dynamics on a pulse-by-pulse basis for ultrafast fiber lasers, e.g. at the verge of mode-locking. A modified time-stretching technique based on dispersive Fourier transform is to be developed to capture pulse behavior on a single pulse scale. Systematic studies aimed at resolving the intricate interplay between different pulse shaping mechanisms in fibers will lead to fundamental insights into pulse dynamics and transient states that can be applied to design novel laser cavities, resolve polarization evolution and optimize performance parameters."

The canonical biomarker test format for point-of-care (POC) applications is the lateral flow assay based on paper test strips which is cheap, disposable, easy to use and requires no additional hardware. However, the advantages are obtained at the expense of low sensitivity and limited quantitative measurement results. Gold standards for genetic detection and immunoassays utilize fluorescence-based detection, which offers low detection limit, high reliability, and capability of multiplexed analysis. While highly-accurate, fluorescence detection typically requires multiple optical components, making instrumentation bulky and costly for POC tests. The goal of this project is to develop a new POC testing platform that combines the benefits of high-sensitivity and quantitative analysis of fluorescence-based assays, and the simplicity, portability, and cost-effectiveness of lateral flow tests. The platform utilizes optical metamaterials-integrated photodiode array circuits to convert the enhanced fluorescence sensing signals into amplified electrical readouts to achieve sensitive detection without optical components. The lens-free design promises device miniaturization and facilitates the on-chip integration of microfluidic devices for lateral flow tests. The project fosters the development of a diverse science and engineering workforce with a deep understanding of optics at nanoscales, biosensing technology, and circuit integration. The result of the project will lead to a scalable solution that enables a sensitive, self-contained, quantitative lateral flow assay. This leverages the power and economies of scale of modern silicon integrated circuits, built up over the previous fifty years for high-performance computation and imaging, for a low-cost, bioelectronic sensing application.<br/>The key to the success of the proposed approach is to generate enhanced fluorescence and directional light emission by managing the coupling between the fluorescent reporters (fluorophores or quantum dots) on biological probes and the resonance of an optical metamaterial (Aim1). The optical metamaterials composed of metal and dielectric nanostructures exploit surface plasmons to control light. The composition of the metamaterial will be engineered to regulate the spontaneous emission rate of proximate fluorescent reporters and thus boost their emission intensity. Also, the structure of the metamaterial is designed to narrow the radiation pattern of light emission that allows guiding the light toward the photodetector for efficient optical detection. The project explores novel nanofabrication methods based on nanoparticle assembly and thin-film depositions to create large-area nanostructures for the optical metamaterials without sophisticated lithography. Monolithic integration of the metamaterial structures onto photodetector array integrated circuit (IC) substrate allows for detection of metamaterial enhanced fluorescence without optical lenses (Aim 2). A custom CMOS photodetector array IC also provides on-chip signal processing and digitization of all sensors in parallel with a simple, digital readout. A multiplexed sensor will be achieved through addressable functionalization of probe arrays on the integrated sensor substrate. Packaging of the sensor IC with microfluidic delivery using a coplanar wafer-level molding technique will result in a sensitive, miniaturized fluorescence detection platform for POC testing (Aim 3). The proposed work will elucidate the fundamentals of light-matter interactions at nanoscales, create new biosensing technologies, and design guidelines for integration of optical nanostructures, microfluidics, and CMOS ICs for a broad set of future applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is key need for real-time measurements, for example during cancer surgery where leaving unidentified cancer cells behind leads to increased cancer recurrence.  Unfortunately, current techniques cannot identify biological molecules without the use of secondary molecules with a signaling tag attached, necessitating multiple steps often in a laboratory setting.  Therefore there is a need for rapid identification of cells and molecules to guide real-time clinical decision making. <br/><br/> The Solution: To enable direct, and near instantaneous, identification of molecules and single cells, this proposal measures their innate response to extremely high frequency electrical fields to identify a unique frequency signature.  In particular, this project aims to extend the ability to measure these characteristic vibrations into the Terahertz range, with electric fields alternating within a picosecond.  At these speeds, the vibrations of molecules are measured, potentially identifying biological molecules without the use of secondary labels.  <br/><br/>Advancing the Field: The overarching goal of this research is to establish the frequency characteristics for a wide range of biomolecules and cancer cell lines using a single-cell high frequency measurement platform.  If unique spectral signatures of cancer cells are found, the possibility of rapid labelless identification can be realized.  <br/><br/>Benefits to Society:  Of key importance in cancer therapy is the need to identify and treat all disease.  Instantaneous identification of tumor cells, made possible by measuring the innate electrical properties of the molecules themselves, enables instantaneous assessment of tissue to guide resection of all tumor cells.<br/>Furthermore, measurements on single cells at this frequency have never been done before.  Through publications, this information will be disseminated to the community, potentially enabling new biomedical applications.<br/><br/>Education and Diversity: The educational goals of this research include the training of graduate student researchers in the art and science of terahertz signal generation, detection, and processing, and the development of a new undergraduate curriculum targeting freshman electrical engineering students and outreach to underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/> <br/>The focus of this research proposal is to enable labelless investigation of biological systems by obtaining wide frequency spectrum information on the molecular and cellular level through development of a sensor platform operating from DC to the THz regime.  This capability, coupled with microfluidics that enable single cell interrogation, has an immense advantage in the characterization, identification, and, possibly diagnosis of disease, potentially solving a variety of problems faster, less expensively, or perhaps even in a point of care settings.  This research will advance the state-of-the-art by 10X in frequency and allows for inexpensive and rapid Terahertz cell and biomolecule characterization.  Combining Giga and Terahertz sensing allows a broad range of information to be gathered on individual cells and biomolecules. Moving to higher frequencies, from 100 GHz to 1 THz, opens up the possibility to sense molecular rotational resonance signatures, identifying key molecular components of cells.<br/> <br/>The work is divided into three interrelated thrusts.  In the first thrust, the focus is on the development of the DC-THz sensor array.  Our group has identified powerful architectures that are amenable to integration in CMOS, built around performing interferometry between on-chip voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), which are easily integrated in CMOS technology into a very small area.  The architecture has high sensitivity and immunity from phase noise.  In the second thrust, we will be co-designing the microfluidic package and sensor interface so that we can reliably and repeatedly flow materials such as biomolecules or cells into the sensor to perform measurements (1 THz for biomolecules, 0.5 THz for cells). In the third thrust, we will begin an extensive study of the spectral signature of biomolecules and cells from microwave bands up to the terahertz regime."

Since their development in the early part of the new century, optical combs have enabled remarkable advances in precision measurement of time and frequency, which are critical to position and inertial guidance, and in high-speed spectroscopy useful for applications such as environmental sensing and breath analysis. However, these combs are generated from specialized lasers, which are rather bulky, which still hinders their deployment for many real world applications. Furthermore, the pulses they emit are limited to relatively low repetition rates.  Substantially higher repetition rates are needed for other promising applications, such as optical communications, photonics-based radio-frequency signal processing, and calibration of certain astronomical instruments.  More recently, a new choice for generating optical frequency combs has emerged, based on the interaction of light with tiny ""microresonator"" structures on integrated photonic chips.  These microresonator-based comb generators are fundamentally very small, which offers new opportunities for low cost deployment, and provide much higher repetition rate, which offers compatibility with new applications.  Research at Purdue University will explore methods to overcome challenges in guiding the optical combs generated from microresonators into stable and repeatable low-noise states desirable for applications and will provide advanced training to students at the graduate and undergraduate level relevant to careers in high technology and science.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Continuous-wave pumping of a high quality factor microresonator can give rise to formation of combs of optical frequencies spaced by tens to hundreds of GHz.  Such combs arise due to nonlinear wave mixing mediated by the optical Kerr effect and are frequently termed Kerr combs.  In a particularly interesting state, the comb comprises cavity solitons (more formally called dissipative Kerr solitons), ultrashort pulses of light that propagate in the microresonator with remarkable stability, thanks to a double balance between loss and parametric gain and between dispersion and nonlinearity.  However, controlling the nonlinear dynamics to achieve the desired stable states of operation is complex.  One complication is that the comb evolves through a chaotic regime before it potentially switches into a stable cavity soliton state; the passage through chaos leads to strong indeterminacy in the state generated.  Competition with thermo-optic nonlinearities that are exacerbated by power transients that occur upon transition into the soliton state cause further challenges.  Although progress has been made, control strategies to deal with these issues are particularly challenging for desirable chip-scale microresonator devices.  This project proposes to explore two new approaches to guiding the evolution of the comb to desired states, including single soliton states, within the rich, nonlinear dynamical phase space.  One approach investigates the idea of a so-called chaos-avoiding trajectory involving coordinated manipulation of pump laser power and frequency to reach stable soliton states without passing through the chaotic operating regime usually encountered.  A second complementary approach will explore a recently proposed passive scheme toward obtaining single solitons based on mode interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed design will eliminate the need for expensive and inefficient cavity stabilization electronics and will push the boundaries in various fields including: nonlinear optics, semiconductor lasers, cavity design, and ultrafast pulse generation. As part of the research, a new VECSEL gain material will be designed and grown to deliver the large gain bandwidth needed for short pulse generation while still providing high peak powers. This new gain material combined with a semiconductor absorber mirror in a t-cavity configuration will allow development of a new laser source that can enable future advancements in science, medicine, material processing, and engineering research.

Two undergraduate students are to be involved each year for summer and/or academic internship.  <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The proposed research will implement a novel t-cavity configuration for fourth harmonic generation and eliminate the need for cavity stabilization electronics. Typically, fourth harmonic generation to the UV uses a source laser that is coupled into a series of external resonator cavities that recirculate the fundamental and second harmonic modes. These external cavities are very sensitive to minor movements which lead to phase variations of the beams and to large power fluctuations of the UV output. This situation requires that each cavity have their resonances locked to ensure stable outputs. Such systems are large, complicated, and expensive which limits their potential use outside of a laboratory environment. The proposed research will eliminate the need of the external cavity due to the all-internal nature of the design. Here, the fundamental field is frequency doubled in a nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal for second harmonic generation. As the frequency doubled field is orthogonally polarized to the fundamental, an intra-cavity polarizing beam splitter expels this field into an alternate cavity path. While this is not a resonant cavity, the difficulty of injecting the light into an external resonator is eliminated. The second harmonic is generated inside this cavity and creates a large field in which another NLO crystal can efficiently frequency double this field to the UV. While stabilization electronics would improve the field build-up in the cavity, the research is focused on obtaining a stable high peak power output without additional elements."

Due to fundamental limitations of commonly used semiconductors, this range is currently inaccessible with any other semiconductor lasers. This project exploits the unique properties of nitride semiconductors. However, the nitrides also present some unique challenges related to their atomic structure and built-in electric fields. To overcome these challenges the researchers employ sophisticated modeling tools to design new laser structures. The materials are then grown using molecular beam epitaxy, a technique that allows control of the nitride thicknesses at the nanoscale, and characterized with structural and optical techniques. Finally, laser devices are fabricated and tested to study their performance under different operating conditions and to further refine the design parameters.These novel lasers have the potential to impact a number of technological applications with broad benefits to society. The applications loosely fit into one of two main categories: THz spectroscopy, and THz imaging. THz spectroscopy is currently used in fields ranging from astronomy, and atmospheric science, to plasma fusion diagnostics and bio-chemical weapons detection. THz imaging has broad applications from airport security to medical imaging. This research program also provides unique interdisciplinary research opportunities to a diverse group of students at Purdue University.

These lasers utilize intersubband transitions in the conduction band of non-polar III-nitride heterostructures and employ the general operating principles of quantum cascade lasers. The technical approach involves using low Al-composition, non-polar nitride heterostructures (AlInGaN/GaN) grown on high quality free-standing m-plane GaN substrates to mitigate material quality and design issues that have, so far, impeded progress of nitride intersubband devices. The choice of polarization-free m-plane heterostructures has the tremendous advantage of eliminating the effect of built-in electric fields at hetero-interfaces. The research effort is interdisciplinary in nature and involves material design and growth, structural and optical material characterization, waveguide design and fabrication, and finally device testing.This research will enable a novel compact, coherent, tunable THz light source with power output suitable for technological applications (milliwatt level). In addition to broader wavelength flexibility, the THz nitride lasers are expected to have superior performance in terms of operating temperature and efficiency at the longer wavelengths currently accessible with GaAs THz quantum cascade lasers.  The research focuses on THz lasers using non-polar nitrides, but the knowledge acquired is also relevant to nitride optoelectronic devices operating in other spectral ranges such as the near-infrared (telecom) range. Moreover, the acquired knowledge is valuable for other types of devices, such as transistors, and to other material systems. This research program also brings about important contributions to the physics of optical transitions and vertical charge transport in nitride materials. Elaborate modeling tools and techniques are developed to predict and explain real device behavior. Moreover, this project considerably advances knowledge regarding molecular beam epitaxy of III-nitride materials with the atomic-layer precision and exact reproducibility necessary for complex infrared devices."

The confined light becomes much more sensitive to environmental changes, exerts an amplified mechanical force, and can generate significant nonlinear effects even at small light intensities. For this reason, optical microresonators are being actively studied in the context of optical cooling or amplification of mechanical motion, for precision metrology, lasing, ultrasensitive biosensing and other areas. Confinement of light is usually achieved using solid materials, but this project proposes to achieve it using liquid microstructures. The transition to liquid droplet creates significant challenges, but also opens up new opportunities. Firstly, mechanical softness of droplets makes them more receptive than solid materials to the light-induced forces resulting in many orders of magnitude larger mechanical responses and hence increased efficiency of optical cooling or heating. Secondly, liquid droplets allow access to the resonator's interior regions. Because electromagnetic field is orders of magnitude larger inside than outside of the resonator, one can expect the corresponding increase in sensitivity of biosensors based on droplet resonators by several orders of magnitude. Thirdly, use of liquid droplets allows realizing a novel class of photonic molecules with extra strong optical bonds based on droplet-in-droplet structures, in which one or more smaller droplets are encapsulated in a larger droplet. Overall, the objective of this project is to demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid droplet resonators in the fields of optical cooling, lasing, sensing and metrology. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, which includes physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, will ensure that graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to the culture and methodology of different disciplines. In addition, the project will build connections between American and Israeli researchers and students and strengthen the collaboration between American universities participating in the project and Technion, Israel's premiere engineering school. The support for this project is provided within the collaborative NSF-BSF (Binational US-IL Science Foundation) program with participation of the Israel team financed by BSF.<br/><br/>This project merges the fields of microfluidics and optical whispering-gallery- mode resonators by proposing the study of the optical and optomechanical properties of novel photonic structures composed of fluid droplets. The mechanical softness of liquid droplets combined with their versatility and tunability will allow the principal investigators to study novel optical and optomechanical effects such as optical cooling of capillary waves, topological energy transfer in the vicinity of exceptional points, and others. The international multidisciplinary team formed for this project will exploit state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies to fabricate different structures of droplets, with each droplet serving as a high-quality photonic resonator. Numerical simulation and theoretical models will be developed to understand the physics associated with the novel structures developed in the project. Experimentalists working on the project will carry out optical characterization of the proposed structures and develop in-depth understanding of their novel optical and optomechanical effects. This research will advance the field of optofluidics by applying state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies to the fabrication of novel microfluidic devices and generation of complex structures of microdroplets. Study of novel photonic structures with unique properties will also open new directions in the field of optical whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The general field of computational electrodynamics will also benefit from this work by taking the T-matrix formalism well outside its nominal domain and applying it to the modes of optically coupled complex structures of liquid droplets."

In current power grids, on-load tap-changing (OLTC) electromagnetic transformers, and step-voltage regulators have been commonly used for voltage conversion and control.  However, the tap-changing mechanisms used in OLTC transformers and step-voltage regulators are typically a mechanical mechanism or an electromechanical mechanism with a slow response and can only adjust the voltage ratio of the transformer or regulator in discrete steps.  Therefore, OLTC transformers and step-voltage regulators cannot meet the requirement for flexible, continuous, and fast-acting voltage conversion or control for future smart power grids.  The current alternative is the solid-state transformer (SST).  However, SSTs are currently still limited by voltage and power ratings of the solid-state devices and available circuit topologies.  Moreover, when compared to traditional electromagnetic transformers, SSTs would require more complicated and expensive thermal management and may have a shorter life expectancy.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will explore and prove a novel concept for a magnetoelectric transformer with a continuous and quickly adjustable voltage ratio for flexible, fast-acting voltage conversion and control to help secure the electricity supply, accommodate more renewable energy integration, and reduce the cost of electricity delivery.  In addition, the project team will build a thriving, diversified electric power and energy program through the integration of graduate and undergraduate research and teaching with K-12 outreach.

In particular, phased array antennas are sought after in next generation mobile communications as well as wireless communications for military, space, and satellites. The proposed research aims to fundamentally advance the technical approach and methodologies of designing state-of-the-art phased array antennas consisting of reconfigurable radiating elements, featuring wide-angle scanning capabilities, adaptive aperture distributions, and multi-functional radiation properties. It has promising applications in mobile and wireless systems for homeland security, unmanned vehicles, surveillance, remote sensing, automotive radars, intelligent transportation, etc. In addition to the research advancements that will have immediate impacts on the emerging wireless communications, the project will also bring important long-term societal benefits. To address the noticeable shortage of antenna engineers and scientists, the proposed work will significantly contribute to the training of students by integrating education and research in antennas and applied electromagnetics, thus sustaining the U.S. competitiveness in advanced wireless communications. The educational component of the proposed work is focused on developing inter-disciplinary antenna courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The outreach plan is to foster local community college participation in antenna research activities, engage K-12 students in workshops held at UAH, and attract young students, particularly from underrepresented groups, to study Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>The proposed research aims to address existing challenges of near-the-horizon beam scanning antennas with reconfigurable radiation characteristics and, for the first time, investigate adaptive phased array antennas with electronically controlled inter-element spacing. These are realized by utilizing adaptive antenna elements that can facilitate developing radiation matched elements for null steering and wide-angle beam scanning, without compromising desired antenna radiation properties. More importantly, the antenna elements provide unique features through changing their effective source of radiation, and thus allowing electronic control of the array element spacing without using any mechanical means. The proposed research provides a basis to further test the hypothesis of virtual array antennas, since each element of the proposed phased array antenna can be virtually displaced from its physical center. This enables new levels of real-time control of the array aperture fields by reconfiguring both amplitude patterns and phase distributions at the element level, as well as generating wide-angle scanned beams and adaptive radiation patterns at the array level. This will in turn lead to versatile functionality, reduced sidelobe levels, and suppressed grating lobes in the proposed array antenna. The proposed new technique of antenna reconfiguration has promising potential for the future generation of adaptive phased array antennas."

Protein biomarkers circulating in human body fluids have a great potential to be used in the clinic to indicate diseases. To date, the poor sensitivity and high cost are still the key challenges prohibiting a practical point-of-care diagnostic test based on quantifying low-abundance disease biomarkers. In this project, the investigator aims to establish a low-cost, high sensitivity, multiplexed, rapid, and automated paradigm based upon a hybrid sensor in conjunction with a new readout modality that can perform biomarker analysis for disease diagnostics. The project focuses on investigating the paper-based nanophotonics that integrates photonic crystal devices and paper-based microfluidics, and on how to exploit the unique optical phenomena enabled by the photonic crystal for the biomarker detection with high sensitivity and specificity. In particular, the inexpensive integration of nanophotonic devices with paper substrates that can filter and transport body fluid samples is being addressed. The low-cost and disposable feature of the sensor is highly desirable in resource-limited settings, such as bedside test, remote military deployment, and developing countries. In addition, the sensor is ready to be modified for the detection of pathogenic species that causes server diseases, such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV.

The novelty of the proposed works lies in two facts: i) the integration of photonic crystal and paper as a flow-through sensor platform and ii) the application of a photoacoustics-based readout scheme. In particular, the project will be carried out by combining numerical models and experiments according to the following three specific research objectives: i) integration of photonic crystal and paper-based microfluidics, ii) establishment of photonic crystal-enhanced photoacoustic detection for paper-based biosensor, and iii) multiplexed detection for in-vitro disease diagnostics. The project outcome will fill a significant gap between optofluidics and point-of-care tests by addressing challenging questions including: What are the fluid transport phenomena in a photonic crystal-paper hybrid system?

In the last decade nanoscience, phenomena at length scales orders of magnitude smaller than the microscale, has played an increasingly larger role in the development of widespread technology such as nanoscale semiconductor devices, nanoparticle based therapies in medicine, and sensors that can measure minute forces and signals from biological as well as inanimate physical systems. Likewise, nanotechnology has also furthered our understanding of fundamental scientific phenomena at the nanoscale, such as the electronic structure of two-dimensional materials that promise to usher in the next generation of high-speed wearable electronic devices, images of intrinsic vibrational modes capable of sub-cellular classification and local presence of important proteins in biophysical systems. Probing, and in particular, optical probing at the nanoscale is thus of paramount importance to help lead the next revolution in science and technology much like the optical microscope did in the microscopic world. Our proposed optical fiber vortex light source will provide two to three orders of magnitude signal enhancement and background reduction in devices that can optically resolve nanoscale phenomena.<br/><br/>Technical description: The goal of this proposed program is to develop a tip-enhanced near-field microscopy system that retains all the advantages of current scattering type near-field scanning optical microscopes, including the ability to probe the amplitude and phase response of materials in the nanometer scale using well-established elastic or inelastic scattering techniques, but with an increased throughput by several orders of magnitude (simulations suggest the possibility of 75% efficiencies, as opposed to 0.1-0.2% in current implementations). This will reduce background problems that have limited the application of current implementations of tip-enhanced microscopy systems. The primary intellectual significance of achieving program goals will be the realization of a nanoscale microscopy system that can probe signals orders of magnitude weaker than currently possible, aided by the dramatic reductions in background that an optical fiber-based nanoscale tip would enable. In the proposed effort we will use fiber tapering, electrochemical etching techniques, and precision metal deposition techniques to adiabatically convert the stable radially polarized optical modes in the fiber into plasmonic modes at the fiber tip, as required for tip-enhanced microscopy. The adiabatic mode transformation, as opposed to external illumination as is currently employed, will be the key differentiator between current tip-enhanced microscopy systems and the proposed device, as this is expected to yield the two-to-three orders of magnitude increase in signal throughput and corresponding decrease in background."

Moreover, new and emerging device concepts promise to open this largely-inaccessible spectrum to further scientific study as well as important applications in imaging, non-destructive test and evaluation, and high-bandwidth communications. Unfortunately, the infrastructure and measurement tools needed to develop these new technologies remain severely limited. Current approaches to realizing measurement instrumentation at submillimeter wavelengths are based largely on a modular approach using waveguide interfaces. This results in fully-assembled measurement apparatus with considerable geometric footprint that can prove unwieldy or unsuitable for many important scenarios, for example in situations when the device or system to test must be maintained within a shielded enclosure such as a vacuum chamber or cryostat. This project is focused on addressing this critical issue through the development of compact and low-profile measurement instruments that are based on high-performance terahertz sensors heterogeneously integrated with micromachined support membranes that allow direct-contact in situ characterization of planar devices and systems at terahertz frequencies. As a consequence, this work will have broad impact on the growing terahertz research community through the availability of new and advanced metrological instrumentation that permit measurements that presently are not possible or feasible. The creation of new measurement techniques and capabilities is fundamental to the advancement of science; scientific discovery and progress in engineering are predicated on the creation of instruments that open new physical domains for experimentation and inquiry.  This work represents an initial, critical, and necessary step towards developing instruments that overcome the inherent drawbacks limiting current approaches to terahertz metrology.<br/><br/>The goal and scope of this project is to advance the infrastructure for measurement and characterization of terahertz devices, components, and systems through the development of instrumentation technologies that are based on heterogeneous integration. The research pursued focuses on heterogeneous integration across materials systems (e.g., III-V semiconductors and silicon) and across physical domains (e.g., electronics and mechanics). Towards this end, the specific approach to be undertaken includes three primary thrusts: (1) development of processing technologies for low-parasitic terahertz Schottky diode sensors heterogeneously integrated onto thin silicon membranes, (2) investigation and implementation of silicon membrane-based micromachined on-wafer probes incorporating integrated Schottky sensors, and (3) research and prototyping of compact, high-order terahertz frequency multiplier sources for integration with test and measurement instrumentation based on heterogeneous integration.  There is inherent intellectual merit in researching processes that enable such integration and a significant effort of this proposal is dedicated to investigating methods that permit fabrication of high-performance terahertz electronic sensors with mechanically-robust host substrates amenable to direct, physical contact interfaces without need for fixturing.

The scope of the research includes: i) realizing high aspect ratio Ga2O3 3D channel structures using the non-destructive MacEtch technology; ii) developing MOCVD growth, doping, and regrowth of AlGaO on the MacEtch-produced non-planar Ga2O3 structures; iii) characterizing the MacEtched Ga2O3 surfaces and the regrown GaO/AlGaO hetero-interfaces chemically, structurally, optically, and electrically; and iv) demonstrating GaO/AlGaO HEMTs with non-planar 3D channels. The proposed GaO/AlGaO HEMT structure, with the non-planar 3D topology and the complex monoclinic crystal structure, provides a unique platform to explore the crystal orientation dependent etching, growth rate, AlGaO composition, GaO/AlGaO interface defects, and dopant/impurity incorporation. The intellectual significance of the project will establish fundamental understanding of the carrier generation and mass transport properties in MacEtch of Ga2O3 as a function of metal catalyst pattern and its alignment with surface orientation, crystal doping concentration, and ultra-violet light illumination wavelength and intensity, as well as the etching mechanism for wide bandgap oxide semiconductors in general.  Surface and interface characterization will provide insights in the contributing and limiting factors in vacancy and other defects related traps and establish control process for different device architecture requirements. Beyond the proposed program, the platform and innovative concepts to be explored can also be used for many other types of devices for size scaling and performance enhancement, including optoelectronics devices such as solar blind ultraviolet (UV) detectors and high temperature flame sensors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scaling, however, is expected to slow down significantly due to fundamental limitations.  In response, new materials are sought that can continue the historical rate of scaling.  Transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors are promising new channel materials because they are naturally thin.  Thinning of the channel is one of the most important recent developments in the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor devices that help to achieve better electrostatic control.  To that end, the dichalcogenide systems are expected to provide the thinnest semiconducting channel material, surpassing the limit that can be achieved in bulk semiconductors. In the proposed research, students and researchers will fabricate devices in the dichalcogenide systems.  The principal investigator will train both graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, particularly those underrepresented in science, to fabricate and characterize semiconductor devices.  These devices will be used as hands-on learning tools in the courses offered at the university.   Also, the principal investigator will work with at-risk urban youth from Albany, Troy, Schenectady, and Newburgh to educate them on the growing opportunities in the regional semiconductor industry.   The principal investigator will also work with staff to host two one-day summer workshops for secondary school teachers on classroom integration of nanoelectronics modules developed under the proposed middle school/high school outreach efforts. <br/><br/>New materials and device concepts are needed to continue the historical increase in functionality of computing devices.  In the proposed research, a reconfigurable device will be developed that can morph into the three most fundamental devices.  These devices are p-n diode, metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, and bipolar junction transistor.   Using these devices, the principal investigator will demonstrate basic logic functions with fewer transistors.  These research thrusts are possible in the recently discovered transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors because they are naturally thin, which is particularly suited for implementing the gating technique pioneered by the group.  Because a single device can accomplish all three device functions, the proposed research can uniquely provide fundamental linkages between material properties and device performance that would be difficult to attain had the devices were fabricated individually.  This research will use the state-of-the-art 300mm fabrication facility located at the university to fabricate highly scaled devices.  It will train students on the challenges of device integration and to the opportunities such an advanced fabrication facility provides. At the fundamental level, this research will provide a unique insight into how the three devices are intimately linked. These devices can achieve rectification, switching, and current amplification, respectively. This research will measure the key figure-of-merit of each device and provide linkages to material properties, including the interface trap states. With reduced dimensions, many-body effects become important. Although many-body effects are not needed to understand the properties of modern transistors,  their role will become significant as transistors continue to shrink.  The proposed research will help to inform the semiconductor manufacturers to the importance of many-body effects by measuring the excitonic properties and the band gap, which can renormalize when the semiconductor is doped.  The results of this research will be disseminated to the growing number of semiconductor companies that are co-located at the university."

Unlike most mature technologies, however, the innovation witnessed in the field outstripped our understanding of basic these materials properties. In addition, the hybrid perovskites contain lead, which represent an environmental hazard, precluding their incorporation in future applications. This project is a collaborative effort between a research group at Wake Forest University with expertise in device fabrication and electrical characterization and a group at University of Utah with knowledge on materials growth, optical and magnetic field effect measurements. The research will focus on the investigation of the electronic processes that limit the operation and stability of hybrid perovskite-based devices; designing and implementing device structures that promote improved performance; and developing lead-free hybrid perovskites. Driven by the anticipated high impact of hybrid perovskite electronics on the US economy and society, this interdisciplinary research program will integrate education by implementing a strong teaching and mentoring component that complements all stages of the research efforts. <br/>Technical:<br/>The research will focus on novel hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HTP) single crystals and thin-film growth, structural, optical and electrical characterization, device design, fabrication, and characterization with the following objectives: (i) develop Pb-free hybrid perovskites; (ii) understand the mechanism of charge transport in hybrid perovskite materials; (iii) elucidate the coexistence between the electronic and ionic transport and their contribution to HTP device hysteresis, performance, reliability and stability. The project is structured into three phases. The first phase focuses on the study of charge transport in HTPs using time of flight, space-charge-limited current and FET measurements at various temperatures. In the second phase we will focus on the analysis of bulk and surface defect states by performing Poole-Frenkel and density of states analysis. In the third phase the PIs will disentangle the ionic and electronic contributions to the conductivity in HTP devices using Seebeck effect in the dark and under illumination, and impedance spectroscopy. The PIs and their research groups will continue and expand their efforts dedicated to enhancing the growth of the new field of perovskite electronics by organizing conferences, participating in activities at local science museums, and offering research opportunities to students from local community colleges and high schools."

Changes in synaptic strength at specific synapses are thought to underlie memory encoding and storage, yet there is very little experimental evidence for this theory in the intact brain due to technical limitations of visualizing the specific synaptic pattern involved in experience-dependent learning. This project aims to overcome this limitation by transforming a simple, inexpensive cannula into a super-resolution fluorescence microscope. Commercialization of this technology will be pursued after the fundamental science and engineering has been demonstrated for widespread dissemination. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of this proposal is to image neuronal activity, neuron structure and protein localization deep in the brain with sub-100nm resolution using computational cannula microscopy (CM) and novel molecular reporters of synaptic activity. CM will allow imaging of the brain in awake, freely moving animals at unprecedented spatial resolution. Current techniques in freely moving animals are limited to imaging the brain near the surface, include large and heavy head stages with moving parts, and cannot penetrate deep into the brain without significant damage to surrounding tissue. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to allow imaging of individual synapses in freely moving animals. We have already developed the framework for in vitro fluorescence imaging using CM. During this project, we will extend CM to enable: (1) super-resolution (< 100nm resolution) fluorescence microscopy and (2) deep-brain imaging (depth > 1mm) with the vision of imaging activity and protein localization in individual synapses in the deep brain of freely moving animals. Changes in the strength of individual synapses are thought to underlie learning and memory in the brain, yet this fundamental theory of brain function lacks tangible experimental evidence to support it in vivo. Our project will enable studies that address the causal role of molecular events at individual synapses in mediating behavior and information processing."

So far, several methods for microswimmers have been developed including magnetic actuation, harness of bacteria, use of biological chemical/biological fuels, etc. However, these methods have many drawbacks including high bulkiness, high cost and incompatibility with human body. In addition, all the above methods were never or rarely integrated with feedback control or tracing systems to maneuver the microswimmer in a three-dimensional space. This National Robotics Initiative (NRI) award supports fundamental research on manufacturing three-dimensionally maneuverable, biodegradable, untethered, micro swimming drones, studying/developing feedback control algorithms to control their three-dimensional trajectory, and evaluating them in biological environments. The proposed micro drone is propelled by acoustically excited micro bubbles such that its driving system can be integrated with the current clinical ultrasound system with minimal amendment. The proposed drone has tremendous impact with societal benefits on various potential medical applications: local treatments of tumors, removal of fatty deposits on blood vessel walls, break or removal of blood clots, kidney stones, liver stones, gouts, burn cleaning and wound debriding, attack and removal of parasites, removal and break of tar in lungs, drug delivery and controlled release, etc. This research project will also have significant impact on education by (i) re-engineering coursework for both undergraduates and graduates in inter/multi-disciplinary areas; (ii) having graduates and undergraduates involved in research especially from the underrepresented groups; and (iii) demonstrating results from this project in K-12 schools and in public websites and hosting a robotics workshop for underrepresented high school students.

The fabrication and assembly technique of 3-D structures can be readily applied to many fields whose applications otherwise remain on 2-D structures. Novel beamforming technologies developed for US actuating/imaging of micro object can be adapted for high quality ultrasound imaging for broader, general applications. Advances in understanding and new findings of nonlinear (bubble) cavity oscillation and associated fluid dynamics will help develop the best imaging strategy for microbubbles inside microvasculature structures. In addition, the Lyapunov stability-based nonlinear control design method with a state estimator can be applied to control other robots (and other nonlinear systems with zero dynamics) where only partial information is available.

That feat will be replicated by this project through the development of both artificial neurons and synapses on the same materials platform.  This will allow us to create systems that can emulate the capacity and speed of the human brain for pattern matching, beating current systems that are bulkier, slower and more power hungry. This will revolutionize the field of machine learning and create devices where the machine-learning hardware is close to the sensor, giving rise to systems that are currently impossible to create. Neuromorphic circuits based on these devices include smart wearables that can monitor health biometrics and issue first level triage for elderly people alone at home. They can improve autonomous driving for terrestrial vehicles. These circuits will be especially useful for spacecrafts and space rovers because these ultra-light circuits will not be a bottleneck to the rocket's payload. Fast pattern recognition abilities through these deep neural networks will enhance speech recognition in portable electronics and improve traffic analysis and control systems. In collaboration with Central Florida STEM Alliance (CFSA) program, underrepresented minorities from local community colleges will be provided hands-on research opportunities in the lab of the PI. Regular video lab tours to underrepresented K-12 students and week-long lab experience for two selected K-12 students annually will foster their interest in STEM education.

Volatile resistive switching observed in vertically-standing sheets of MoS2 will be harnessed to realize integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons, and the stochastic nature of their firing will be investigated. Artificial synapses with sub-picojoules of energy requirement per switching event will be developed using the multi-level non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets. The mechanisms behind this intriguing phenomenon of volatile resistive switching in vertical MoS2 sheets versus non-volatile switching in horizontal MoS2 sheets will be investigated using electrical and materials characterization techniques. The necessity of graphene electrodes in the heterostructure will be justified. Through engineering of the heterostructure design, the performance of the artificial neurons and synapses will be optimized to create stochastic resistive-switching IF neurons and low-power synapses which will be integrated monolithically. The advantage of mechanical flexibility of graphene and MoS2 will be exploited to fabricate and test these neuromorphic devices on a flexible platform. The proposed research program aims at bringing together two emerging research areas cohesively into a cutting edge technology. While 2D materials have immense prospects in succeeding silicon within the von Neumann paradigm, non-von Neumann approaches have always dealt with conventional materials. This transformative research would bring together the best of both these worlds. The use of large-area 2D materials will enhance the practical realization of these exotic devices.

Despite the tremendous market growth and price reduction demonstrated by PV technologies over the last two decades, PV-generated electricity remains below 1% of our total electricity usage; further cost reduction could be achieved through higher device performance leading to accelerated deployment of PV. The project will investigate several processing routes to improve the output voltage of the CdTe cell, which is the remaining challenge to achieving near ideal performance.  This research seek to minimize the negative impact of grain boundaries and other structural defects, in order to improve key material properties which control the output voltage of CdTe cells.  The focus will be on studying elemental impurities, specifically phosphorous (P) doping, and its interaction with grain boundaries and other 2D structural defects in CdTe films and their alloys. Graduate students at both institutions will gain experience in thin film device fabrication, crystal growth, and advanced methods of characterization of materials and devices. This project will also impact students from K-12 and provide educational resources on thin film solar cells and materials on PV education. The PIs and associate graduate students will continue hands-on solar cell teaching outreach to middle and high school students. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The main goal of this project is to create the fundamental knowledge and process techniques required to advance the output voltage of CdTe PV. This research has the following objectives:  (1) investigate the effect of isolated grain boundaries in large mm grain size materials, and use the findings to tailor the properties of polycrystalline thin films; (2) investigate the combined effect of group V dopant(s) with post-deposition processing techniques on the net p-type doping; (3) enhance p-type doping by suppressing structural defects through alloying CdTe(Se,S); (4) lower interface recombination at critical device interfaces, such as the main junction and back contact, through alloying. The above goals will be pursued through a holistic approach that will include the investigation of large mm grain size bulk materials, device quality polycrystalline thin films, and state-of-the-art device structures. The experimental component of the project will be rooted in fundamental material studies and expanded to device engineering.

As the deployment of new communication, computation, and control technologies in modern power systems increases, more sophisticated tools will be required to analyze and prevent failure and attack propagations between and within system layers. The objective of this project is to harden CPESs against failures and attacks and to educate future engineers about the new types of threats to future power systems and required tools to strengthen them. The proposed research encompasses the following key areas: classification of system layers and characterization of their interactions; establishment of new reliability and resilience indices; and development of advanced comprehensive models and methods for reliability and resilience assessment and enhancement of CPESs.

First, the problem of reliability and resilience assurance in power grids is timely since cyber-attacks and network reconnaissance missions have been increasing in recent years. Second, given that power grids are critical to the nation's economy and security and that the consequences of blackouts and damaged grid equipment are severe, it is becoming imperative to harden them against attacks and failure propagation. In addition to these large-scale contributions, the proposed research promises a direct and substantial educational impact, most notably by developing new curriculum, incorporating several project aspects into power reliability and resilient control courses, enhancing graduate and undergraduate research programs, and creating new student mentorship and career opportunities.

Although, amorphous materials have found applications and continue to show promise for modern technologies, charge carrier and phonon transport in these materials remain a point of dispute. The lack of long- and short-range order in amorphous materials leads to complicated interplay between structure and energy transport. In this project a novel class of electronic materials based on bulk amorphous structures in the form of amorphous-crystalline nanocomposites will be developed and their thermal and electrical properties will be tailored. The application will be focused on thermoelectric materials, but the results are expected to produce new science applicable to other functional materials including optical and magnetic materials. Parallel to the research endeavors, an educational plan will be implemented which incorporates and develops a new teaching initiative in the upper-division undergraduate curriculum, involves undergraduates in research, promotes student international collaborative research, exposes the field of energy materials to the general public, and provides a resource web-site for advanced thermoelectric material studies. The available resources in the Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP) and Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) programs will be used for expanding the participation of minority students and the recruitment of high school students.<br/><br/>This research plan addresses the essential need for a physical description of charge and phonon transport in amorphous based materials, characterization of their structural dependencies, and application of this understanding to enhance the thermoelectric performance of amorphous and the more complex structure of amorphous-crystalline nanocomposite materials. The focus will be especially in the regime where the carriers energy remains at non-equilibrium state due to the consecutive passage through material domains with different equilibrium energy distribution of carriers. The multi-mode transport of charge carriers in extended and localized states in disordered multi component amorphous-crystalline nanocomposite structures will be addressed. This is a new scientific problem with many unresolved scientific questions. Further understanding of charge carrier and phonon transport in such amorphous based materials will directly impact their material design and offer novel material structures for electronic applications. Parallel to theoretical studies, an efficient and scalable top-down approach for synthesizing such structures will be developed. The material is processed in a single transversal mode microwave cavity that provides an extraordinary route to create a new state of amorphous materials in a rather quick and convenient way. The decrystallization process happens by merely subjecting the solid material to a strong E or H field in the cavity. The method results in in-situ formation of such structures, which is not possible by conventional bulk processing methods. This unique capability opens a new landscape for engineering non-equilibrium structures."

These advancements will provide the building blocks needed to implement reconfigurable and high-performance sensing and communication systems that will provide much larger bandwidths than current microwave and millimeter-wave systems. This is an important technological area with a wide range of applications that will generate significant benefit to the society. High-performance variable THz modulators and attenuators based on rectangular waveguide configuration can be applied to radio astronomy, scientific instrumentation, and metrology. Tunable THz filters using programmable electromagnetic bandgap structures will enable spectroscopic sensing and imaging for enhancing defense and security screening (e.g., substance identification and detection), chemical and biological sensing, and disease or cancer diagnostics. More advanced reconfigurable THz circuits generated using photo-induced substrate-integrated waveguides will find applications in adaptive ultra-high-speed wireless communications. By using the proposed techniques, virtual circuit patterns that can be dynamically reconfigured will be implemented without complex circuit fabrication and device integration processes, leading to tunable and reconfigurable THz circuits that could not be realized using conventional approaches. The project also provides significant educational opportunities for students.  The graduate students in this program will be exposed to the full scope of semiconductor physics, electromagnetic wave propagation, microwave engineering, advanced THz system design and testing process, from single device to the circuit/component/system level.

To further improve and develop new electronic switches that can be manufactured more cheaply and consume less power, new device concepts based on novel two-dimensional materials rather than conventional silicon technologies have been proposed and new research is needed to assess their potential properties. An important step in the development of such new electronic switches is computer simulations incorporating the physical elements that control the charge transport. Many important breakthroughs have been realized in electronic transport simulations and quantum transport is routinely simulated using a host of tools available to the community. However, all of these currently available tools start from the chemist's ""tight-binding"" viewpoint rather than from the physicist's ""plane-wave"" vantage point. Unfortunately, certain physical processes that are important in two-dimensional materials are difficult to be treated correctly using the tight-binding basis. The goal of this project is to transform the way quantum transport is studied by moving from the tight-binding basis to the plane-wave basis. This project will develop a plane-wave based quantum transport code capable of studying novel electronic devices. The project will also include a study of conventionally-scaled electronic devices as well as newly proposed devices and materials that present important routes toward the realization of a more energy-efficient electronics. This project will also generate a pipeline of students motivated to study science and engineering at universities through participation in various outreach programs at the University of Texas at Dallas. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will develop a plane-wave based code capable of studying quantum transport in nanoscale devices such as nanowires and nanoribbons. Efficient plane-wave algorithms to reduce computational memory and time requirements and a robust capability of studying the effects of spin-orbit coupling will be implemented in the code. Electronic dissipative scattering in these nanoscale devices will be dealt with using the Pauli Master equation. Important physical phenomena that will be incorporated are: scattering with phonons, defects, and edge roughness. Of particular interest is scattering with the flexural out-of-plane phonons which are hard to describe in a localized basis set. The atomic-scale dielectric response in these low-dimensional systems will also be studied. Using the developed quantum transport code, a wide variety of devices, such as conventional field-effect transistors, tunneling-based field-effect transistors, and topological-insulator field-effect transistors, will be studied. The research will elucidate the impact of flexural out-of-plane phonon modes on the electronic-transport characteristics of low-dimensional materials. The effects of spin-orbit coupling on transport will be determined. How the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and the electron-phonon interaction affects transport will be clarified. Finally, the research will also unravel the important physical processes in future field-effect transistors and determine how to deal with possible detrimental effects such as line-edge roughness."

Rose (PI) and C. Patrick Collier (co-PI)<br/>University of Tennessee, Knoxville<br/><br/>Proposal Objectives:<br/>Using biologically-inspired approach that better mimics the architecture and signaling currency of biological neural networks and to offer untapped potential for new forms of multifunctional neuromorphic behaviors.<br/><br/>Nontechnical Abstract:<br/><br/>Neuromorphic computing as a field comprises computational hardware engineered to mimic the behavior of the mammalian brain. Such systems are well suited to perform applications that are often simple for a biological brain but prove to be difficult for classical artificial computers for example, recognizing human faces at most any angle. While many neuromorphic architectures have been studied over the years, implementations based purely on traditional silicon-based circuitry fail to mimic the basic properties of biological neural networks, and, possibly as a result, they require far more power to achieve similar computational capability. To address this limitation and to uncover new insights into the role of properties such as tunable ion transport and synapse-neuron organization on complex computation in the brain, this project considers a new class of adaptable brain-inspired circuits comprised of biomimetic membranes with reconfigurable transport properties that mimic the variable weighting found in real synapses and solid-state artificial neurons that communicate via these synapses.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/><br/>This project delineates significantly from prior electronic neuromorphic hardware and digital software systems. Specifically, in this work the PI investigates: 1) how molecular transport through biomimetic membranes can be gated using physical stimuli to reproducibly vary synaptic weights in artificial synaptic mimics; 2) learn how to integrate membrane-based synaptic mimics with solid-state (i.e. transistor based) neural circuitry to develop hybrid devices that exhibit controllable and reproducible plasticity; and 3) utilize network modeling techniques to predict how variable synapse weighting within multi-neuron architectures affect collective sensing and learning functionality. This high-risk, high-reward project features a comprehensive integration plan across research and educational activities such that the results from previous work inform many, including neuroscientists studying complexity in the brain, engineers developing neuromorphic computation devices and brain-hardware interfaces, and social scientists in understanding how continuously-variable signaling pathways aid in learning, individuality, and group behavior. The broader impacts of the proposed work are transformative in nature and of interest to multiple fields of science, engineering, and medicine. By tapping into environmentally friendly, easily configurable soft materials and emulating nature's design, the PI seeks to advance computational strategies past Exascale, thus setting the stage for the next generation of low-power autonomic computation, distributed sensing, and information storage. Our approach also contributes to advancing brain-inspired computing systems, energy-efficient circuitry, and synthetic devices capable of communicating with live tissues, including multifunctional medical implants, drug-delivery devices, systems for disease monitoring and treatment, and technologies that can assist the brain in learning and cognition. The modeling and simulation aspects will also generate new open-source software that will allow students and researchers to explore the characteristics of network arrangement and synapse plasticity on network functionality. The educational impact leverages the fact that this project interfaces topics in engineering, biology, physics, and chemistry; PhD students involved in this work will receive exclusive scientific training to prepare them for making contributions in multiple fields. These activities also support broader impacts by generating interest in STEM, increasing participation of underrepresented groups, and expanding engineering curricula."

The confined light becomes much more sensitive to environmental changes, exerts an amplified mechanical force, and can generate significant nonlinear effects even at small light intensities. For this reason, optical microresonators are being actively studied in the context of optical cooling or amplification of mechanical motion, for precision metrology, lasing, ultrasensitive biosensing and other areas. Confinement of light is usually achieved using solid materials, but this project proposes to achieve it using liquid microstructures. The transition to liquid droplet creates significant challenges, but also opens up new opportunities. Firstly, mechanical softness of droplets makes them more receptive than solid materials to the light-induced forces resulting in many orders of magnitude larger mechanical responses and hence increased efficiency of optical cooling or heating. Secondly, liquid droplets allow access to the resonator's interior regions. Because electromagnetic field is orders of magnitude larger inside than outside of the resonator, one can expect the corresponding increase in sensitivity of biosensors based on droplet resonators by several orders of magnitude. Thirdly, use of liquid droplets allows realizing a novel class of photonic molecules with extra strong optical bonds based on droplet-in-droplet structures, in which one or more smaller droplets are encapsulated in a larger droplet. Overall, the objective of this project is to demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid droplet resonators in the fields of optical cooling, lasing, sensing and metrology. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, which includes physicists, and electrical and mechanical engineers, will ensure that graduate and undergraduate students will be exposed to the culture and methodology of different disciplines. In addition, the project will build connections between American and Israeli researchers and students and strengthen the collaboration between American universities participating in the project and Technion, Israel's premiere engineering school. The support for this project is provided within the collaborative NSF-BSF (Binational US-IL Science Foundation) program with participation of the Israel team financed by BSF.<br/><br/>This project merges the fields of microfluidics and optical whispering-gallery- mode resonators by proposing the study of the optical and optomechanical properties of novel photonic structures composed of fluid droplets. The mechanical softness of liquid droplets combined with their versatility and tunability will allow the principal investigators to study novel optical and optomechanical effects such as optical cooling of capillary waves, topological energy transfer in the vicinity of exceptional points, and others. The international multidisciplinary team formed for this project will exploit state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies to fabricate different structures of droplets, with each droplet serving as a high-quality photonic resonator. Numerical simulation and theoretical models will be developed to understand the physics associated with the novel structures developed in the project. Experimentalists working on the project will carry out optical characterization of the proposed structures and develop in-depth understanding of their novel optical and optomechanical effects. This research will advance the field of optofluidics by applying state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies to the fabrication of novel microfluidic devices and generation of complex structures of microdroplets. Study of novel photonic structures with unique properties will also open new directions in the field of optical whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The general field of computational electrodynamics will also benefit from this work by taking the T-matrix formalism well outside its nominal domain and applying it to the modes of optically coupled complex structures of liquid droplets."

This project seeks to develop a silicon-carbide based optically-activated gate-turn-off thyristor (SiC OA-GTO) that is expected to be a game changer in RFI, with clear device and system level benefits based on radically new innovations. The SiC OA-GTO will also have clear benefits for several major applications including pulsed-power systems, transfer switches, high-voltage power electronic converters for medium-voltage drives, energy storage, step-up-transformerless integration of solar and wind energy, and flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), to name a few. This National Science Foundation (NSF) project will provide graduate- and undergraduate-level research and education opportunities, including a significant representation of minority and cross-disciplinary students. Guidance will be provided to one middle-school student each summer. The results of the research will be integrated into the course ECE 442 (Power semiconductor devices and integrated circuits). The PI will leverage his demonstrated mechanisms of research dissemination (for his ongoing and prior NSF projects) to support this NSF project.<br/><br/>The technical objectives of this project are as follows: 1) To synthesize a high-gain monolithic SiC based optically-activated (OA) gate-turn-off thyristor (i.e., SiC OA-GTO) for realization of a Rapid Fault Isolation Device (RFID) (i.e., SiC OA-RFID).  The SiC OA-RFID is expected to support high breakdown voltage, high rated and surge currents, high slew rate, low on-state forward drop, high junction temperature, and operation using low average optical triggering power; 2) To design an optimal photonic package for the SiC OA-GTO and then using it realize a SiC OA-RFID to address reduced parasitic inductance given the presence of large di/dt, thermal robustness, and uniform and efficient triggering and mitigation of current filamentation by optimal beam localization; and 3) Experimental I-V and switching characterizations of the fabricated prototype device at package levels for performance validations. The SiC OA-GTO device for the OA-RFID incorporates several key features: a) a monolithic SiC device structure that mitigates parasitic inductances yielding high di/dt; b) rapid turn-on and turn-off due to novel optical excitation and unity-gain turn off; c) very low optical power requirement due to thyristor action and conductivity modulation; d) low forward drop; e) seamless voltage and current scaling; f) high-voltage blocking and current conduction; g) high thermal conductivity; h) novel optical triggering that simplifies switching; and i) no dependence on oxide layer. The new optical single-bias device, unlike leading high voltage Si and SiC based devices yields immunity against noise, enhanced reliability, and reduced delay due to direct photogeneration. Additionally, optical triggering eliminates complexity associated with negative gate referencing. The optical device enhances isolation between the SiC OA-GTO power stage and the low-voltage control stage. Photonic modulation of the device enables dynamic control of device dynamics of the SiC OA-GTO yielding reduced delay and improved on-state and off-state characteristics."

However, the silicon-based semiconductor technology cannot handle the power levels and switching frequencies anticipated by the next generation of power applications. This EAGER project aims to create the prototype of high power diamond based transistors with properties that are beyond the scope of current devices in terms of operating frequency, power handling capacity, operating voltage, and operating environment. Such diamond based semiconductor devices can eliminate the majority of the power losses that currently occur during AC-to-DC and DC-to-AC electricial conversion, operate at voltages up to 30 times higher than silicon-based devices, and operate at temperatures above 300C, twice what silicon electronics can tolerate.  These devices may revolutionize power distribution and conditioning, allowing for a more versatile and stable power grid with efficient access to non-traditional power sources, to improved efficiencies for electric motor drives, and to improved microwave and millimeter wave sources. Many of these devices will be appropriate for operation in harsh chemical, biological, thermal, or radiological environments. This research will provide a proof of principle for diamond-based high voltage devices and high frequency devices and will also enable the accurate design of diamond based FETs, which will exploit advantages of increased temperature and voltage insensitivity of 2D structures. As a result, the research will lay the foundation for the development of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor diamond technologies, which will both outperform current Si, SiC and GaN high voltage device characteristics and will have much higher voltage and temperature tolerance. <br/><br/>Technical: The present NSF EAGER research project is to demonstrate a new transistor concept based on two dimensional hole gas (2DHG) channels in diamond thereby extending the basic science of diamond 2D transport channels to high-voltage devices as well as high frequency power devices. This objective will be achieved through correlations between experimental results with device design as well as with basic models of charge transport. Our proposed research will investigate the fundamental device physics of diamond based field effect transistors (FETs) for high power and high voltage applications.  These diamond based FETs will exploit multiple sub surface nanometer thick boron -doped channels which have been fabricated via the precision control of chemical vapor deposition chemistry. The proposed plan is to achieve unique and innovative device structures through the fabrication of two dimensional conduction channels on single crystal (100) diamond epitaxial layers grown on diamond substrates.  The research is based on the fundamental understanding of the delta doping and carrier channel formation in diamond 2D channel devices, and will employ the unique facilities available at the University of Maryland.  The research approach consists of the design and fabrication of double delta doped FETs based on an optimized channel dopant profile, as well as utilization of insulating gate materials complex dielectrics for surface passivation. Device electrical performance will be characterized after fabrication. Investigations on -doped channel FETs will also consist of in depth device modeling and electrical and physical characterization of performance."

Most of these applications requires a sufficient THz light power density so that the light can pass through materials and able to be detected for analysis. This has fueled intense studies on the generation of high power THz light in the past decades. The recent demonstrated THz source based on nonlinear generation inside a mid-IR quantum cascade laser (QCL) is proved to be the only room temperature semiconductor light source that delivers mW-level power at room temperature in the 1-5 THz range. The main challenge for this type of sources is to generate higher THz power up to tens of milliwatts with good beam quality which is required by most of the real-world application. A novel approach is proposed to develop a chip-based THz source with high power output by extracting THz light from the entire cavity. This simple to use and compact source will be an enabling technology which will allow easy access to THz spectroscopy/ imaging for the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate a room temperature, monolithic THz source with sub-milliwatt level output power in continuous wave operation and tens of milliwatt level in pulsed mode operation. In the previous demonstrations, edge-emitting THz sources based on nonlinear generation inside a mid-IR QCL have limited outcoupling efficiency (~6-10%) due to the limited outcoupling aperture size regarding to the entire cavity. The approach in this proposed project is to use a surface-emission scheme based on THz diffraction grating defined in the semi-insulating InP substrate of a epi-down bonded THz QCL source for high-power and efficient THz outcoupling. Unlike the traditional distributed-feedback (DFB) grating which interacts with the guiding laser modes by providing the optical feedback, the proposed THz diffraction grating simply diffract the incident Cerenkov emission cone into the discrete directions. With an optimized grating structure, surface emission from the entire cavity with diffraction efficiency up to 90% is achievable. This will drastically increase the THz outcoupling efficiency and power. In contrast to a THz sources based gas lasers, which is bulky and expensive, the proposed THz QCL source offers a monolithic solution that, once developed, has potential for cost-effective mass production using the existing semiconductor laser fabrication infrastructure. This project is an excellent example of a multidisciplinary approach used to circumvent existing technological limitations. Solid state physics, material science, nonlinear optics, and laser physics are all major components of the research plan, which are all supported generally by NSF, and are used, in this case, together to combine multiple functional elements into a single, compact, high power device."

The five familiar senses are sight, taste, hearing, smell, and touch. Our senses create joy and pleasure, but also pain and sorrow. In some cases they warn us from imminent danger, in other cases they do not or only when it is already too late. This project focuses on liquid crystal-nanoparticle sensors for the qualitative and quantitative detection of toxic gases and vapors. These integrative sensors systems can display an unmistakable warning in the form of text or an image in the presence of toxic gases and vapors without any electrical power, and provide parts-per-million level sensitivity. The active component of these sensors is based on reactive, ink-jet printed nanoparticle alignment layers for nematic liquid crystals. In analogy to omnipresent liquid crystal displays, an image (or readable pattern) emerges due to the presence of specific hazardous toxic gases and vapors that could affect the lives and health of firefighters, military personnel in conflict zones, first responders, and workers in chemical manufacturing among others. Sensors for volatile compounds exhaled by humans can also be used to monitor disease states and disease progression such as in diabetes, liver disease, or cancer.<br/><br/>The focus of the proposed activities is to advance recent findings that nanoparticles and particularly their surface functionalization induce and alter the orientation of nematic liquid crystal molecules in direct contact with them. By applying this concept, gold nanoparticles in the size regime between 1 and 10 nm with reactive surface ligands are synthesized and patterned via ink-jet printing to devise sensors for multiple hazardous (chlorine, phosgene, cyanide, amines, dialkyl chalcogenides) or less hazardous gases and vapors (ketones). The combination of nanoparticle ink-jet printing and established concepts of optical and electro-optical responses of nematic liquid crystals in contact with nanoparticles and other surfaces enables the creation of highly sensitive and selective sensors, where the sensing event produces a direct visual readout or warning without the use of electrical power. The proposed research in collaboration with an industrial partner offers new prospects for sensing harmful environments and monitoring disease progression, both quantitative and qualitative, wearable and remote, and with multiple detection modes. In conjunction with simulations, measurements of light transmission and birefringence in the presence and absence of applied electric fields provide unparalleled datasets for the development of liquid crystal sensors for the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative detection of multiple toxic and non-toxic gases and vapors.

The proposed work will take advantage of unique, recently uncovered wake-structure interactions that can increase power output and efficiency in densely packed arrays of oscillators. The approach of using oscillating hydrofoil devices that can be closely arranged together will open new markets for hydropower in locations previously considered too shallow or cluttered to be feasible. With many population centers located on coastlines and along rivers, this new source of clean energy would have minimal transmission costs and losses. Such devices could also be invaluable in off-grid sites like remote villages or temporary shelters for people displaced by disasters. Smaller scale applications could create flow-powered sensing stations that do not rely on short-term and environmentally hazardous consumable batteries for applications like monitoring critical infrastructure. At the utility grid scale, when compared to other renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, oscillating turbine hydrokinetic power arrays will offer more convenient integration into the power grid due to the predictable nature of the energy source. While wind and solar power are subject to daily variation and intermittency due to weather changes, tidal flows in particular can be accurately predicted well in advance, allowing the various sources in the utility grid to be readily balanced to cost-effectively meet demand and production allocations. In addition, the proposed education activities will serve to help broaden participation in engineering and inspire children to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) studies. North Carolina middle school and junior high school students will learn about flow energy harvesting and engineering design in a hands-on lab activity the researchers will develop and run as part of the popular NC State University summer camp program.

The work proposed will leverage a different approach that exploits and optimizes interactions between devices at the mechanics level. Specifically, experimental and analytic studies will (1) investigate the parameters that govern the occurrence, strength, and scaling of the synergistic wake-structure coupling and how it can be used to enhance the performance of 2D arrays of hydropower energy harvesters.

Current intersubband devices rely on materials with relatively low conduction band offsets (<1 eV) and low longitudinal optical phonon energies (~30-40 meV) that, respectively, prevent intersubband devices from operating in the short-wavelength infrared and limit the operation of terahertz quantum cascade lasers to cryogenic temperatures. GaN/AlGaN heterostructures grown on c-plane substrates have been previously investigated to overcome the abovementioned problems. GaN-based materials system offers conduction band offsets over 2 eV and have optical phonon energies of ~90 meV. However, strain-dependent piezo-electric fields make it virtually impossible to produce desired intersubband bandstructure in practical devices grown on c-plane substrates. Additionally, relatively small heterostructure thickness, limited by strain, and poor optical field confinement in the heterostructure prevented efficient light-matter interaction in devices reported previously. The proposed AlInGaN heterostructures on m-plane GaN substrates are free from strain-induced fields making reliable intersubband bandstructure design possible. Strain-compensation will be used to overcome critical thickness constrains in materials growth. The heterostructures will be further processed into double-metal plasmonic cavities using photoelectrochemical etching for substrate removal to enable efficient light-matter integration. Two types of intersubband devices will be investigated: double-metal waveguide THz QCLs and intersubband nonlinear metasurfaces for operation in the telecommunication spectral range. The former devices represent a viable path towards developing the first room-temperature electrically pumped semiconductor lasers in the THz spectral range, while the latter devices offer a path for developing intersubband metasurfaces with a giant nonlinear response for short-wavelength infrared.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common prerequisite for these two quantum phenomena is strong spin-orbit coupling, either intrinsic or the Rashba type. Of the two phenomena, QAHE requires additional exchange interaction or ferromagnetism in graphene. Although native graphene has neither interaction, its open and flexible structure allows modifications of the properties by proximity coupling to other materials.  The proposed quantum phenomena based on quantized anomalous Hall effect can be potentially used for dense, robust, low-power, and scalable non-volatile memory which will drastically improve the performance of the current memory devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions. The non-volatile memory devices are ubiquitous in the modern society. High-performance memory devices based on quantum spintronic phenomena will have a significant impact on low power memory. PI proposes to train the undergraduate and graduate students, especially the underrepresented minority students by engaging them with research projects and teaching them newly developed elective courses. The also PI plans to continue outreach activities to a STEM school by coaching the Science Olympiad events  to STEM High school students as well as giving lectures to the summer Physics teachers from southern California high schools during Physics Teacher Summer Academy sponsored by the Physics Department. <br/><br/>PI's group has successfully demonstrated the anomalous Hall effect in graphene via the proximity coupling with a magnetic insulator.  More recently, PI's group also demonstrated a strong enhancement of spin-orbit coupling via the proximity effect with a transition metal dichalcogenide material (e.g. WS2). In this work, the PI aims to explore the induced effects in all-proximity coupled graphene devices, which acquire new interactions for realizing the predicted quantum effects at relatively high temperatures. Currently few materials are predicted and even fewer materials have been experimentally shown to exhibit QSHE (e.g. HgTe/CdTe quantum wells) and QAHE (e.g. magnetic topological insulators).  These materials are extremely difficult to be synthesized or only show the desired properties at extremely low temperatures. The proposed graphene-based devices are ideal systems in which the required interactions can be induced by proximity effects. Those quantum phenomena have not yet been explored in graphene, but it I expected to show many novel and interesting properties, such as quantized transport, robust Hall voltages, pure spin current, etc. These unmatched properties, if demonstrated at high temperatures, can potentially revolutionize the present-day spin electronics. In this proposed research, the PI plans to demonstrate a prototype quantum spintronic memory device based on QAHE.  The knowledge learned in the graphene-based devices will deepen our fundamental understanding of two-dimensional electron systems with tunable interactions."

There is a need to develop extremely compact sources, and to develop sources that are agile, meaning their frequency can be shifted on the shortest possible timescale.   A good candidate is nanoscale magnetic oscillators that produce highly tunable microwave frequencies through the application of d.c. current.  Singly, these magnetic oscillators have insufficient output power and too broad a linewidth to be applied in technology, however, if they can be connected to each other so that they synchronize their microwave output, both the power and the linewidth problem can be overcome.  While a few magnetic oscillators have been coupled together previously, it has been difficult to design them so that they synchronize in a scalable way.  Additionally, understanding the nanoscale magnetic interactions between oscillators is an interesting scientific problem that has implications beyond technology.  This project will train both undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, and it will offer research experience for science teachers.<br/><br/>In this proposal, the research team introduces three innovate concepts to overcome the challenge of scalably synchronizing nanoscale magnetic oscillators.  First, they propose to design, model and fabricate lateral magnetic oscillators driven by the spin Hall effect in a periodic array using concepts from the emerging field of magnonics.  Second, they will employ spatiotemporal magnetic microscopy to experimentally examine the dynamical modes of these structures, which will help reveal how individual STOs are coupled to its neighbors in real devices.  This is a new opportunity offered by recent breakthroughs in lateral spin Hall oscillator devices because magnetic oscillator networks were previously based on direct injection, vertical transport devices.  In those devices, the magnetic layers are buried and very difficult to image. The availability of imaging creates an opportunity to engineer devices based on specific, device-level insight. The third innovate concept is to use stroboscopic imaging to study loss mechanisms from magnetic modes.  Traditionally, stroboscopic methods are blind to incoherent processes, like the coupling between spin wave modes that can lead to dynamically enhanced magnetic damping. By combining microwave driving fields that are both commensurate and incommensurate with the stroboscope, the research team will examine how energy can be transferred between useful magnetic modes and spurious magnetic modes.  The insights from this research will enable new and better designs to synchronize magnetic oscillators."

The mcOLEDs will be fabricated combinatorially on a single substrate, providing narrow emission bands (full width half max FWHM~20 nm). The emission peaks, produced by different active materials and microcavity dimensions, will range from the red to the near UV. The uniform dense array of such mcOLEDs, yet unachieved, will be integrated with two types of highly responsive perovskite PDs (an approach not yet explored): those responsive over a broad spectral range and those responsive over a narrow range. Bio/chem analytes will be monitored in two modes of operation, measuring analyte-induced changes in the (i) PL intensity using narrow-band PDs and (ii) PL decay time using both PD types. Developing both approaches will enhance selectivity and specificity. Importantly, to enable the advantageous PL monitoring where viable, the mcOLEDs and PDs will be evaluated and optimized to shorten the pulsed electroluminescence (EL) decay time and the PDs response time by fundamental studies of their relation to materials, charge mobility, layer structures and thickness, defects, and device design.

It is critical to be able to characterize such complex nanoscale configurations. A unique tool for characterization of nanoscale materials and devices is X-ray imaging, which can provide structural images with a high spatial and time resolution. In a typical X-ray imaging setup an X-ray source generates an X-ray beam that is scattered from the structure.  The scattered X-ray beam is captured by a camera, and the resulting picture is processed to reconstruct the actual structure configuration. Due to their short wavelength X-rays can penetrate the structure's volume thus enabling not only two-dimensional but also three-dimensional imaging. X-ray imaging typically requires a significant computational effort for image reconstruction and often the computational time is longer than the time for performing the experiment. This project aims at closing this gap by creating high-performance computational tools for real-time X-ray imaging. The created software is to serve a broad community of synchrotron scientists. The developments in nanoscale imaging are intended to have applications in areas ranging from condensed matter physics to biology and chemistry of single molecules. A close interdisciplinary research effort between a computational researcher and an expert in X-ray scattering and material physics will benefit graduate students and postdocs working in these fields, and is likely to result in new and unexpected discoveries.  <br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to create a high-performance computational framework for real-time X-ray imaging to be performed at X-ray scattering facilities.

The proposed research includes algorithm and code implementation, practical application, and educational components. A set of algorithms for phase retrieval X-ray imaging are to be introduced, including methods for image representation and use of relevant constraints, methods for computing transformations between real to reciprocal spaces, and implementations on massively parallel computing systems. The research effort also introduces a virtual synchrotron framework utilizing computational methods to simulate experimental image reconstruction and provide required constraints, with magnetic nanostructures as a testbed. The developed computational framework is to be applied to real-time study of nanostructured materials and devices, such as nanoscale magnetic devices. The program integrates research and education by enhancing undergraduate and graduate courses on computational physics, micromagnetics and electromagnetics as well as providing graduate and undergraduate student training and contributing to diversity."

The combination of standard optical gain and parametric interaction in a single laser cavity not only opens route to high output power operation but also gives rise to new dynamics never studied before. The project will address a number of key issues that currently prevent this laser platform from becoming suitable for nonlinear microscopy application. The specific goals of this proposal are: 1) Develop compact and robust ultrafast fiber lasers that can replace expensive and bulky Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser;  2) Generate ultrafast laser wavelengths not currently available commercially (in fiber format) such as 1300 nm and 1700 nm which are important for deep tissue multiphoton imaging; 3) Characterize and test the developed laser sources on real applications including cancer and brain imaging. This project will provide the first systematic study of ultrafast fiber optical parametric oscillators both experimentally and theoretically. The research will enable new high power fiber lasers working at important wavelength gaps that current state-of-the-art fiber laser technology cannot provide. Recently, fiber lasers based on traditional gain media operating in normal dispersion regime with self-similar pulse-shaping have been introduced. This has enabled fiber lasers to achieve high energy, high power, and low noise performance surpassing that of other solid-state lasers based on crystals and free-space optics. We have shown that fiber optical parametric oscillators can be designed to work in self-similar regime. The self-similar evolution opens new routes to create compact and robust optical parametric oscillators with very broad wavelength tuning and high output power level suitable for nonlinear optical microscopy and a range of other applications such as 3D writing, pump/probe spectroscopy, frequency comb metrology."

Clinical translation of these polymers requires controlled and sustained drug release with dose profiles tailored to specific needs. The lack of a robust method to study the release profiles in physiologically relevant microenvironment hinders the development of effective drug-laden polymer coatings and their clinical utilization. This project aims to design, fabricate and demonstrate a facile and innovative all-optical lab-on-fiber platform mimicking physiologically relevant microenvironment for real-time study of therapeutic release from antibiotic drug- and growth factor-containing polymer coatings.  The lab-on-fiber platform, consisting in essence of a fiber-optic grating sensor coated with therapeutic polymer enclosed in a glass capillary, holds excellent promise to be a robust and broadly adoptable testbed to meet the critical need in the development and evaluation of therapeutic-eluting polymer coatings. This project will also provide a fertile training ground for students at doctoral, undergraduate, as well as high-school levels with significant opportunities to interact with collaborators at MIT and the Academy of Sciences of The Czech Republic in Prague. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract: This project aims to design, fabricate and demonstrate a facile and innovative all-optical lab-on-fiber optofluidic platform (LOFOP) mimicking physiologically relevant microenvironment for in-situ time-resolved study of the kinetics and mechanism of therapeutic release from antibiotic drug- and growth factor-laden polyelectrolyte coatings deposited by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. The project tackles a major challenge faced by the scientific community in the ability, or lack of, to measure the release profiles of therapeutic polymer coatings in situ under physiologically relevant conditions, especially pertaining to fluid flow and microenvironment in order for their translation as clinical solutions. The LOFOP has as its core a long-period fiber grating (LPG) structure sensitive to LbL events at sub-monolayer resolution. LPG coated with therapeutic-eluting LbL polyelectrolytes will be integrated with glass capillary to mimic physiologically relevant fluid flow in a microenvironment. The LOFOP approach represents a transformative advancement from the commonly used test tube method to a simple and yet powerful optofluidic technique for time-resolved and in-situ release measurements. The aims of the project will be achieved by (1) numerical simulation using full-vector mode solver to select cladding modes most sensitive to LbL processes and to guide LPG fabrication; (2) LbL deposition of antibiotic- and growth factor-eluting polymer coatings on LPG; and (3) in-situ release measurements of the antibiotic and growth factor with physiologically relevant fluid flow rate and spacing as parameters. The results will be fitted with established release models to ascertain the release mechanisms. Feasibility of the LOFOP for simultaneous evaluation of drug release and ensuing bacterial response will be explored by integrating LPG containing antibiotic-eluting coating with glass capillary, the inner wall of which is cultured with S. aureus biofilm. Successful outcome of the project is expected to significantly advance the frontier of both LOF optofluidics and LbL for biomedical applications and beyond."

In fact, the terahertz field has become one of the most exciting research frontiers in recent years, stimulating a great deal of interest even in the popular culture. The above potential benefits to society have fueled the need for more versatile and energy efficient technologies to control and manipulate terahertz waves, compared to what is currently available. Therefore, this research aims to develop a new terahertz technology based on what are known as artificial dielectrics. Artificial dielectrics are man-made media that mimic the properties of naturally occurring dielectric media, or even manifest properties that cannot generally occur in nature. For example, the well-known dielectric property, the refractive index, which usually has a value greater than unity, can have a value less than unity in an artificial dielectric. This new technology will be analogous to the emerging technology of metamaterials that is revolutionizing the field of optics. Metamaterials are also man-made media that can control the flow of light even in counter-intuitive ways. In fact, the proposed technology offers many of the same intriguing possibilities as that of metamaterials. A key advantage of the technology is the ability to engineer the refractive index continuously, thereby being able to realize inhomogeneous media. In contrast, continuous variation of the electromagnetic properties is more challenging to achieve in metamaterials. Therefore, if one considers the impact metamaterials has had on the field of optics, the proposed research is bound to have an enormous impact in advancing the field of terahertz-wave sciences. This proposal will also promote educational outreach in terms of training and educating graduate, undergraduate, and pre-college students. This artificial dielectric concept provides an intriguing engineering platform to introduce budding scientists to fundamental physical phenomena.<br/><br/><br/>The primary goal of this research program is to develop a new technology for the control and manipulation of terahertz waves utilizing artificial dielectrics. During the course of this project, several key terahertz-wave devices will be developed via this new technology. These artificial- dielectric devices will have far better performance than existing similar functional devices, and will enable capabilities that are currently not available in the terahertz-wave regime. The scope of the research can be divided into two main thrusts. In one thrust, devices will be developed utilizing the homogenous version of the artificial dielectric. These devices will include wave- plates and polarizing beam-splitters. In the other thrust, devices will be developed utilizing the inhomogeneous version of the artificial dielectric. These will include gradient-index (GRIN) devices, such as the Maxwell' fish-eye lens and the Luneburg lens. The experimental work will be carried out using time-domain terahertz systems that are capable of generating and detecting picosecond pulses comprising of a baseband terahertz spectrum. In these systems, the transmitter and receiver modules are fiber coupled to provide the necessary degrees of freedom since beam paths are not always in line-of-sight. Importantly, this artificial-dielectric technology will resolve the long-standing problem of realizing high-index gradients, which has hampered the practical use of powerful GRIN devices. This work will also shed more light into the predicted super-resolution (perfect imaging that is not limited by the wavelength) phenomenon associated with the Maxwell' fish-eye lens. These research developments will have an enormous impact on the terahertz field by providing many new components and capabilities for the control and manipulation of terahertz waves."

It involves solving a set of nonlinear power flow (algebraic) equations. A great challenge in power flow study is the problem of power flow divergence. This is a long standing problem. The integration of new power system devices and renewable energy aggravates the power flow divergence problem. Future power grids have to support a wide variety of power flow patterns due to renewable energies. The conventional options currently available to overcome power flow divergence are quite limited. In addition, the following issues need to be addressed when the power flow divergence occurs: <br/><br/> -Issue EN (existence): a power flow solution does exist, but the numerical method, such as the commonly used Newton method has failed to compute it from a given initial guess, or<br/> -Issue NE (non-existence): no power flow solution exists with the specified network topology and loading conditions. <br/><br/>Recently, a Holomorphic Embedding Power Flow (HEPF) method was proposed, awarded a U.S. patent, and declared to be smart and robust. Specifically, the following three major and yet important claims were made (i) it is deterministic and non-iterative, (ii) it consistently computes the correct power flow solution if its existence is ensured, (iii)  it unambiguously signals the nonexistence of a power flow solution if it cannot find the correct power flow solution. However, there is little theoretical basis and technical analysis to support the above three major claims. HEPF, if works as claimed, can resolve the long-standing power flow divergence problem. However, the current version of HEPF method has several limitations, deficiencies and seven unresolved issues and the above claims are unjustified. This proposal aims to establish a theoretical foundation for the HEPF method, examine the limitations of HEPF, study the scope of its applicability and extend the HEPF method to deal with large-scale power networks with renewable energy.<br/>The proposed work will cover a range of theoretical foundation development, solution methodology design and practical numerical implementation. A smart and robust power flow solver and its theoretical foundation will be developed and applied to large-scale power grids with renewables. Robust and efficient computation of the solutions of a set of nonlinear equations is an important task in many practical applications in engineering and sciences. Hence, the development of the proposed study has broad impacts on many practical applications such as computation of direct current (DC) operating points of very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits. This is one of the most important and yet difficult tasks in VLSI circuit simulators. Overcoming the difficulties of power flow divergence problems will have a far-reaching benefit since the problem is at the heart of several power system studies such as power transfer capability calculations, static security assessment, optimal power flow, dynamic security assessment, etc."

The bioimaging applications will be further advanced in this project. It is a continuation of the previous study in which rare-earths were combined with a unique nanocarbon material, so called single-wall nanotubes. Nanotubes by themselves has been already used in various miniaturized sensors, which are so extremely small that can be placed on a fabric thread. Most recently this group proposed using nanotubes enclosed in the DNA for studying live cells and has obtained promising results. It has been already demonstrated how nanomaterials could improve sensing capabilities of rare-earths. New project will extend this study and focus on nanotubes as tiny antennas to magnify the optical signals received by rare-earths. Due to small (nanometer) scale of these optical elements they can penetrate inside the cells and transmit the biologically relevant information from there, potentially improving our knowledge about how cells work as building blocks of organisms and helping medicine and health sciences in solving their current problems. This research is accompanied by a vigorous outreach program, aimed both on the local community and STEM students nationwide.<br/>Technical:<br/>This project focuses on developing and studying materials for bioimaging based on the rare-earth complexes with single-wall nanotubes and single strand DNA. Significance of this research is in developing a new biosensing material. Since single-wall nanotubes have diameters of only a few nanometers, they are comparable to many biological macromolecules such as enzymes, antibodies, DNA plasmids, etc. and may interact with intracellular environment. This makes them increasingly relevant for new opportunities in biomedical research and applications. Though at early stage, this project enlighten us about how the living organisms, at the cell level, may be influenced by new modern nanomaterials (nanotubes) upon ingestion. Using optical non-destructing characterization the fate of the nanotubes inside the cells has been already determined on the previous stage of the project. In the course of new project the team will work on intertwined theoretical and experimental tasks, including experimental optical characterization and theory of near-field electromagnetic modes in the hybrid materials of nanotubes-DNA-rare-earth-ions; exploring performance of these nanomaterials for bio-sensing applications in photonic-crystals and inside bio-mimetic hydrogels; studying the role of hotspots in nanotube materials and their influence on the photoluminescence of rare-earth ions and/or DNA; experimental studies of modulation of optical response of photonic crystals  incorporating biosensing materials inside its lattice; application of these nanomaterials inside micro-fluidics sensing system and to studying in vitro neural stem cell.

Using two-photon polymerization, the proposed 3D-DLW system can write arbitrarily-shaped, three-dimensional patterns into light-sensitive polymer films with a lateral resolution down to 150 nm. The tools, thus, complements optical and e-beam lithography tools available at Georgia Tech, which can only write two-dimensional patterns with feature sizes down to 1m and 10nm, respectively.

It is used to predict and optimize device performance. Conventional simulation software solves the Maxwell's equations, which govern the propagation of light. It is designed for classical devices, which means that it does not include quantum effects. In recent years, quantum effects have become increasingly important in miniaturized optical devices. For example, a quantum dot, an element that can absorb or emit a single photon, can be used as an extremely energy-efficient switch. Such devices cannot be modelled using existing electrodynamic simulation tools. The project will develop a new simulation tool to incorporate quantum effects into classical electrodynamic simulation. To achieve this goal, the project will research a new quantum scattering theory that can interface with the classical Maxwell's equations. The result of the project includes a general-purpose simulator that allows scientists and engineers to efficiently explore quantum effects for next-generation optoelectronic devices. Preliminary studies show that intriguing quantum effects in this new design space could be used in fast and secure communication, renewable energy sources, and medical imaging.

The project will develop a numerical tool for generic modelling of hybrid devices. It will first develop a non-perturbative quantum scattering theory to model the transport of Fock-state photons in three dimensional spaces. The theory explicitly includes the spatial degrees of freedom of photons, which makes it possible to be directly integrated into classical electrodynamic simulation.

The ability to manipulate single cells individually in a liquid environment with high precision will enable many fundamental biological studies on cell-to-cell and cell-to-environment interactions that could not be achieved before. Such discoveries will provide key insights into the effect of the environment on cellular structure, function, and signaling, and would have wide applications across multiple disciplines in life sciences, agriculture and medicine. Due to their small size and also soft nature, it is extremely difficult to handle single cells with a physical device, such as mechanical tweezers, without causing damage to the delicate subcellular structures. Alternatively, focused electrical fields, laser beams, and ultrasound waves can be utilized to generate microscale forces at the focal point, serving as virtual tweezers for single cell manipulation. Among them, the 'acoustic tweezers' are the most compatible with the cells due to cell's higher tolerance of sound pressure over electrical field and laser illumination. However, unlike the laser beams that can be easily focused and steered with a glass lens and a rotating mirror, agile focusing and steering of ultrasound waves requires complex and expensive transducer arrays and control electronics. This situation has prevented the wide use of 'acoustic tweezers' in single cell manipulation. The proposed work is to develop an acoustic phased array to enable acoustic steering and focusing of ultrasound beams for their applications in high-resolution acoustic manipulation of single cells.<br/><br/>Among all existing single cell manipulation techniques, the ultrasound phased array has the greatest potential due to its unique ability to achieve electronic beam forming (without physically scanning the transducer(s)). Using this unique beam forming technique to focus ultrasonic radiation at precise locations presents unprecedented manipulation capabilities compared with other methods. However, in current ultrasound phased array systems, multiple channels of ultrasound signals are first converted into electronic ones with an array of transducer elements. The phase shift is then accomplished in the electronic domain. As the operation frequency and the number of the channels increases, the phased array system becomes increasingly complex, bulky, power-consuming and costly. Therefore, current acoustic phased arrays are not suitable for on-chip microfluidic platforms for single cell manipulation. To address this issue, this research aims to develop a new micromachined ultrasound phased array. It will consist of an array of micromachined silicon acoustic delay lines with tunable delay lengths to create the desired phase shift for multiple ultrasound signals without the need for electronic conversion. This enables ultrasound beam forming with a single-element transducer and a single-channel ultrasound transceiver. With advanced micromachining processes, it can be readily fabricated and even integrated together with microfluidic components onto the same substrate for single-chip operation. To achieve the research objective, the following three research tasks will be accomplished: 1) Conduct acoustic and electromechanical design and optimization of the acoustic phase shifter; 2) Develop an on-chip microfabrication process to achieve multi-channel integration; and 3) Demonstrate dexterous acoustic manipulation and positioning of single cells using the ultrasound phased array. This multidisciplinary research is expected to provide unique learning and training opportunities for both graduate/undergraduate students. Students in grades 7-12 will be involved through Engineering Summer Camps and Open House activities. Research results will be incorporated into the PI's course development at all levels. They will also be disseminated through publications, outreach activities, invited talks, and a project website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike electrical circuits, these networks consist of biochemical species (genes, proteins, RNAs, etc.) that interact and regulate each other via chemical reactions. A holistic understanding of how biomolecular networks process information for cellular decision-making will have tremendous long-term impact on human health. For example, a systems-level deciphering of biomolecular networks will fundamentally transform our knowledge of aberrant regulation driving diseased states, and will lead to novel ways of finding biomarkers and drug targets that take the network dynamics into account. Moreover, designing and rewiring of networks using systems approaches will open doors for different applications, such as, production of biofuels and therapeutics. To facilitate these transformations, this project aims to build scalable mathematical tools for modeling, analysis, inference and control of biological networks.<br/><br/>Measurements inside individual cells reveal biological networks with rich stochastic dynamics, owing to the inherent probabilistic nature of biochemical processes.  The intellectual merit lies in modeling of biomolecular networks via a Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) framework. Combining tools from control theory, dynamical systems and random processes, the project will develop computationally tractable methods for analyzing deterministic and stochastic dynamics of complex biomolecular systems. These methods will improve computational efficiency of predicting network dynamics by orders of magnitude as compared to traditionally used Monte Carlo simulation techniques. Analysis tools will be used to explore designs of feedback and feedforward loops in biomolecular systems that allow for systematic manipulation of network activity, for example, controlling fluctuations in the level of a specific protein embedded in a larger network. Accurate methods for predicting stochastic dynamics also motivate an intriguing inference problem of learning about the underlying network architecture from measured joint fluctuations in the network components. Advances in single-cell technologies enable precise quantitative measurements of protein copy numbers inside individual cells over time. Motivated by increasing availability of such measurements, the project will build inference methods for improved characterization and reverse engineering of network interactions from time-series measurements of protein levels. In terms of broader impact, the project tools will be applied to study diverse biological pathways in close collaborations with experimental researchers in the life sciences. These include regulatory networks underlying several medically important systems, such as, cell-fate regulation in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and nongenetic drug resistance in cancer cells. Finally, courses applying systems and control concepts to biological networks will be developed for both students and professionals from local industry."

Built upon the innovations on sensors (micro-synchrophasors) and actuators (power electronic interfaces), we envision a future distribution grid to be comprised of many microgrid clusters, each interfacing through points of common coupling with little or no inertia. It is anticipated that the results of this project will help many communities (such as rural and developing regions) to leapfrog the century-old distribution grid through an envisioned clean slate approach to integrating a much deeper level of renewable resources at a much higher level of reliability. The project will provide a fresh perspective on inspiring students to engineer a qualitatively different electricity delivery system that is tailored for the paradigm shift in both sensing and control technologies. Housed at one of the largest university power/energy programs in the U.S., this team will introduce new course modules on the topic of the future distribution grid, which closely integrates power electronics and power systems background knowledge for more than 200 undergraduate and graduate students currently enrolled in power courses at Texas A&M. This team will continue a strong track record of engaging undergraduate students for research, in particular underrepresented groups. The prototype and simulation visualization will be presented at the annual ""Discover ECE"" event, which attracts more than 300 high school students and parents annually. <br/><br/>The scientific objective of this project is to investigate novel power electronic interfaces, as well as the control of microgrid clusters for ensuring dynamic security at the distribution grid level. The project will address the following questions: a) how should an all-DC or AC microgrid interact with distribution systems through an appropriately designed power electronics interface; and b) what would be a control architecture that leverages advances from power electronics and sensors, and achieves provable dynamical performance. This project puts forward a truly interdisciplinary research agenda to leverage power electronics and control for advancing the distribution grid sciences. The cross-fertilization of power systems and power electronics will provide fresh perspectives for the future distribution grid. The intellectual merit of this project is four fold. First, the research team will investigate the possibility of guaranteeing distribution system-level transient stability via distributed droop management. This difficult problem will draw upon the structure of the closed-loop microgrid module dynamics, which, in turn, lends the distribution grid transient model as a Lur'e system with time invariant sector bounded memoryless nonlinearities. Second, the project will introduce a multiple points of common coupling (PCC) control of a microgrid when it has multiple connections with distribution systems. This will allow for decomposing an MW-level inverter into multiple lower rating inverters with much lower cost and increase in reliability. Third, for the case of DC microgrids with MWs of capacity, a closed loop iterative process of adjusting the output voltage and phase angle for voltage source inverters with finite LC output filter impedance will be will introduced and tested. Fourth, for the case of AC microgrids, an optimal power electronic transformer topology (with fault tolerant features) will be developed to achieve the wide range of voltage magnitude and angle adjustments at fast response as required by the microgrid angle droop dynamic control approach enabled by modern micro-synchrophasors. Prior art methods for voltage/angle adjustment are both slow in response and limited in range, rendering them unsuitable for the proposed control architecture."

According to the National Academy of Sciences, 100 million patients in the U.S. alone can benefit from implantable tissues and systems.  However, current implantable technologies still face central challenges of biocompatibility and facile communication with external devices.  An improved method for building advanced biocompatible implantable devices could greatly advance the development of implantable sensors, drug-delivery devices, and drug-eluting stents and devices.  Hence, the research objective of this proposal is to establish the key elements of a fundamentally new platform for wireless control of implantable devices.  Specifically, the proposal seeks to develop a method for using focused ultrasound to actuate small components inside microdevices made of biocompatible materials.  Ultrasound is already widely used for diagnostic imaging, and our work will seek to leverage this imaging modality to actuate implanted devices.  In addition to research goals, this project contains elements that seek to address other potential benefits for society in education and diversity:<br/>- Undergraduate students: new research opportunities and lab modules on ""implantable devices"" for undergraduate students at both      <br/>  Columbia University and George Mason<br/>- High-school students: integration of implantable device research into educational modules for New York City high-school students<br/>- Technology transfer: nurturing of undergraduate students interested in commercializing state-of-the-art microdevice research into real-  world devices for society<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>In terms of specific research goals, this proposal aims to construct and demonstrate a new paradigm to efficiency control biocompatible microdevices using ultrasound.  Ultrasound is fundamentally attractive because it is non-invasive, can penetrate through millimeters or even centimeters of dense tissue, and uses hardware which can be made compact.  In our design, ultrasound can actuate selective microcomponents in the devices by precise focusing of ultrasonic energy or by employing agents that selectively respond to pre-specified acoustic parameters.  Importantly, ultrasound can impart energy into implants which themselves contain no embedded biotoxic electronics or power supply, unlike most printed electronics.  Despite these attractive qualities, to our knowledge, ultrasound has not been previously used to control implantable microdevices, let alone ones made from biocompatible materials that avoid biofouling. This research proposal is innovative in a number of specific aspects.<br/>- Fabrication of microdevices with components responsive to ultrasound<br/>- Developing and understanding how acoustic parameters interface with microdevice components in deep tissue<br/>- Developing a method to selectively actuate components inside a microdevice"

A number of recent studies have shown that the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in blood stream is good predictor of the heart disease risk. However, current methods to detect these rare circulating cells are only suitable for well-equipped research laboratories. There remains an unmet medical need for development of point-of-care biomedical technologies allowing rapid and reliable quantification of endothelial progenitor cells directly from patient's blood. This research program proposes to develop novel microfluidic technologies based on phononic (acoustic) metamaterials (artificial materials) for high- efficiency size-based enrichment, affinity-base isolation and label-free counting of endothelial progenitor cells from blood samples. To achieve these goals, the proposed research program aims to make a remarkable leap in understanding and use of acoustic forces created on piezoelectric substrates. Similar to electronics, it aims to introduce a complete set of acoustic-microfluidic components that can be combined to provide full laboratory functions on a chip platform. In addition to providing training opportunities for graduate students, the educational component of this program incorporates unrepresented minorities from undergraduate programs such as Multicultural Engineering Program and offers mentored summer research experiences (internships) to local high school students. Furthermore, the proposed program aims to contribute in outreach activities through programs such as Girls in Engineering Program, a program focused on middle school girls and to provide senior design project opportunities to final year undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>This research program aims to introduce novel acousto-microfluidic devices with new functionalities using on phononic bandgap structures. It focuses particularly on ionic-type phononic metamaterials offering a monolithic integration capability to piezoelectric substrates. This opens door to planar and scalable integration of phononic bandgap structures with microfluidics and acoustic wave sources. Merging phononic bandstructure engineering and microfluidics at a fundamental level could lead to modular lab-on-chip technologies that can be programmed to do different tasks in a compact and highly efficient way. The specific goals of this program are (1) to advance of our understanding of two-dimensional phononic metamaterials to guide, trap and focus acoustic phonons, (2) to merge these two-dimensional phononic metamaterials with microfluidics, and (3) to demonstrate practical uses of these novel acousto- microfluidic devices for sorting, isolation and counting of endothelial progenitor cells for detection of hearth diseases. The proposed research program involves theoretical analysis of monolithic phononic metamaterials, acoustic radiation forces and dynamic behavior of micro- bioparticles in acousto-microfluidic channels. The designed phononic metamaterial devices will be fabricated using in-house fabrication facilities and the powerful fabrication techniques recently developed in Yanik lab. Acousto-microfluidic experiments will be conducted to test, refine and advance theoretical models of these metamaterials and understanding of acoustic radiation forces in solution environment. Yanik lab will also demonstrate practical uses of phononic bandgap devices for size/affinity-based sorting, manipulation and isolation of micro- bioparticles in microfluidic channels for biomedical applications. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the fundamental knowledge of ways to manipulate surface acoustic waves by phononic metamaterials to optimize their use in microfluidic systems. Understanding advantages and technical issues associated with employing phononic metamaterials will lead to a deeper insight into their unprecedented potential for more involved schemes of acoustofluidic particle manipulation. This will be accomplished by interdisciplinary research combining our expertise from physics, electrical engineering and biological sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This experimental approach has a potential to carry out task deep inside the human body in a very fast manner compared to existing technology. The objective of the research is to explore the precise underlying physics and chemistry that controls the effectiveness of this proposed drug delivery methodology and push its limits to be able to engineer a practical medical device. How much of this ultrasound can be generated and how the magnetic particles need to be placed for effective drug delivery will be addressed in this work. The proposed work will provide unique training opportunity to undergraduate and graduate research assistants in theoretical and experimental tools of multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics, and medical sciences. <br/><br/>The key objective of the proposed research is to assess the drug delivery capability of a new improved magneto-liposome structure that aims at addressing the shortcomings of previous magneto liposome designs. In this new magnetic liposome structure, gold coated iron oxide nanoparticles will be used as a source of ultrasound for triggering drug delivery in the liposomes. The gold surface of the magnetic particles facilitates a strong attachment of chemical linker via thiol functional groups. The magnetic structures that produce local ultrasonic vibrations are attached to the liposomes via thiolated polyethylene glycol derivatives of cholesterol and phospholipids. As a secondary objective of the proposed research, the PI aims at exploring a potentially more efficient ultrasound generation process from non-spherical magnetic nanorods in rotating magnetic fields. The proposal describes a pulsed magnet capable of mechanically turning colloidal nanostructures. A course-grained molecular dynamics simulation will be developed to provide physical insight into the mechanism of ultrasound generation in colloidal magnetic solutions. It has been found recently that colloidal magnetic nanostructures are able to produce sufficiently large amount of ultrasound that can induce drug release in magneto liposomes from high frequency magnetic fields. The key hypothesis is that once the magnetic particles are moved outside the liposomes structures, one can trigger more efficient drug release, and can carry larger drug delivery capacity from the same sized magneto liposomes when compared to previous designs. It is anticipated that the drug molecules from the liposomes can be released in a very short time (sub millisecond timescale) without significant temperature rise, which will create a new platform for practical delivery of short lived temperature sensitive drug molecules. The proposed work also addresses ultrasound generation in different ways compared to the previous discoveries. It is hypothesized that ultrasound may be generated from anisotropic magnetic nanostructures (nanorods) more effectively in rotating magnetic fields than from spherical magnetic particles in inhomogeneous non-rotating magnetic fields."

These molecules and hazardous agents have unique absorption spectra in the terahertz frequencies, enabling identification of concealed hazardous substances from remote distances. Heterodyne spectrometers are at the frontier for high spectral resolution terahertz spectrometry. Achieved through a number of different techniques such as nonlinear frequency mixing in Schottky diodes, superconductor-insulator-superconductor structures, or hot electron bolometers, they have linewidth-to-center frequency ratios down to one part in a million. These state-of-the-art heterodyne spectrometers and mixers, however, are bulky (weighing tens of kilograms), are bounded by electronic noise far from the fundamental noise limits, and often require cryogenic cooling to reach appreciable sensitivities. This project proposes a chip-scale terahertz spectrometer based on modular integration of a chip-scale laser frequency comb with a chip-scale photomixer. The laser frequency comb consists of discrete optical frequency lines, widely tunable over an octave. The photomixer is based on a plasmonically-enhanced absorbing substrate, directly coupled to a terahertz antenna to collect the incident terahertz radiation. The proposed single-chip terahertz receiver has spectrometry bandwidth of 1-8 THz with spectral resolution better than a kHz, and operates close to the thermodynamical noise limits. The high-performance, low-cost, and compact terahertz spectrometer brings valuable applications in space sciences, biological analysis, environmental studies, pharmaceuticals, and industrial quality control. The proposed scientific efforts are coupled with an outreach and education plan. This involves outreach to underrepresented high-school students and teachers, improvements to the graduate and undergraduate curriculum, and outreach to the general public with focus on underrepresented women and minority students in summer research experiences for undergraduates. <br/><br/>The proposed advancement on the heterodyne chip-scale spectrometer consists of three cross-related Thrusts. In Thrust 1, the project will demonstrate an on-chip frequency comb oscillator with wide tuning range of 1-8 THz and comb line-to-line non-uniformity at 0.2 parts per quadrillion when referenced to the optical carrier. In Thrust 2, the project will develop an on-chip integrated pump laser and amplifier, for heterogeneous integration with the photomixer and frequency comb. In Thrust 3, the project will demonstrate the integrated chip-scale heterodyne receiver based on an antenna-coupled plasmonic photomixer. The team seeks to measure a heterodyne photomixer with double-sideband noise sensitivities close to the fundamental bound. The frequency-agile approach is enabled by their recent preliminary studies and measurements close to or at the thermodynamical noise limits. The proposed terahertz spectrometry architecture and scientific Thrusts can transform the platform of terahertz waves for atmospheric studies, space explorations, and safety-industrial-environmental quality control systems. The scientific Thrusts are integrated with educational outreach and cross-disciplinary training efforts. This three-year project will educate a new generation of scientists at the interface of precision chip-scale frequency combs and plasmonic photomixers for transformative terahertz spectrometry near the fundamental bounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to manipulate single cells individually in a liquid environment with high precision will enable many fundamental biological studies on cell-to-cell and cell-to-environment interactions that could not be achieved before. Such discoveries will provide key insights into the effect of the environment on cellular structure, function, and signaling, and would have wide applications across multiple disciplines in life sciences, agriculture and medicine. Due to their small size and also soft nature, it is extremely difficult to handle single cells with a physical device, such as mechanical tweezers, without causing damage to the delicate subcellular structures. Alternatively, focused electrical fields, laser beams, and ultrasound waves can be utilized to generate microscale forces at the focal point, serving as virtual tweezers for single cell manipulation. Among them, the 'acoustic tweezers' are the most compatible with the cells due to cell's higher tolerance of sound pressure over electrical field and laser illumination. However, unlike the laser beams that can be easily focused and steered with a glass lens and a rotating mirror, agile focusing and steering of ultrasound waves requires complex and expensive transducer arrays and control electronics. This situation has prevented the wide use of 'acoustic tweezers' in single cell manipulation. The proposed work is to develop an acoustic phased array to enable acoustic steering and focusing of ultrasound beams for their applications in high-resolution acoustic manipulation of single cells.<br/><br/>Among all existing single cell manipulation techniques, the ultrasound phased array has the greatest potential due to its unique ability to achieve electronic beam forming (without physically scanning the transducer(s)). Using this unique beam forming technique to focus ultrasonic radiation at precise locations presents unprecedented manipulation capabilities compared with other methods. However, in current ultrasound phased array systems, multiple channels of ultrasound signals are first converted into electronic ones with an array of transducer elements. The phase shift is then accomplished in the electronic domain. As the operation frequency and the number of the channels increases, the phased array system becomes increasingly complex, bulky, power-consuming and costly. Therefore, current acoustic phased arrays are not suitable for on-chip microfluidic platforms for single cell manipulation. To address this issue, this research aims to develop a new micromachined ultrasound phased array. It will consist of an array of micromachined silicon acoustic delay lines with tunable delay lengths to create the desired phase shift for multiple ultrasound signals without the need for electronic conversion. This enables ultrasound beam forming with a single-element transducer and a single-channel ultrasound transceiver. With advanced micromachining processes, it can be readily fabricated and even integrated together with microfluidic components onto the same substrate for single-chip operation. To achieve the research objective, the following three research tasks will be accomplished: 1) Conduct acoustic and electromechanical design and optimization of the acoustic phase shifter; 2) Develop an on-chip microfabrication process to achieve multi-channel integration; and 3) Demonstrate dexterous acoustic manipulation and positioning of single cells using the ultrasound phased array. This multidisciplinary research is expected to provide unique learning and training opportunities for both graduate/undergraduate students. Students in grades 7-12 will be involved through Engineering Summer Camps and Open House activities. Research results will be incorporated into the PI's course development at all levels. They will also be disseminated through publications, outreach activities, invited talks, and a project website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

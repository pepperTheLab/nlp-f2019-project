To realize the benefits to the nation of these advances in nanotechnology, however, advances must also be made in nanomanufacturing, and these advances must translate, in turn, into production by industry.  This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will investigate the knowledge diffusion and societal impact of nanomanufacturing research, using advanced data analytics frameworks. The study results are expected to inform government, industry, and researchers in identifying research gaps and how resources and investments could be directed to address obstacles to scaling the most promising nanotechnology discovery to industrial production. The project is highly exploratory and hence suitable for the EAGER program. The research results will be broadly distributed. The project responds to the NSF Big Idea--Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This project develops new analytical models and frameworks to study and analyze the outputs of research in nanomanufacturing. Nanotechnology studies are mostly high-level industry-wide reviews based on smaller-scale survey and are mostly available to members. This project is data science-driven, based on existing large databases and state-of-the-art data analytics including journal articles, patents, licenses and technology transfer datasets and made publicly available. The project develops a framework that systematically collects relevant data generated in the past 15-20 years from university technology transfer offices, public news databases, patents and publications, and analyzes the influence of research investments and specific projects on knowledge diffusion and its commercial impact. From the data, the project develops a novel, scalable text mining, topic modeling, trend analysis, and network analysis to quantify, evaluate, and visualize each research effort's long-term knowledge diffusion. The expected outcomes are to understand, (1) nanomanufacturing knowledge diffusion path from academic publications to patents to commercialization, (2) impact of federal investment in nanomanufacturing research in facilitating long-term knowledge diffusion, and (3) the difference between large-scale collaborative projects and small-scale individual projects facilitating long-term knowledge diffusion. The broad set of analytical techniques developed from this research are expected to further advance the scientific use of these methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to accomplish this objective, the researchers will determine the barriers to the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) and evaluate solutions to overcome these obstacles, and, in doing so, advance the fundamental science and ultimate applicability of LCA in the A/E/C (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) communities. The proposed research will have a significant impact on greening buildings within the US due to the synergistic nature of the team, which includes partnerships with major green building organizations, and addressing the needs of green buildings with the development of the proposed LCA method.  A task-based approach will be pursued. First, barriers and possible solutions to LCA will be identified through surveys and focus groups with partners, members, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and Pittsburgh's Green Building Alliance (GBA), as well as leveraging information from active case studies. A multifaceted, dynamic life cycle-based method for high-performance buildings, based on the identified barriers and possible solutions will be developed. A scenario building graphic interface ""the BUILD dashboard"" will be developed.  A specific simulation case study, cogeneration, will be used to illustrate the depth of the framework. A culture of evidence will be created in order to demonstrate how the application of the newly developed dynamic LCA will be successful in overcoming the various barriers.<br/><br/>The team plans extensive education, outreach, and reporting. The partner case studies will provide real-time data to the dynamic LCA and exemplify multiple levels and perspectives of the breadth and depth required for buildings: Phipps Living Building, a net-zero energy building currently under design (representing a high-level, complete building LCA); the Mascaro Center for Sustainable Innovation, a green building (representing a new existing building); and Carnegie Mellon University's Intelligent Workspace, an established structure (representing a building with existing sensor system and robust data). Cogeneration systems are also a focus of this proposal and the developed models will cross the building types (representing process and material choices and building system LCA). The PIs' plan for education and outreach includes: incorporation of research into the undergraduate and graduate courses; integration in an existing NSF REU site; capitalizing on Co-PI Landis' RET site to incorporate undergraduates and area high school teachers into the proposed research.<br/><br/>The FY 2010 EFRI-SEED Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer & Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."

Non-reciprocal components, such as circulators and isolators, enable new wireless communication paradigms such as full-duplex wireless that are otherwise not feasible and promise to significantly enhance wireless data capacity. However, non-reciprocal components today are almost exclusively realized through the magneto-optic Faraday effect, requiring the use of ferrite materials that are expensive, bulky and incompatible with the silicon-based integrated circuit technologies that power the wireless and computing revolutions. This proposal will devise, analyze and experimentally demonstrate new multi-physics approaches based on spatio-temporal modulation that enable the breaking of reciprocity at radio frequencies (RF), and the realization of compact and low-cost RF non-reciprocal components integrated in commercial silicon-based technologies. Broadly, this research will have a direct and critical impact on the societal need for enhanced access to wireless data by expanding the range of accessible RF spectrum, enabling new schemes for more efficiently sharing existing spectrum, and reducing the size and cost of nonreciprocal components, making wireless devices accessible to a larger portion of the population. In terms of outreach, this project will also provide opportunities for the education and engagement of students across the educational continuum from kindergarten through graduate school (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), leveraging existing programs at Columbia and Cornell, in collaboration with the Liberty Science Center in NYC and a number of coordinated outreach and diversity programs.<br/><br/>Recent research has revealed that introducing time variance into a material or system enables the breaking of reciprocity. While there are no fundamental performance limits associated with time-varying non-reciprocal systems and components, existing spatio-temporal modulation approaches for the realization of non-reciprocal components such as circulators have been fraught with challenges in insertion loss, size or linearity. While traditional spatio-temporal modulation approaches have relied on the variation of permittivity in dielectric media, the key insight in this proposal is the fact that semiconductor systems offer another material property that can be more powerfully modulated ? namely conductivity. Based on this insight, this project will pursue various multi-physics approaches to achieve non-magnetic RF non- reciprocity in silicon-based integrated circuit technologies. Blending electronics with acoustics and optics in an integrated setting, this project will demonstrate high-performance non-reciprocal circulators and isolators at RF, millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies. This project will also investigate synthetic RF media supporting topologically protected non-reciprocal modes of propagation from both a theoretical (i.e. mathematical) and experimental perspective, with applications in non-reciprocal antenna interfaces for emerging wireless communication paradigms such as large-scaled phased arrays and massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems."

Built from deceptively simple four bases (A, T, C and G), DNA is packaged by association with proteins into chromatin, which helps to condense the DNA into the nucleus and to regulate the DNA output. Previous work has established the importance of several factors, including chromatin compaction, the identity and modifications of the chromatin-associated proteins, as contributors to DNA output. However, we still lack understanding of the mechanisms that will allow us to effectively design DNA and chromatin architectures towards new functions. This project will take on the challenges of discovery and synthesis to meet this need by engaging teams of scientists bridging engineering and biology. For the graduate students who participate in this project, Yale's Integrated Graduate Program in Physical and Engineering Biology will serve as a framework for training a new generation of powerful practitioners of interdisciplinary science. This project will also recruit undergraduates studying biology, engineering and physics from under-represented groups to this interdisciplinary team to participate in well-defined, yet independent, projects. Engaging these students in mentoring and leadership roles for outreach programs at the high school and middle school levels will enhance their growth and confidence as scientists, engineers and scholars, while also bringing the fundamental concepts of bio-inspired design to the broader community.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this project are to define the design principles that underlie chromatin organization and to leverage the genome as a device to measure and record dynamic chromatin states. Historically, a major barrier to the quantitative and comprehensive understanding of chromatin organization is the lack of versatile, tractable systems in which to probe and interpret chromatin dynamics. This project leverages methods to combine high-resolution observations of the dynamic behavior of specific chromatin loci in individual living cells with a systems-level image and data analysis pipeline that sorts single-particle-tracking data from a population of cells into discrete diffusive states. Powerful genetic tools will be employed, in combination with modular engineering strategies, to alter key factors that influence chromatin structure, including the SMC protein complexes, cohesin and condensin, to create changes in the local epigenetic landscape. Simulations will be employed to test emerging models for the origin of topologically-associating domains, such as loop extrusion; these models will be further enhanced by accounting for both the dynamics and excluded volume of the chromatin polymer in three dimensions as well as the processes that drive loop formation. These insights will be leveraged to develop an entirely novel method to record transient chromatin conformations as ""memories"" in the genome itself through recombinase-based state machine designs, extending biological computing to the dynamic sampling of a cell biological state.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate, by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and by the Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation Program in the Division of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities in the Engineering Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The framework is based on mindfulness training, i.e. instruction in meditation and other contemplative practices. The underlying hypothesis is two-fold: 1) mindfulness training will cultivate creativity, innovation, intellectual risk-taking, altruism, and overall well-being, and 2) these characteristics will enhance trainees' ability to conceive of and pursue novel research ideas that address societal challenges. Importantly, because engineering and computer science graduate students frequently transition to research careers in academia, industry and national laboratories where they will become the next generation of innovators in their field, enhancing their creative capacity will benefit society through the innovations they produce both in the short term and over the course of their careers. Mindfulness training also has the potential to benefit the participants' overall health and emotional well-being.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The College of Engineering and the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin (UW)-Madison are partnering with the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Contemplative Sciences Center at the University of Virginia (UVa) to pursue an expansion of a recently conducted, NSF-funded, pilot study of a new mindfulness-training learning framework for engineering graduate students. The framework is intended to cultivate creativity, innovation, intellectual risk-taking, and altruism -- all of which are at the heart of conceiving and conducting transformative engineering research that focuses on societal grand challenges. The rationale for introducing graduate students to contemplative practices is two-fold. First, recent studies suggest that mindfulness meditation improves insight problem solving, reduces cognitive rigidity, and positively impacts creativity outcomes, as well as increasing empathy and compassion. These links are further supported by underlying theories about the neuroscientific mechanisms of mindfulness. Additionally, mindfulness meditation has been shown to have numerous health benefits, both emotional and physical, including reduced stress, and thus has the potential to holistically increase one's capacity for creativity and societally-focused innovation. The specific objective of this renewal project is to refine the ""Cultivating Transformative Research Through Mindfulness"" training program based on data from the pilot study, investigate its impact with a larger cohort of graduate students at UW-Madison, and assess transferability of the learning framework to UVa. The project is expected to yield extensive evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness training as an inherently scalable and adaptable learning framework for training engineering and computer science graduate students, enhancing their ability and interest to conduct innovative societally-focused transformative research."

But because infrastructure systems generally are viewed  as independent from each other, we often fail to recognize the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the interactions and interrelations between systems. This balkanization is compounded by cities' histories of centralized infrastructure creation and control that has led to fewer, but bigger, disconnected systems that have proven to be susceptible to failure, and may be unsustainable moving forward. The central hypothesis of this project is that interconnected and decentralized infrastructure systems are more resilient than isolated and centralized infrastructure by increasing response diversity. A secondary hypothesis is that decentralized infrastructure systems are more scalable and adaptable to change. The means to assess these hypotheses, however, are not readily available. While metrics and models exist to evaluate the subsystems, there is no way to consider their performance and function working together as a whole and in the context of social, behavioral, and economic decision making (SBEDM). This project will create that capability and then use it to develop the necessary comprehensive understanding of the resilience of centralized versus decentralized water, energy, and transportation (WET) systems at the metropolitan city and community level using Atlanta, GA as a test bed. <br/> <br/>There are 4 main research elements in this project. First, it will develop a systems dynamics model for the WET infrastructure, and the model will be used to assess how the system responds and adapts to exogenous and endogenous stressors for two alternate urban growth scenarios. The systems dynamics model will integrate the challenges and impacts of technology implementation with SBEDM. Second, a model will be developed to quantify the resilience of the WET infrastructures. The model will adopt an ecological engineering conceptualization of resilience and engage a demographically representative cohort of stakeholders in the process. The resilience of the proposed WET infrastructure will then be benchmarked to the expected range of climate change stressors, and compared to different measures of resilience as defined by theories of complex engineered and ecological systems. Third, a set of tools will be developed to simulate decision-making in the SBEDM environment. An agent-based simulation tool will capture the level of service impacts within the stakeholders, and a Bayesian network model will examine infrastructure investment decision-making. This tool will interact with the systems dynamics model to inform the stakeholders about the system performance under stressors and convey the decision back to the systems model providing directives for future development/ rehabilitation. The level of service impacts will be determined with the agent based model and the investment decisions will be conducted with a probabilistic approach. Lastly, a Pareto optimality model will be created of resilience and sustainability in WET infrastructure to assess the effect of climate change stressors like extreme heat events, droughts and floods on the water-energy-transportation nexus. This research represents a new system-of-systems approach to engineering the resilience of critical urban infrastructures in the context of their physical and socio-economic  environments. It will develop fundamental theories about interdependent infrastructure systems based on a complex systems engineering approach as well as from the study of ecological systems. The insights developed here will be useful in creating tools and methods for designing and evaluating the resilience of complex urban infrastructure systems, examining the value of engineering vs. ecological approaches, pioneering methods to bridge the gap between social decision making and urban design, and contributing to the creation of a national research agenda for integrating urban resilience and sustainability into urban planning by identifying necessary data and methodologies. Advanced course modules and curriculum materials (undergraduate and graduate) related to complex engineering systems will be developed, promoted, and widely distributed through the Center for Sustainable Engineering. Results and methods will be integrated into existing programs at Georgia Tech, including the Center for Education Integrating Science, Math, and Computing that specifically target scientific interactions with African American high school students. The team will engage stakeholders from the private and public sectors to: 1) develop model structures and secure data for model implementation and validation by industrial partners; 2) explore the full breadth of decision space thus making the analyses and models relevant to stakeholders; 3) increase model transparency and stimulate group learning through interactive model development including a participatory game; and 4) make science and engineering results more accessible (e.g., through visualization)."

Using communication bits encoded in quantum states of single photons, called qubits, this project will improve the bandwidth and reliability of quantum communication channels.  Advancing the art of quantum communication with photonic qubits is a frontier research topic because although these qubits provide security, the current technology for quantum communication has some limitations.  For example, the secure-key distribution rate (akin to the number of qubits per second) and the communication distance can both be improved. These operating parameters are currently around 1 Mb/s for distances around 50 km, hence their rate-distance product is many orders-of-magnitude lower than current classical fiber network communication rates and distances. The team seeks to address this problem via a transformative multi-pronged approach: (1) encoding more bits per photon by using the time-frequency degree-of-freedom; (2) developing a chip-scale photon qubit source for higher rates, higher stability, and easier deployment; (3) developing a chip-scale photon qubit storage and release module for longer distance nonclassical communications; and (4) fundamentally new protocols and architectures for orders-of-magnitude higher secure-key rates. This multi-pronged approach is supported by the team's recent leading advances in these areas, and matched with their pedagogical training and education outreach in chip-scale nonclassical optics. They have an emphasis on women and minority graduate students in their training. Their effort spans the fields of material science, nanofabrication and silicon photonics, quantum measurements, and quantum information theory. <br/><br/>Technical: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for secure information processing and communications, and photonic hyperentanglement or high-dimensional entanglement has been specifically cited in this regard for its high data capacity and error resilience. The continuous-variable nature of time¡Vfrequency entanglement makes it an ideal candidate for efficient high-dimensional coding with minimal limitations. By storing high-dimensional entanglement in quantum memories, the range of entanglement distribution can be extended for long distance quantum communications. While significant progress has been made towards sources of high-dimensional entanglement and long-term quantum memories, major challenges remain in matching the frequencies and bandwidths of these components, integrating them on-chip, room-temperature operation, and developing the theoretical framework for how they can be exploited efficiently. The intellectual significance is to address these challenges and demonstrate a scalable cross-cutting platform towards chip-enabled unbreakable communication networks. The project has three interrelated thematic Thrusts. In Thrust 1, the team methods and approaches will develop on-chip biphoton frequency comb sources and auxiliary devices for quantum communication such as integrated lithium niobate for biphoton production and single-photon frequency conversion, microresonator structures for comb creation, electrically-pumped module, and Franson and conjugate Franson interferometers for security checks. These devices are matched in frequency and bandwidth with the ones in Thrust 2, where the team will develop solid-state rare-earth quantum memories for storage of the high-dimensional biphoton frequency comb, and room-temperature operation via phononic bandgaps and laser refrigeration. In Thrust 3, the team will develop security analyses for new quantum key distribution protocols that exploit the full potential of chip-scale biphoton frequency combs, verified in a full link performance testbed. Thrust III also examines the memories in quantum repeater architectures for distributing entanglement in quantum networks, thus extending the range of high secret-key rate quantum communication. The proposed scientific advances are coupled directly to multidisciplinary education and pedagogical training of underrepresented scientists and engineers in nanoscale quantum information sciences. The PI's interdisciplinary training crosses boundaries in electrical engineering, materials science, information theory and physics, to advance the nanoscale chip-based frontiers of quantum communications."

Hence, an initial failure in the power network can trigger failures in the communication network, which can then trigger further failures in the power network, thus resulting in a cascading failure.   Existing models and analytical methods oversimplify the complex inter-relationships between power and communications networks, and hence are ineffective in dealing with cascading network stresses.  The goal of this project is to develop and validate a fundamentally new paradigm for capturing the complexity of interdependency between networks in a tractable yet accurate manner, and to utilize its predictive power to determine outcomes of network stresses and to provide prescriptive solutions to mitigate cascading failures by strengthening critical network elements.

The project aims at both graduate and undergraduate curriculum development activities at the participating institutions, particularly at bringing together students from economics and social sciences disciplines that may not otherwise be exposed to the energy and communications domain.   <br/><br/><br/>The project takes an important step towards the principled understanding of the interdependent power and communication networks, and the development of practical solutions that can be used to enhance their robustness.  The research is organized into three interdependent thrust areas:<br/>1) Macro-level Analysis and Design: This thrust area establishes the analytical foundations of an innovative methodology based on Boolean logic based implicative interdependency relations to characterize interdependency between different network entities in large scale power and communication networks spanning the entire country, and its impact on overall network resilience.  A key novelty of this approach is to distill complex interdependencies into analytically tractable logical relationships that can be used to make failure recovery decisions.<br/>2) Micro-level Analysis and Design: This thrust area delves deep into individual entities of the power and communication systems, such as system controllers and power generators, to understand how the health of each is affected by prevailing conditions. Constructing realistic graphs across different system entities and observing the cascade of events across the network through detailed simulations yield insights on the dependability of each constituent entity.<br/>3) Socio Economic Analysis: Given that the network/utility operators have different motivations, this thrust transforms technical insights into applicable policy decisions based on game theory and surveys/interviews conducted with the stakeholders for socio-economic analysis. Identifying value of the entities associated with each operator on overall system resilience, incentivizing them to harden crucial ones, and creation of an exchange to trade in resources form the key aspects of this part.<br/><br/>The direct impact of this project is on providing recommendations on the critical issue of how best to enhance the resilience of power and communication infrastructure.  The analytical methodology developed is also relevant to other heterogeneous interdependent networks.   The educational aspect of the project is based around creating synergies between ideas drawn from engineering and the social sciences and making these available to a broad-spectrum of students.  A special focus on providing learning opportunities to female and minority students is a further strength."

The need to enhance our knowledge of water resources and the ways in which society conveys, stores, distributes, and increases access to water in appropriate qualities and quantities for a range of purposes has become urgent. Particularly as population growth, land use changes, and the variability in climate have challenged the natural capacity of ground and surface water systems to replenish themselves, greater understanding of water resources in all parts of the hydrological cycle and of ways to develop new approaches to monitor, model, recycle, and treat water is crucial for societal and environmental health and security. This award is for partial core support for the Water Science and Technology Board which serves as the focal point for water issues at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. As part of this role the Board brings scientific and engineering attention through publications to respond to a range of water resource questions and is an immediate resource and point of reference for the government on behalf of the water science and engineering community.<br/><br/>The Board's objectives include advancing discovery, understanding, and application of the most current science and engineering approaches to a range of water issues; fostering cooperation and exchange among government, academia, industry, and other stakeholders on pressing topics in the water resources arena; and promoting teaching, training, and education in multi-disciplinary water-related research and technology. Through its consensus reports, convening functions, and other publications and communications, the Board, comprising subject-matter experts who serve pro bono, and the Academies staff work with the water science and engineering community to identify emerging topics relevant to the discipline and important to government, and provide a neutral forum to explore these topics on a continuing basis. As a complement to traditional forms of academic research, the Water Science and Technology Board examines emerging issues through a form of knowledge generation predicated on convening information and perspectives from a range of stakeholders. The Board?s activities are unique in their contribution to increasing knowledge in water science and engineering because they draw upon the Board?s convening capabilities, which rely upon dialogue, information exchange, and consensus building. Since 1982, the Board has fostered facilitated, focused science- and engineering-based discussions that provide valuable benefits to the water science community, the government, and public through objective examination and synthesis of pure and applied water research and its impacts. The ability to support dialogue and information exchange among different researchers and other stakeholders offers the opportunity to further advance knowledge in all areas of water science and engineering. The Board brings scientific and engineering attention to respond to a range of water resource questions and is an immediate resource and point of reference for the government on behalf of the water science and engineering community. The consistent capacity and rigor provided by the Board membership and staff enable the Board (and the Academies) to provide the broad water resources discipline with a singular interface with government and policymaking, and equally, for government with the water resources discipline. Working in strong collaboration with federal and state agencies, academia, industry, and nongovernmental organizations in the water resource arena, the Board can receive and respond to questions and issues raised by the full range of stakeholders in the water community. The Board works to isolate key topics that require input from the water science and engineering discipline and facilitates communication and cooperation among different stakeholders. Through these efforts and its use of various means of communication and outreach, the Board helps inform public policy and can engage different generations of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in constructive dialogue across the water science and policy domain."

These should be significant societal challenges that will require the expertise of environmental engineering and science to resolve or manage.  The report will shape the growth of university departments, inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists to address the most pressing global environmental challenges, and improve the training of environmental engineers and scientists to better meet these challenges. <br/><br/>The committee will hold a minimum of three meetings to receive briefings, gather information, deliberate critical issues, and write its report.

There is an increasing need to reduce the energy costs of data processing, storage and communications, as well as for guaranteed security and authentication in both communication and computation systems. Quantum technologies offer a viable ""Beyond-Moore's-Law"" strategy, especially in communications and information processing, where quantum optics has clearly demonstrated beyond-classical advantages in a number of landmark experiments. But the traditional approach of quantum optics relies on table-top laboratory experiments usually conducted at extremely low temperatures, and requiring large and expensive ancillary equipment for successful operation. These constraints inhibit the transition of quantum optics research into practical applications and everyday usage. This project will use the same technology as used to make integrated circuits in the electronics industry today to develop a new generation of energy-efficient, non-cryogenically cooled microchips for secure and efficient optical communications. Development of these microchips will also benefit sensors and standards calibration, metrology, and low-light-level imaging. The transition of laboratory research to real-world applications will be helped by leveraging scalable and cost-effective foundry-based manufacturing technologies to make devices.  Research collaborations with industry and government laboratories will provide broader perspective as well as scope for field applications and student mentoring. The project will also support the development and dissemination of educational modules that introduce quantum mechanics through optics for high schools (including material for laboratory experiments) and undergraduate students, including future engineers who traditionally have not learnt about quantum mechanics and its potential engineering applications. <br/><br/>The technical goal of this project is to design, fabricate and demonstrate microchips for quantum communications using entanglement over conventional optical fiber. Research will focus on creating ultra-compact (centimeter-scale) microchips which miniaturize previous table-top or bread-board apparatus for generating and detecting entangled, heralded and single photons, for quantum memories without requiring cryogenic cooling, and for demonstrations of quantum key distribution protocols. Scalable manufacturing techniques based on established micro-electronics foundry platforms will be utilized, which may result in reducing the cost and mitigating some of the risks of making greater quantities of devices for practical applications. Integrated pair-generation and single photon devices will be designed for encoding time-bin information with gigahertz-rate clocking. Key linear optical quantum information processing devices will be designed, such as up-conversion devices, uncooled waveguide-coupled quantum memory using storage and retrieval of photons, and an electro-optically switched recirculating loop which combines both planar and fiber technology and enables synchronization of photons over long relative delays. Microchips will be characterized in a fiber-based testbed for demonstrating the protocol of measurement device independent quantum key distribution. Many of these components and measurements will be also useful for a future fully-integrated quantum repeater in optically connected communication networks."

Current encryption methods rely on computational hardness, assuming that an adversary has limited computational power to break the encryption. Quantum computing using computers operating on quantum information instead of classical information challenges this paradigm, since the computational power of quantum computers is different from that of existing computers, with the exact boundaries still unknown. At the same time, communication using quantum technologies can provide security guaranteed by the fundamental laws of physics instead of computational hardness. This is based on the ""no-cloning theorem"" of quantum mechanics, which states that quantum information cannot be copied and is therefore resistant to eavesdropping in any form. <br/><br/>Current implementations of quantum communication systems are limited to distances less than several hundred kilometers because the transmission of light through optical fibers is attenuated significantly at these lengths. This is vastly insufficient to reach across a continent or an ocean. Classical communications systems overcome this obstacle by using repeaters, which are amplifiers that boost the signal strength periodically over a long link. This technology cannot be applied to quantum information, because amplification is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. Protocols have been developed to extend the range of quantum communications indefinitely using quantum memories that can store quantum information. These are referred to as ""quantum repeaters"", although they do not amplify signals and are only loosely analogous to repeaters for classical communications networks. The basic elements of a quantum repeater system have been demonstrated in proof-of-principle laboratory experiments; however, this technology cannot practically be scaled to large systems. <br/><br/>The proposing team will develop scalable technologies for quantum repeaters, including new quantum memories, efficient interfaces to integrate and use those memories, and new protocols for quantum communication. The project focuses on designing optical nano-structures to efficiently interface with single-atom impurities in solids that act as quantum memories, as well as to efficiently detect and frequency-convert single photons. Additionally, the team will explore the theory of quantum information systems to identify ways to leverage the specific capabilities of these experimental systems, which will result in new protocols and encodings for quantum networks.<br/><br/>Technical description: The overall goal of this project is to develop chip-scale, integrated, nanophotonic components for scalable, long-distance quantum communication based on a quantum repeater architecture.

This thermal energy migrates to the surface of the silicon chip and is dissipated by fans or other means (e.g., fluid cooling). However, as engineers seek to increase the transistor count per chip for greater computer power, silicon technology reaches its limit, and a different base material with a different hardware architecture will be needed. Recently, sheets of material have been developed which are only one atomic layer thick and which may function as semiconductors (transition metal dichalcogenides), conductors (graphene), or insulators (boron nitride)?the main elements of any electronic device. Transistors have already been developed by stacking these different atomic layers. However, the power density and tendency for such devices to overheat increase dramatically at such a small scale. Therefore, no practical devices from these materials will be possible until the physics of heat transfer at this scale is better understood and the heat dissipation problem is solved. This proposal seeks to comprehensively study the thermal transport dynamics of stacks of atomic layers of semiconductors, conductors, and insulators representative of future nano-electronic devices. The multidisciplinary team consists of a mechanical engineer, an electrical engineer, a chemist, and two physicists from three different universities. Each university has special programs for involving undergraduate and underrepresented minority students in research. The investigators will engage PhD students and undergraduate minority students as well as high school students in this combined experimental and theoretical study aimed at benefiting society through the development of a comprehensive picture of the dominant contributions and limitations of heat transport in future 2D devices.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is to provide the community with a deeper understanding of the limits set by the kinetics of dissipation and heat removal through various junctions and interfaces in two-dimensional heterogeneous materials. The team aims to establish a multiscale thermal transport study through a closely coupled combination of material synthesis and device-level experiments, atomic-level characterization, thermal transport and phonon spectroscopy, theoretical modelling, and computational studies. Transformative synthesis/fabrication methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition, will be used to produce hetero-structures of interest as fundamental components of any electronic devices. The in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity of the synthesized structures will be measured using a custom-designed electrical thermometry platform. The length scale dependence of thermal conductivity and the mean free path (MFP) distribution of heat-carrying phonons will also be measured by heterodyne transient grating technique. In-situ scanning thermal microscopy characterization will be performed to study self-heating of selected semiconducting 2D materials at their contact metal electrodes under high-power operational conditions. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy will be used to characterize 2D material interfaces and surfaces. Characterization results will guide molecular dynamics simulations to predict the atomic structures of interfaces and grain boundaries and to quantify the effects of small-scale structural variations on thermal transport properties of the materials. Thermal transport, including the full spectrum of phonon MFPs, will be calculated using the phonon Boltzmann transport equations including intrinsic phonon scattering as well as scattering at interfaces. The simulation results and Boltzmann transport calculations of phonon MFP distributions will be benchmarked against the transient grating measurements and device level data to develop a predictive model for thermal dissipation in 2D heterogeneous materials. The proposed research has a transformative potential and is of high relevance across many research fields. The broader impacts of this work will be significant in enabling the design of new classes of 2D heterogeneous materials for future electronics/optoelectronics from a thermal management perspective."

Mechanical metamaterials attempt to achieve this by building an aggregate system out of linear or nonlinear components, that collectively exhibit material properties and functionalities that differ from, and surpass those of, their constituent materials.  However, their functionality is typically compromised by defects and imperfections, which are unavoidable in real world applications. This begs the question of whether a new paradigm exists, whereby a new class of building blocks and interactions enables the design of materials that are robust to imperfections and that are characterized by new functionalities. These studies will demonstrate that concepts from topology provide an organizing principle that gives rise to a wide range of impurity-immune phenomena in areas such as wave guiding, structural stability, and fracture. The project findings will have implications for the design and fabrication of mechanical energy control systems and devices whose operation relies on wave focusing, amplification, localization and attenuation. These include ultrasonic acoustic transducers, sonars, noise absorbing or enhancing devices, and material systems for vibration filtering and impact/blast protection.  The objectives of the project will be achieved through the collaboration of a team that combines experts in topological mechanical metamaterials, experimental wave dynamics, linear and nonlinear wave propagation, condensed matter physics and mathematics. This multi-disciplinary approach to research is rich in opportunities for outreach and for broadening participation of underrepresented groups in engineering and science. For example, outreach programs to underrepresented groups will be organized in collaboration with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.<br/> <br/>This project investigates topological mechanical metamaterials that challenge classical notions in mechanics such as reciprocity, time reversal symmetry and sensitivity to defects. The objective is to investigate their fundamental properties, such as the existence of topological modes in ordered, disordered and amorphous systems, the effects of nonlinearities, as well as energy transport in the bulk. Guided by these studies, the research team will then explore the engineering implications of topological mechanical metamaterials, focusing on wave guiding, structural stability and fracture. These investigations will be conducted on novel experimental platforms ranging from gyroscopic systems as proof-of-concepts, to newly designed continuous systems that have potential for material/structural system development. The research is expected to enable functionalities that shift the paradigm in which dynamic control devices and materials are designed. The team's unique strengths in theory, simulation and experiments provide the combination of skills that are essential for the successful execution of this ambitious research program."

This process can propagate back and forth between interdependent systems in a cascading fashion, resulting in a catastrophic widespread failure. In addition, the diverse human behaviors to disruptions, such as drivers? reaction to gridlock, can further complicate the cascading behaviors. Radically new models and analytical techniques are needed to assess and design resilient interdependent systems.<br/><br/>In this project, a team of five investigators from the domains of computer science, optimization, transportation systems, power engineering, and social science will work together to gain a better understanding of cascading failure phenomena, develop tractable mathematical models for designing resilient interdependent systems, and investigate innovative strategies to enhance the resilience of interdependent systems by preventing the occurrence of cascading failures and quickly restoring system operations. This research will lay a foundation in understanding the fundamental properties that contribute to the robustness of interdependent systems under disruptions, and thus, advancing the state-of-the-art in modern complex network theory and optimization algorithms. The transformative contributions of the project are as follows. The investigators will offer the first models that can characterize the scale and depth of cascading failures in interdependent systems, introduce the new concept of ""human vulnerability"", and provide the first model on identifying critical network elements based on serviceability. The findings of the research will provide timely support for public and private agencies to better understand the impacts of cascading failures and the implications of protecting critical elements, and develop policies to enhance the resilience of the interdependent infrastructure systems. In particular, the findings can potentially diversify the choices of these policies for managing transportation networks and power grids. The research results will also enrich the literature in the areas of network science, graph theory, optimization, communications, transportation systems, power engineering, and social science. The project will involve students at all levels, with emphasis on attracting students from underrepresented groups. The real-world applications will offer an ideal platform to engage undergraduate and K-12 students and to reach out to practitioners and policy makers.<br/><br/>Via a combination of theoretical (mathematical modeling and optimization) and applied (domain expertise) approaches, this project will comprehensively investigate vulnerability and resilience issues in interdependent systems. As specific steps towards this goal, the investigators will pursue five interdisciplinary research tasks: 1) analyzing the mechanisms of cascading failures in interdependent systems by mathematically quantifying the ""depth"" and ""breadth"" of cascades; 2) identifying critical elements (nodes and/or links) whose removal yields the most significant loss of resilience of interdependent systems; 3) enhancing the resilience of interdependent systems via optimal addition of inter-network links and finding adaptive control strategies to rapidly react to the cascading behaviors before the systems decay into full-blown failure; 4) investigating ""human vulnerability"" associated with critical elements, and deriving metrics of human vulnerability, which will be further integrated into the mathematical models of interdependent systems to refine the detection of critical elements; 5) applying the proposed rigorous mathematical models and algorithms to the real-world interdependent networks in Florida, which consist of power grids, communication networks, and transportation networks, with an impact of human behavior."

The second layer consists of a crystalline silicon that is reserved primarily for the silicon electronics that serve the quantum optical devices on the chip as well as opto-electronic devices such as electro-optic modulators. The third layer is hydrogenated amorphous silicon, which has the highest nonlinearity of any integrated photonic material.

This process can propagate back and forth between interdependent systems in a cascading fashion, resulting in a catastrophic widespread failure. In addition, the diverse human behaviors to disruptions, such as drivers? reaction to gridlock, can further complicate the cascading behaviors. Radically new models and analytical techniques are needed to assess and design resilient interdependent systems.<br/><br/>In this project, a team of five investigators from the domains of computer science, optimization, transportation systems, power engineering, and social science will work together to gain a better understanding of cascading failure phenomena, develop tractable mathematical models for designing resilient interdependent systems, and investigate innovative strategies to enhance the resilience of interdependent systems by preventing the occurrence of cascading failures and quickly restoring system operations. This research will lay a foundation in understanding the fundamental properties that contribute to the robustness of interdependent systems under disruptions, and thus, advancing the state-of-the-art in modern complex network theory and optimization algorithms. The transformative contributions of the project are as follows. The investigators will offer the first models that can characterize the scale and depth of cascading failures in interdependent systems, introduce the new concept of ?human vulnerability?, and provide the first model on identifying critical network elements based on serviceability. The findings of the research will provide timely support for public and private agencies to better understand the impacts of cascading failures and the implications of protecting critical elements, and develop policies to enhance the resilience of the interdependent infrastructure systems. In particular, the findings can potentially diversify the choices of these policies for managing transportation networks and power grids. The research results will also enrich the literature in the areas of network science, graph theory, optimization, communications, transportation systems, power engineering, and social science. The project will involve students at all levels, with emphasis on attracting students from underrepresented groups. The real-world applications will offer an ideal platform to engage undergraduate and K-12 students and to reach out to practitioners and policy makers.<br/><br/>Via a combination of theoretical (mathematical modeling and optimization) and applied (domain expertise) approaches, this project will comprehensively investigate vulnerability and resilience issues in interdependent systems. As specific steps towards this goal, the investigators will pursue five interdisciplinary research tasks: 1) analyzing the mechanisms of cascading failures in interdependent systems by mathematically quantifying the ""depth"" and ""breadth"" of cascades; 2) identifying critical elements (nodes and/or links) whose removal yields the most significant loss of resilience of interdependent systems; 3) enhancing the resilience of interdependent systems via optimal addition of inter-network links and finding adaptive control strategies to rapidly react to the cascading behaviors before the systems decay into full-blown failure; 4) investigating ""human vulnerability"" associated with critical elements, and deriving metrics of human vulnerability, which will be further integrated into the mathematical models of interdependent systems to refine the detection of critical elements; 5) applying the proposed rigorous mathematical models and algorithms to the real-world interdependent networks in Florida, which consist of power grids, communication networks, and transportation networks, with an impact of human behavior."

It is essential to numerous fields including microelectronics, optoelectronics and thermoelectrics. Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials open new opportunities for addressing this important need.  While the vast amount of research on 2D layered structures has been focused on the 2D carbon crystal, graphene, the goal of the current project will be to fabricate and to understand the properties of 2D layered structures based on Germanium (Ge) and tin (Sn).  These Ge/Sn graphane analogue structures offer the possibility to manipulate the electronic, optical and heat transport properties by adjusting the number of layers, chemical composition of constituent layers and tunable chemical bonding between layers, as well as showing great promise for a wide range of electronic and thermoelectric applications. State-of-the-art materials synthesis, measurements and theoretical modeling methodologies will be established for understanding how to tune electronic and thermal transport in 2D materials beyond graphene. Furthermore, we will develop a novel, scalable route towards integrating 2D materials directly into existing semiconductor growth and fabrication technology.  Complementing the project's major research goals are its broader aims, which include efforts to enhance thermal science education in the participating institutions, and to increase awareness in local communities of the importance and excitement of cutting edge research in thermal sciences, which has often been perceived as a mature field because of insufficient interactions between the research community and the public.  Finally, this multi-institutional collaboration will allow the research team to carry out a joint effort to recruit and retain students from underrepresented groups across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>Technical: The overall research objective of this project is to develop the fundamental knowledge needed for enhancing the coupled electronic and thermal properties of Ge/Sn graphane analogues, a promising system that offers the ability to vary the anisotropic electronic and thermal properties along both the in-plane and cross-plane directions by using different main group elements and different surface-terminating ligands. To accomplish this, a novel, scalable synthesis method will be developed for the direct integration of Ge/Sn van der Waals heterostructures into existing semiconductor fabrication processes, by combining the epitaxial growth of precursor thin films on Ge(111) wafers with their topotactic conversion into the van der Waals material. These ""epitopotaxial"" structures will facilitate a comprehensive suite of cutting edge measurements of in-plane and cross-plane electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric properties of single sheets, multilayer heterostructures, bulk 2D crystals, and different substrate-2D interfaces.  These measurements will in turn be supported by first-principle theoretical calculations to verify, predict and establish the underlying principles for controlling anisotropic thermal and electronic properties of these 2D van der Waals heterostructured materials.

Tremendous progress has been made on materials and device fabrication of terahertz/infrared detection in the past decades. However, the conventional technologies only allow detection of single wave lengths with one active element in device, severely hampering the miniature and functionality of terahertz/infrared sensors. This EFRI team will harness topological insulator, a recent breakthrough in condensed matter physics. The team aims to engineer topological interface states residing at the boundary between a topological insulator and a conventional semiconductor. Such interface states are robust against imperfection due to topologically non-trivial electronic structure of topological insulator. Furthermore, topological interface states host rich spin-texture in momentum space, which opens the possibility of tuning their hybridization with electrical voltage (gating) and magnetic field. The team will address the challenges of materials synthesis, realization of optoelectronic and spintronic devices, and their characterizations. The device concepts envisioned in this project are potentially game-changing technologies, directly addressing the grand challenge and national need on the terahertz/infrared technological areas. Education and training of students is seamlessly integrated to the research activities, which enable them to learn fundamental material science, to master advanced microscopic techniques, and more importantly, to learn independent thinking. This project also integrates education and training of under-represented undergraduate students through various programs at Rutgers, RPI and John Hopkins, and of high school students through the Partner in Science program of Liberty Science Center. <br/><br/>Topological insulators are novel quantum states of matter, which host helical Dirac surface states within their bulk band gap. These robust topological surface states are immune to backscattering because of their spin-momentum locking, in contrast to the conventional 2-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) that reside at interfaces in conventional heterostructures. The objective of this project is to explore novel device applications by engineering the topological states at the interfaces of topological insulators with semiconductors.  Preliminary theoretical work shows that these topological interface states can be qualitatively different from the surface states of the free surfaces in that they have completely different textures of spin-momentum locking. With the guidance of advanced first principle theory and modeling (Zhang+West), high quality thin films and heterostructures of topological insulators will be synthesized with state-of-the-art MBE (Oh), and characterized with transport (Oh), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (Wu) and THz and optical spectroscopy (Armitage). The intimate feedback between theory, synthesis and characterization promises novel device physics and applications.  The specific goals of the proposed work include two specific devices in the form of a tunable THz range photon detector and a source of fully polarized spin polarized current.   These are both game changing technologies.  Although many possible devices have been proposed for this class of materials, little has been actually realized thus far.   With recent advances by these PIs and their areas of expertise, the time is ripe for a concerted push in these applications of topological insulators."

The project will involve multiple cross-disciplinary teams of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who will be trained for successful careers in science and engineering. A 6-week summer course is also planned to inspire and train high school students for the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The project will start by examining the single chromatin fiber problem through exploitation of the ""heat shock response"" that enables cells to survive high temperatures through activation of heat shock genes.

The reciprocity follows from the fundamental property of the wave equation - time reversal symmetry. This project investigates a new mechanism of non-reciprocal or unidirectional propagation of sound in viscous medium. A common viewpoint is that while dissipation breaks time-reversibility, this is not sufficient to induce different transmission along two opposite directions. However, this is not valid in case of a viscous fluid. It will be shown that sound propagating in viscous medium through a phononic crystal with broken P-symmetry does not follow the reciprocity theorem. More specifically, we investigate how differential dissipation arising in the Navier-Stokes equation leads to significant non-reciprocal effects without the requirement of dynamic energy input, and expand that to new classes of non-reciprocal structures including non-reciprocal hyperbolic metamaterials. The transmission through a 2D disordered phononic crystal with non-reciprocity will also be studied. The presence of disorder in an individual scatterer results in localization of sound waves - an effect termed Anderson localization. This effect will be utilized to achieve encryption, which can be used to develop secure communication of acoustic signal both in air and water."

Devices that serve as one-way lanes for light propagation can revolutionize communication system design by adding new functionalities in a compact and more energy-efficient way.  Similarly, electronics can be made more energy-efficient by suppressing back scattering.  New discoveries in the past decade in the physics of wave propagation in materials have given tantalizing hints as to how one may achieve one-way devices for light and electron waves.  Taking these hints towards practical engineering devices, however, requires theoretical design and experimental advances in materials and device fabrication.  By bringing together a diverse and multidisciplinary team with the necessary skills, this project aims to develop the fundamental science behind such advances and experimentally demonstrate one-way devices for future information systems.  <br/> <br/><br/>This NewLAW EFRI team will investigate topological, chiral, and non-reciprocal transport of photons, polaritons, plasmons, and electron waves. This will be achieved by using specially designed material systems and device structures that provide non-trivial topological properties for electrons, for photons, and for light-matter hybrids such as non-trivial manifestations of collective plasmons and trion-polaritons. By engineering the interactions between electrons and photons in non-trivial ways, new science and new engineering technologies will be explored. Instead of photons or excitons, trions that are fermions with net charge and spin will be investigated for non-reciprocal light transport in the form of trion-polaritons. Instead of plasmons, chiral plasmons will be used for non-reciprocal transport. As a demonstration of non-reciprocal light transport, a novel optical isolator will be realized that demonstrates simultaneously high linearity, high bandwidth and high dynamic range - characteristics lacking in previous embodiments. The rich physics of non-Hermitian systems will be used to realize novel topologically-enhanced non-reciprocal waveguides. Similar non-Hermitian physics effects in the context of electron waves will be explored for electronic non-reciprocity. In this case, propagation in the evanescent complex momentum domain via electron tunneling will be explored in a device platform in specially designed material heterostructure. The EFRI team will combine theoretical research, with synthesis of new materials, and fabrication of non-reciprocal devices to achieve the above goals. Because the lack of efficient non-reciprocal wave propagation devices currently limits several functionalities in communication systems, the results of this team's research are expected to uncover new physics and engineering possibilities, contributing towards the development of communication systems that significantly affect the movement of information. The realization of the proposed devices requires a unifying theme guided by theoretical design to provide mathematical and physical understanding and guidance, experimental realization of specially designed materials such as 2D crystal heterostructures and III-Nitride semiconductors, nanofabrication of the device structures that assemble these materials in specified geometries, and finally, testing and measurement of the predicted non-reciprocal wave transport. The overarching goals are to advance the understanding of fundamental principles of non-reciprocity in novel electronic and photonic media, and to exploit these principles to realize non-reciprocal devices with superior performance. The EFRI team brings together five investigators with the precise set of skills necessary to achieve these goals."

This phenomenon stems from the fact that laws of nature governing light and its interaction with matter on a microscopic level do not prefer any particular direction of time. In other words, if we were to hypothetically reverse the direction of time, the predictions of the laws of nature would remain unaltered. Of course, at a macroscopic scale, this is not the case as we know from experience that the arrow of time has a fixed direction. It turns out that an external magnetic field can break the symmetry of time even at the microscopic scale by picking a preferred direction of propagation, which can lead to a break down of reciprocity. In current optical devices, magnets are used to cause such a one-way propagation of light, which is crucial for optical communications and the Internet. One goal of this project is to achieve non-reciprocity of light without the use of magnets by using a new class of materials, which are atomically thin. Such materials feature an effective magnetic field due to their unique crystal structure and can be used in lieu of an applied external magnetic field for one-way propagation of light. This project aims to realize miniaturized optical devices and circuit elements based on these novel materials, which will allow for faster optical switches and defect-insensitive propagation on a reduced footprint. Such devices have the potential to transform the optical telecommunication industry. During the course of this project, the research team will provide science education and research experiences in cutting-edge technologies to middle school, undergraduate and graduate students, including those students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, in an effort to enhance the science and engineering workforce of tomorrow. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to realize on-chip, non-reciprocal nanophotonic devices and circuit elements operating at optical frequencies and topologically protected edge states for photons. Such devices will feature novel functionalities such as reconfigurable one-way propagation and steering of light. Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information in a time-independent and linear system requires broken time-reversal symmetry, which can be achieved by an external magnetic field. We will achieve non-reciprocal propagation at nanoscale in a magnetic-free way with the possibility of active control by external stimuli. Our approach will employ atomically thin materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides with unique electronic and optical properties to achieve these goals. In these materials, which break inversion symmetry, an effective magnetic field in the momentum-space called the Berry curvature is present. Although no net Berry curvature is present in these materials, electric control offers the possibility of spatially local time-reversal breaking and non-reciprocal propagation. In addition, we will rely on the strong light-matter interactions and non-linearity in these materials to increase non-reciprocity and also to realize topologically protected edge states of light. To this end, optical and plasmonic nano-cavities, which enhance light-matter interactions, will be exploited. This research project will advance our fundamental understanding of effective gauge-fields like Berry curvature in low-dimensional materials and how strong light-matter interactions can be exploited to achieve on-chip, reconfigurable non-reciprocity and topological states of light-matter."

Targeted participants are late stage graduate students, early stage faculty, and postdoctoral scholars who show potential for engaging in cross-institutional interdisciplinary research linking scholars from American Indian Tribal Colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Colleges and Universities, and Land Grant Universities. Two important societal impacts are anticipated. Firstly, enhancing the ability of researchers to address key national/global challenges is expected to confer both social and economic benefit. Secondly, collaboration with minority-serving institutions should increase the participation, training and professional advancement of historically underserved populations.<br/><br/>The proposed platform uses existing knowledge on learning and ideation with the goal of fostering creativity and interdisciplinary approaches. Specifically, favorable conditions for hatching transformative research ideas include: interaction of multiple, radically different perspectives; engaging in a structured collaboration process; and working through multiple cycles of ideation, gestation and crystallization. The initial EAGER award to this group demonstrated proof-of-principle for this approach through focusing on resilience to global climate change. Under the aegis of the renewal award, two additional cohorts will be assembled focusing on distinct societal challenges (Food and Water Security; Energy Sustainability) to refine and extend this framework, and thereby test the generalizability of the approach. The research team will be composed of personnel from the American Indian Higher Education Council (AIHEC), the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), and from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). A repeated measures design will enable collection of multiple behavioral metrics. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of dynamics across groups will explore the framework's capacity to identify, codify, and execute creative ideas. Anticipated project outcomes are: (1) creative idea generation; (2) sustainable cross-institutional and interdisciplinary networks to promote future research addressing scientific grand challenges; (3) a refined procedure for facilitating the first two outcomes; and (4) evidence of efficacy and scalability. The inclusion of minority-serving institutions in a way that gives them true voice breaks new ground in this area of inquiry.

One-way propagation of waves is emerging as a novel phenomenon that can disrupt ways in which current technologies employ waves.  Conventionally and intuitively, one expects waves to propagate equally well in the forward or backward directions, however, certain media can break this symmetry.  One-way or unidirectional propagation, also called non-reciprocal propagation of waves, restricts the transmission to only one direction.  This unconventional property may enable totally new functionalities and ultimately new technologies and devices. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of solid materials that can support non-reciprocal propagation of elastic waves. Similar to the advent of the electrical diode, in which non-reciprocal elements formed the basis for modern electronics and computing, this research will enable future devices, whose operation relies on processing information transported by elastic waves in solids. Examples of such devices are surface or bulk acoustic wave devices as well as opto-mechanical systems used in telecommunication. This research involves several disciplines including materials science, mechanics, photonics and physics. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The project will investigate solid chalcogenide glasses and phase change materials as a platform to produce surface and bulk elastic waves with unidirectional propagation.

Currently, quantum-secure communication distance is limited to less than 100 km by photon absorption in fibers. Theoretically, this limitation can be overcome by a network of quantum repeaters relying on entanglement between communication nodes. The experimental quantum communication community has primarily focused on higher performance metrics for a single device. As a result, proof-of-principle experiments illustrating the potential of quantum technologies for secure communication have been realized utilizing physically large, expensive, and non-scalable technologies at cryogenic temperatures. The critical question remains whether long-distance communication, utilizing quantum repeaters, can be realized in a scalable platform. To reach this goal, this work employs two transformative approaches. First, an integrated hybrid-materials platform that has the potential to realize all device functionalities required for a quantum transmitter is adopted. Second, state-of-the-art computational techniques are utilized to design photonic devices that exhibit unprecedented nonlinear capabilities, enabling the desired performance under the constraints of compatibility with semiconductor fabrication processing.  In particular, compact devices are designed to efficiently extract photons emitted by a defect in diamond; the extracted photons are then routed into a nonlinear device that efficiently converts them to telecom wavelengths; finally, the photons are coupled into an optical fiber for low-loss, long-distance propagation. The technologies engineered to reach this goal are expected to also advance the current state of optical information processing and sensing, due to improved nonlinear optical and reconfigurable devices. The diverse team of investigators will train the next generation of photonics engineers in skills including nanophotonic design, nanofabrication, optical spectroscopy, and integrated quantum technologies for tomorrow's optoelectronics industry.

Emission of spin-entangled photons from diamond color centers will be enhanced by a waveguide-coupled resonant plasmonic device, providing an avenue toward operation at elevated temperature. These photons will be spectrally filtered and dynamically routed via an optical switching network to an integrated quantum frequency converter. The resulting telecom-wavelength single photons will be further filtered before off-chip coupling to a fiber-optic cable. The design of the resonant enhancement and nonlinear frequency conversion devices will be performed by a novel inverse-design method based on topology optimization that has only recently become tractable with available computation resources. Several key avenues are identified to mitigate against unavoidable device inhomogeneities and enhance the prospects for scalability. Nonlinear frequency conversion will simultaneously perform frequency conversion and spectral which-path erasure necessary for quantum entanglement. Tunable ring resonators simultaneously provide filtering and routing capabilities.

Efforts are underway across the globe to develop such technologies in a range of physical systems, including atoms, superconductors, and atom-like emitters in solids. This NSF program will focus on semiconductor materials: specifically, it will use nitrogen vacancy (NV) and silicon vacancy (SiV) color centers in diamond, which recently emerged as leading platforms for solid-state quantum memories and single photon sources.  <br/><br/>After successful proof-of-principle demonstrations of many of the basic elements, a central challenge today is to devise new methods of device fabrication, component integration, and scalable fault-tolerant protocols to realize functional and scalable systems. These are the goals of this program, with a focus on semiconductor quantum devices for quantum secure communications. To this end, the program will develop a new generation of quantum light sources, and error-corrected quantum memories along with theoretical protocols with improved fault tolerance. These advances represent critical steps towards deployable and scalable quantum networks that have the potential to provide unhackable cryptography, new forms of quantum computing, precision measurement, and a host of other applications not possible on classical networks used today.<br/>     <br/>Technical Description:<br/>     <br/>This program will develop critical solid-state technology for quantum networks with applications including quantum communication, metrology, and computing. In Thrust 1, we will develop photostable and spectrally pure room-temperature single photon sources, based on color centers in diamond -- specifically, the silicon vacancy (SiV) and nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers. Thrust 1 will also advance the quantum coherence times of these color centers, as well as their scalable integration in photonic integrated circuits. In Thrust 2, we will develop a new generation of error-corrected quantum nodes based on engineered multi-qubit registers and new quantum algorithms designed from the ground up for fault tolerance. In Thrust 3, we will demonstrate entanglement distribution of error-corrected quantum memories across a deployed dark fiber network in the Boston area. The nodes will consist of photonic integrated circuits for multiplexing multiple quantum registers. In contrast to previous quantum repeater protocols, our effort will focus on logical qubits in multi-qubit registers and new heralding concepts for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum networks.<br/>     <br/>The research program will advance nanofabrication techniques, with a specific focus on quantum devices for quantum information processing.

In addition to the primary focus on quantum information devices, the advanced fabrication techniques and nanophotonic diamond devices promise breakthroughs in emerging applications such as nonlinear and high power optics, microelectronics, and applications in thermal management where diamond is used as a heat sink. The progress in the control of quantum emitters will also have a direct impact on biomedical and chemical sensing. <br/><br/>A substantial portion of our program is focused on communicating the proposed research and development efforts to the public.

The project builds on successful pilot studies of teaching ideation and questioning, and seeks ultimately to develop formalized teaching modules that could be disseminated for use beyond the University of Iowa. This study has two potential Broader Impacts. Firstly, the training programs under development may inculcate in all participants a deepened ability to relate scientific research to societal needs. Secondly, the training programs may make scientific idea-framing and questioning processes more visible and accessible to underrepresented groups, including first-generation students, facilitating their engagement with STEM careers, and thereby diversifying and strengthening the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This project will use case studies of celebrated, high-achieving scientists for training graduate students in ambitious scientific ideation and questioning tethered to societal needs. Two different approaches will be compared in parallel to identify their affordances and limitations. The first is a semester-length course that will step chemistry and engineering graduate students through processes of ideation and question development using a well scaffolded 16-week framework. The second approach involves an informal drop-in weekly seminar/workshop (Reading-Writing Workshop; RWW) that will run for a year. Both courses will share some elements, including employing case studies to enable the students to tease out the processes of ideation and questioning, leveraging social scientists to provide larger perspectives on societal needs, and introducing a conceptual framework that connects critical societal needs to the guiding questions of physical science research communities. Case study work will include reviewing papers, memoirs, letter, and oral histories of significant scientists to explore their processes of idea generation, questioning of key assumptions, and integration of disciplinary approaches. The underlying hypothesis is that through considering ways in which important scientific ideas and questions are generated graduate students will develop both increased desire and increased ability to formulate and engage with important questions. Outcome evaluation will include Likert-based and qualitative assessments based on existing instruments for measuring student learning.

A seminal example is the quantum network. In contrast to a classical communication networks, a quantum network stores and transmits information using quantum objects such as single atoms and single photons. By doing so, a quantum network can communicate with unconditional security and anonymity, and can also interconnect quantum computers to form a quantum internet. But realizing these technological capabilities requires the ability to store and transmit quantum information while preserving the delicate quantum state of the system. Ions trapped in electric fields constitute the best quantum memory to date. They can store quantum information for times exceeding tens of minutes, and can also emit single photons, the ideal carriers of quantum information that are entangled with quantum memory. But a number of significant challenges remain before a trapped-ion quantum network can become a reality. Ions emit visible- and ultraviolet-wavelength photons that are not compatible with fiber-optic networks. These photons must also be processed with high efficiency without destroying the delicate quantum signals that they carry.  In this program, we will combine silicon-chip traps and integrated photonics to overcome these challenges.  If successful, this project will provide the core hardware for a scalable and efficient quantum network that can process and transmit quantum information with unprecedented speed and distance.<br/><br/>Technical abstract: By combining integrated photonics with silicon-based ion-chip traps, we will develop the technology for scalable quantum networks based on compact, chip-integrated quantum hardware operating at room temperature. Trapped ions are currently the leading platform for quantum information processing, with coherence times exceeding tens of minutes. They are also one of the few room-temperature sources of indistinguishable single photons that can exhibit the two-photon interference effects required for photon-mediated quantum interactions. The program will utilize micro-fabricated ion-chip traps to assemble and manipulate atomic ion chains on a silicon chip that serve as both efficient room-temperature single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. Integrated photonic structures will process photons originating from multiple ion traps to mediate long-distance quantum interactions at unprecedented efficiencies and fidelities. Integrated nonlinear photonic devices will furthermore convert photons emitted by trapped ions to telecom wavelengths for long-distance fiber propagation. The project will deploy and demonstrate compact quantum devices in a practical optical network. This highly multi-disciplinary program ultimately aims to demonstrate the fundamental operations of a quantum network, which can be used for entanglement distribution, quantum error correction, and distribution of quantum information and quantum keys."

Strongly correlated 2D materials, where the electronic phase transformation and collective excitation that determine the electronic response, and devices based on these materials (Landau switch), have the potential to become the successor of the conventional silicon technology. The logic operation is based on completely different mechanisms and the successful realization of the Landau switch concept will extend the road map of low power digital and analog circuits with large societal impact affecting both governmental and commercial sector.

Examples include microwaves that enable operation of cell phones and acoustic waves that enable ultrasound imaging. Typically these waves can freely propagate in any direction away from their sources. Many practical applications of such waves could be improved if the waves were made to propagate in only one specific direction. For example, such unidirectional waves enable communication devices that can simultaneously send and receive signals using the same antenna ? this is called full duplex communications. One goal of this project is to create new magnetic materials, in which microwaves and ultrasound waves propagate in only one direction. Another goal is to make a new type of very compact on-chip microwave and acoustic devices called circulators that are based on these novel materials. Such circulators are the core elements making the full duplex communications possible. In the course of this project, the principal investigators will train a number of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, in modern materials engineering, nanofabrication, and microwave measurement techniques, which will enhance the U.S. science and engineering workforce.<br/><br/>This project has two major goals: (i) development of chiral materials and meta-materials supporting strongly non-reciprocal spin waves and magneto-acoustic waves and (ii) demonstration of acoustic signal circulators and reconfigurable microwave circulators, which are based on the non-reciprocal waves. Two approaches to the generation of non-reciprocal waves will be employed. In the first approach, the wave non-reciprocity in magnetic films will be induced either via anti-symmetric exchange interactions by doping interfaces with heavy elements or via spin-flexoelectric interactions by applying an electric field perpendicular to the film surface. In the second approach, novel magnetic metamaterials lacking inversion symmetry will be made from arrays of ferromagnetic nano-elements. In these meta-materials, several types of non-reciprocal spin waves can be excited including spectrally protected modes and topologically protected edge states. By employing materials with strong resonant magneto-elastic coupling, the spin-wave non-reciprocity is transferred to magneto-acoustic waves. Non-reciprocal magnetic meta-materials developed under this program will be used to make and test acoustic wave circulators based on non-reciprocal, topologically protected chiral magneto-acoustic waves propagating along the meta-material edges. A reconfigurable ultra-compact microwave circulator based on spin-flexoelectric interactions in ferrimagnetic thin films will be made and tested. The direction of microwave signal propagation in this device can be rapidly controlled via external bias voltage. This research project will advance our understanding of non-reciprocal waves in magnetic meta-materials and will result in the development of a new class of ultra-compact, on-chip, non-reciprocal signal processing devices."

Scientifically, this program will allow optics community to deepen the fundamental understanding of electro-optical properties and light-matter interaction in two dimensional and layered materials under strong external stimuli. The proposed research may also lead to possible commercialization of inventions through the collaboration with industry partners. Moreover, the proposed program represents a cohesive effort which integrates advanced research and educational and broadening participation activities.

Furthermore, they will leverage the research opportunities provided by this program to enhance the participation of high school students especially for those from underrepresented groups. The team will disseminate the results of this proposed research in a timely manner to a broader society through journal publications, conference presentations, or news release through the university and general media to promote the public awareness of the importance of scientific research. <br/><br/>Nonreciprocal photonic devices that break the time-reversal symmetry can be used for critical applications such as optical isolation and circulation for modern photonic systems. Thus, non-reciprocity devices have the potential to transform a wide range of fields in photonics, such as on-chip optical information processing, communication, and imaging. The conventional approach to achieve nonreciprocity mainly relies on bulky structures to realize substantial magneto-optic Faraday rotation, and the devices usually occupy a large footprint, posing significant challenges in integrated photonic systems. In this NewLAW project, the team proposes to develop electrically driven nonreciprocal photonic devices operating in a broad wavelength range from visible to mid-infrared by exploiting the widely tunable light-matter interaction using electric bias in atomically thin two-dimensional materials. The team consists of five principal investigators with a diverse range of background including fundamental optical physics, photonic device design, two-dimensional materials synthesis, and device realization and characterizations. To realize nonreciprocity in such compact photonic devices, the team will leverage the giant tunability of refractive index in two-dimensional transitional metal dichalcogenides materials by electrical gating and the plasmon Doppler Effect in high mobility graphene in the presence of in-plane electrical current, guided by theoretical investigations and device performance predictions. The non-reciprocal photonic devices proposed in this program are fully compatible with the popular complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits, making them highly attractive in integrated systems. The proposed research will not only significantly advance the fundamental understanding of the light-matter interaction of two-dimensional materials with the presence of external stimuli, but also address one of the most challenging issues in modern photonic science: electrically driven optical non-reciprocity at chip-scale."

Systematic investigations will be conducted to probe the fundamental electronic properties of the 2DLM nanoplates and explore new physics originating at the interfaces in 2DLM heterostructures. Large-area assembly of 2DLM nanoplate thin films, lateral epitaxial growth to reduce or eliminate the grain boundaries, and design of new device architectures for the creation of a new generation of highly flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices will be explored. Lastly, the resulting 2DLM nanoplates will be investigated for potential applications as electrocatalysts or photocatalysts, or in energy storage applications. A fundamental understanding of the nucleation and growth mechanisms will enable the development of powerful synthetic strategies for scalable production of 2DLMs with deterministic control of all material parameters, creating a robust material system for fundamental investigation of low-dimensional physics and chemistry at the limit of single atomic thickness. The effort will establish the critical intellectual underpinnings for a new material platform of 2DLMs to enable transformative advances in diverse technologies including electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and energy conversion and storage."

This approach leverages existing infrastructure developed for commercial microwave magnetic devices. Given the critical role those devices play in wireless communication and information technology, the breadth and depth of the impact of this work will be significant. Additionally, this research program will form the foundation for broader efforts at increasing public engagement in science via local outreach activities that are designed to enhance diversity programs in STEM across the four participating university campuses (Colorado State University, University of Iowa, Ohio State University, and Yale University). <br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of novel approaches to achieving/enhancing non-reciprocity in microwave devices. Specifically, we have defined two parallel and synergistic Tracks that exploit the existing infrastructure surrounding magnetic-based microwave devices as a springboard for the development of novel device architectures based on high-fidelity self-biased magnonic crystals (Track 1) and voltage-control via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (Track 2). In both of these architectures, topologically protected propagating states will be exploited to dramatically enhance non-reciprocity in microwave devices such as circulators, isolators, and non-reciprocal filters. These projects are critically enabled by a recent materials breakthrough in which thin films of a room temperature organic-based magnet have been shown to exhibit magnetic ordering temperatures of over 600 K, quality factors in excess of 8,000 for magnetic resonance, conformal and low temperature deposition, and materials stability under ambient conditions. These projects are individually impactful and collectively synergistic, providing multiple paths to technological advances that will transform the phase space for the design of non-reciprocal microwave devices."

These new 2D materials promise a new generation of technologies such as flexible displays, ultrafast computing, high-efficiency low-cost solar cells, and quantum information processing. Specifically in the context of optoelectronics, the unusually large strength of light-matter interaction of 2D materials has made them highly attractive for practical device applications. However, single-layer graphene has no direct bandgap, which limits its use in a range of optoelectronic applications. The recent discovery of 2D atomic crystals based on transition metal dichalcogenides, many of which have large bandgaps in the visible and infrared spectrum, now opens entirely new areas of investigation in optical and optoelectronic devices. <br/>In this program, building blocks for next generation classical and quantum information processing will be developed based on precise control of electronic excited states, hybrid half-light half-matter quasiparticles (exciton-polaritons), and collective excitations in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The motivation is to develop next generation photonic and electronic systems and sub-systems that exploit the unique advantages of 2D semiconductors such as large interaction strength with light, mechanical flexibility, and low fabrication cost. Specifically, (i) low energy consuming, ultrafast logic gates will be developed using neutral and charged excitations (ii) Quantum nonlinear devices where even a single photon can alter the state of the system will be investigated using polaritons and (iii)Exotic phases of matter that rely on ideas from mathematical topology will be explored using collective excitations will be developed<br/>In addition to the technological impact on society, the program will include extensive Educational and Outreach. CCNY, the lead institution, is a minority-serving institution and through close collaboration with MIT expects both graduate and undergraduate students from diverse ethnic and social backgrounds to become part of the proposed cutting-edge research. The program will also provide educational opportunities for local underrepresented minority high school students/teachers and will engage them in summer projects. Outreach efforts for bringing the science to the general public is another targeted effort under the program.    <br/><br/>This program will develop excitonic and polaritonic (exciton-photon quasiparticles) devices that operate in the visible and near infrared spectral range based on 2D atomic layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, WSe2 etc). The 2D materials have an inherently strong interaction with light and other attractive properties such as valley polarization and strong spin-orbit coupling. These unique properties open up avenues for the development of heretofore inaccessible device features with tremendous potential applications in classical and quantum information processing. Devices that rely on control of exciton and polariton transport and localization as well as approaches to emergent topological phases in 2D materials will be the focus of this program. Specifically, the following devices/ device concepts using 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and their heterostructures will be developed: (i) transistors and logic gates that utilize neutral and charged excitons, (ii) quantum nonlinear optical devices and light emitters based on exciton polaritons, and (iii) exploratory optoelectronic device concepts based on topological phases that can be realized in 2D semiconductors. The device development will be closely guided by growth and synthesis efforts as well as theoretical efforts to better understand exciton and polariton transport and for realizing novel topological phases and strain engineering for electronic band structure manipulation. Development of excitonic and polaritonic devices based on 2D semiconductors that have the potential to operate at room temperature presents a unique opportunity to develop practical devices using previously unexplored fundamental physical concepts."

In this project, the Stanford team (Pop, Goodson, Saraswat, Wong) will explore fundamental measurements guided by computer simulations, leveraging the unique anisotropic properties of atomically thin materials. The team will also focus on thermoelectric measurements, an area that has received less attention. Applications of this research could include energy-efficient electronics generating little heat, and flexible energy harvesters for wearable sensors and medical devices. Many of the benefits and insights generated from this work could also be applicable to conventional electronics, thus further improving the return on investment for the National Science Foundation, for society, and for education. The project will educate students from high school interns through undergraduate and graduate researchers, who will be exposed to a unique training program at the Stanford Design School.

Atomic layers will be assembled into heterogeneous stacks with controlled angular orientation. (3) Examine and improve electrical inter- faces to atomically thin materials, learning how to connect them to the outside world. The team will leverage doping, and both ?surface? and ?edge? contacts to minimize electrical contact resistance. (4) Thermal and thermoelectric characterization. The researchers will examine thermal interfaces and probe dynamic changes to thermal conductivity, particularly in the cross-plane direction of the atomic layers.

The team will examine the possibility of transistors and memory that leverage built-in thermoelectric effects to shift or manipulate hot spots, and that of layered thermoelectric modules for flexible substrates and mobile environments where natural heat sinking is restricted. A key part of the intellectual significance of this project is that it combines expertise from three disciplines: Electrical, Thermal/Mechanical and Materials Engineering.

Soft robots and muscle-like soft actuators coupled with agile control strategies will enable new manipulation and locomotion capabilities currently only found in nature, and allow robots and humans to safely collaborate. Today's industrial manipulators enable rapid and precise assembly, but these robots are physically isolated, to ensure the safety of any humans nearby. In contrast, the bodies of soft robots are made of intrinsically soft and/or extensible materials, such as silicone rubbers or fabrics, and are therefore safe for interaction with humans and animals. Soft robots have a continuously deformable structure with muscle-like actuation that emulates key features of biological systems and provides them with a relatively large number of degrees of freedom as compared to their hard-bodied counterparts. Soft robots have capabilities beyond what is possible with today's rigid-bodied robots. For example, soft-bodied robots can move in more natural ways that include complex bending and twisting curvatures that are not restricted to the traditional rigid body kinematics of existing robotic manipulators. Their bodies can deform in a continuous way, providing theoretically infinite degrees of freedom and allowing them to adapt their shape to their task, for example, conforming to natural terrain or forming enveloping grasps. Soft robots have also been shown to be capable of rapid agile maneuvers and can change their stiffness to achieve a task- or environment-specific impedance. Current research on device-level and algorithmic aspects of soft robots has resulted in a range of novel soft devices. This project will derive a systematic mathematical framework to model and control soft robots and will use the resulting algorithms to perform manipulation tasks with a wide variety of delicacy and strength requirements. The results will have potential uses in manufacturing, warehouse and supply chain automation, and everyday home activities such as cooking and cleaning. These soft, strong, and safe robots will have potential application in assisted care for the elderly or disabled, and for physical therapy. This project uses the unique features of soft robots to continue the Principal Investigators' track record of outreach and educational activities that excite young students about STEM careers.<br/><br/>In the recent past, the soft robotics community has explored many different component hardware technologies, however fundamental algorithmic obstacles to their practical use remain challenging. Currently there is an artificial divide between control strategies for rigid and soft robots; rigid robots use high-bandwidth control of contact forces and contact geometry, while soft robots rely almost entirely on open-loop interactions, mediated by material properties, to govern the resulting forces and configurations. This project will bridge this gap by developing optimization-based control for soft robots, via approximate dynamic models of the soft interface, based on representations with a fidelity customized to the task. The proposed class of soft, strong, and safe robots will be designed, fabricated, and controlled by co-developing muscle-like actuation along with internal and contact models and associated planning and control strategies. An innovative new artificial muscle design allows customization of actuators to specific tasks, through systematic modular design. The modeling effort will focus on contact-rich behaviors of the soft robot with the environment, both for delicate touch and manipulation, and for high-force power grasps. Such a combination of soft and strong has not been fully addressed in the soft robotics community and will allow soft robots to interact safely and effectively with people in unprecedented applications.<br/><br/>This project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA) and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field of sound waves, which represent the oldest way of communication between human beings, is experiencing a revival in the context of modern material technology and engineering, with a myriad of applications ranging from medical imaging and echolocation to acoustic cloaking.  A fundamental principle governing wave propagation in both fluid and solid media, called ""reciprocity"", is that the transmission rate of waves must be equal forward and backward between any two arbitrarily selected points in a medium.  The ability to break this principle, that is, the realization of one-directional mechanical or acoustic ""diodes"" will enable the design of new classes of mechanical systems with novel functionalities, including adaptive sensors and vibration isolation devices. It will also provide a transformative contribution to the emerging field of material logic, a design paradigm where simple structural and material modules are used as the engineering building blocks to create mechanical devices of arbitrary complexity.  The core conceptual ideas behind the research originate from the notion of ""topological protection"", which is exploited to obtain wave propagation properties that are robust against disorder and noise. The knowledge developed through this research will advance technologies, including but not limited to: a) mechanical computing, where acoustic logic ports can be seen as building blocks capable of carrying out an array of mathematical operations, and b) devices with novel thermal transport properties, exploiting the analogy between thermal phonons and mechanical vibrations at the spatial and temporal scales of mechanical devices. The research will also be disseminated to the broader community through a workshop with public tutorials, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields through enhancing existing programs at the different academic institutions and will result in YouTube videos to share the discoveries with the general public.<br/><br/>This project will develop a fundamental understanding of how the phonon band topology governs the acoustic properties of systems experiencing spatial-temporal modulation, leading to a formal interpretation framework for this type of time-reversal symmetry breaking phenomena. The powerful toolkits to be developed through the project will allow for a rich variety of designs beyond the current boundaries of the use of topological states in acoustic wave control strategies. The research will span frontiers of condensed matter physics, wave mechanics, and materials science.  The two main conceptual ideas to be used for the realization of topologically protected nonreciprocal wave propagation are: (1) program the phonon band structure in spatial-temporal modulated materials using principles of topological band theory, and (2) exploit the contrasting wave propagation properties of Maxwell lattices in their metal-like and topological insulator-like phases.  The research team will advance the theoretical understanding of the intimate role played by topological protection in nonreciprocal wave propagation, use state-of-the-art fabrication techniques to realize prototypes of acoustic diodes at different scales using a variety of material platforms, and deploy laser-enabled wave reconstruction capabilities to characterize the nonreciprocal wave propagation phenomena in the fabricated metamaterial specimen. By developing and applying principles of topology and material logic design across the scales, the project will transform a set of simple mechanical components into a versatile platform for the next generation acoustic logic ports with programmable acoustic transport and time reversal symmetry breaking capabilities."

Most soft robots eschew the rigid links of traditional robots in favor of compliant structures.  In contrast, the robot designed in this work has its ""softness"" emerge from the interactions among granular material encased in a flexible membrane. The concept is best visualized by considering an amoeba, in which an outer membrane loosely encapsulates a set of internal components.  By allowing components on the periphery of the membrane to be active ""sub-robots,"" much like the cilia on the periphery of a paramecium, the overall structure can move and deform like a boundary-constrained robotic swarm. Moreover, to manipulate objects and exert large forces on the environment, the robot will also have the unique ability to jam. Jamming occurs when particles become packed so closely that instead of flowing past each other (like coffee grounds in a can) they form a solid (like coffee grounds in a vacuum-packed bag).  The results of this work may offer several advantages over traditional robots, including the ability to better conform to objects, physically interact with other soft structures such as animal tissue, and locomote in unstructured environments.  This could impact several national needs, including providing inherently safe robots that work with or alongside humans to greatly improve US manufacturing competitiveness. The research also includes a comprehensive broadening participation plan with an emphasis on hiring underrepresented minorities as graduate research assistants and outreach to underrepresented minorities through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. This is coupled with societal outreach that builds upon the PI's previous involvement with the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.<br/><br/>The robot developed here will be the first to expand upon the concept of granular soft robots by imagining the granules themselves as active robots. While similar to robotic swarms, this new class of robots differs significantly in that this project will be the first to examine how the aggregate of sub-robots physically interacts with its environment. To make this possible, novel modeling techniques will be created as well as sensing and actuation algorithms. Modeling will take into account both multi-body rigid dynamics for modeling the dynamics of sub-robot granules, large deformation continuum mechanics for modeling sub-robot connections, constraints to ensure the model predictions are physically viable, and Lagrangian mechanics to bring all the elements together. The sensing and actuation algorithms will exploit emergent intelligence of the boundary swarm to sense the external environment and robustly actuate distinct global behaviors in response to such distributed sensing without any centralized planning. The project enhances infrastructure through melding concepts and researchers from multiple disparate disciplines. In engineering, this includes dynamics and control, mechanics of materials and structures, materials engineering, and formal design theory. In physics, it encompasses areas of soft condensed matter, in particular the concepts of the jamming phase transition and the dynamics of ""active matter.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is made possible by recent advances in fabrication techniques that allow artificial elements to be combined with an array of living cell types such as muscles and neurons. The proposed mini bio-hybrid robots are thus compliant, configurable, biocompatible, and can generate power from local nutrients. Bio-hybrid robots can also exhibit adaptive behaviors in response to uncertain environments, and thus offer the promise of a host of high impact applications including localized drug delivery, environmental exploration and chemical sensing, evaluation of potential surgical sites within the body, and precision manipulation and fabrication. This is in line with the national need to reduce healthcare costs by enhancing medical effectiveness as well as stimulating the development of advanced manufacturing techniques to increase competitiveness. This effort speaks to a broad audience: what can spark the imagination of potential young scientists better than bringing tiny robots to life. Excitement in this area will be leveraged via activities ranging from museum exhibitions to the deployment of high school and K-12 intuitive learning modules, in order to foster interest in advanced computing, mechanics, math, manufacturing, and biology.<br/><br/>Soft robotics is currently constrained by a lack of rigorous engineering methods. Intuition-driven approaches are further strained in the case of bio-hybrid systems due to the inclusion of the living component, which is even less well understood.

Central to this project is the concept of functional units, hierarchical bio-hybrid assemblies that can be combined into integrated robotic systems capable of higher level functions, much like the organization of living organisms and object-oriented software. By embracing this analogy, five fundamental building blocks (muscle and neuron cells, elastomers, multi-stable buckling structures, wireless conformable electronics) are considered, so as to: (1) introduce a novel mathematical formalism based on Cosserat rod assemblies to model their mechanical response, actuation and interaction with the environment; (2) develop software to simulate the dynamics of composite functional units and to optimize them according to a desired target behavior; (3) fabricate and test obtained solutions, and update models based on experiments; (4) showcase new understanding by engineering integrated bots able to perform complex tasks.

But optical transport that only lets light pass one-way, termed ""non-reciprocal propagation"", is vital for energy reduction and noise suppression in telecommunications. The generation of non-reciprocity requires breaking time-reversal symmetry, and typically can be realized in magneto-optical materials via the Faraday effect (where light passing through a material is subject to an external magnetic field, thus changing the light wave orientation). This fundamental requirement of an external magnetic field places significant limitations on device miniaturization and on-chip integration.  This program researches a new material platform ""gapped Dirac materials"" whose intrinsic Berry curvature, a key and newly-recognized property of their energy band structure, can act as an effective magnetic field - thus giving rise to unique chiral edge plasmon resonances that can facilitate non-reciprocal light propagation. The outcome of this research will enable compact, magnetic-field-free (and thus lightweight and energy-efficient) tunable nonreciprocal devices for optical communications and quantum information processing. This project will train graduate and under-represented students in STEM in a multidisciplinary environment; provide outreach to the public through programs such as Research Experience for Teachers, ""Science on Tap"" public lectures, and ""Broaden the Horizon"" that focuses on middle school female students; and develop and distribute analysis tools and codes under open source licenses.<br/><br/>This project explores a new frontier in magneto-optics and magnetic-field-free non-reciprocal light transport based on Dirac materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, where the breaking of inversion symmetry and large spin-orbit coupling lead to valley-spin locking. The intrinsic Berry curvature of these materials further acts as an effective magnetic field in momentum space, which under a valley imbalance can give rise to chiral plasmon modes that enable non-reciprocal light propagation at mid infrared and terahertz frequencies. Valley polarization in these gapped Dirac materials will be induced through three approaches: 1) doping with transition-metal impurities; 2) proximity to layered magnetic transition-metal phosphorous trichalcogenides; and 3) electrical spin injection.  Electromagnetic modeling and calculations of the Berry curvature, magneto optical effects, and chiral plasmons in selected monolayers and heterostructures will provide guidance for material synthesis by molecular beam epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition, and atomic scale characterization with spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and polarization selective photoluminescence, as well as far-field optical characterization and near-field scanning optical microscopy imaging. Through an integrated experimental-theoretical approach, this project aims to demonstrate wave guiding chiral plasmons in the mid-infrared to terahertz range to enable magnetic-field-free optical devices such as non-reciprocal Faraday isolators and tunable optical circulators."

A key challenge for practical implementation of distributed quantum network lies in the technical difficulty in realizing multifunctional integrated quantum photonic circuits that are not only able to perform diverse quantum functionalities, but are also able to share and exchange quantum information between disparate and/or physically separated parts of a network system. <br/>The proposed research aims to address this challenge, by exploring and developing integrated hybrid quantum photonic circuits on the silicon carbide (SiC) platform for high-fidelity and energy-efficient quantum information processing, which interface seamlessly with fiber-optic communication links for secure communication and distribution of quantum information. The ultimate goal is to realize a versatile chip-scale multifunctional integrated hybrid quantum photonic processor with robust operation at room temperature that forms the fundamental building blocks to construct a scalable integrated quantum photonic interconnect. <br/>The proposed research promises a transformative avenue towards integrated quantum photonics that may ultimately transform the complexity and capacity of quantum information processing for secure communication, metrology, sensing, and advanced computing. The proposed research is expected to result in a new class of device technologies with previously inaccessible attributes and merits that may eventually have profound commercial impact on the industrial sectors. The development of SiC photonics may open up a novel avenue for the roadmap of the recently installed American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics). Findings in the fascinating device physics and system integration will generate extraordinary educational materials and inspiration for education of students from K-12 to graduate students.

The approach taken is to construct an active robotic skin, integrating motion, sensing, and decision-making into a single conformable material skin with embedded sensors and actuators, and wrap it around a passive, moldable core material. The skin acts to deform the core, in such a way as to make the robot move, in a manner which is optimized for its surroundings using evolutionary algorithms. In preliminary work, the PI team has demonstrated an initially spherical robot first causing itself to roll, and then morphing to a cylinder and switching to an inchworm-type gait. This project will leverage novel insights from biological systems to derive new operational principles for robots capable of editing their own algorithmic control structure to make use of a changing anatomy, enabling more robust functionality. The results of this research will enable morphing robots that can adjust their morphology to accomplish different tasks or move more efficiently to meet the demands of changing environments or contexts. This project addresses the producing of a transformative tool that can adapt for exploration or discovery of unknown, dangerous, or unpredictable environments. <br/> <br/>Rigid-bodied robots generally excel at specific tasks in structured environments, but lack the versatility and adaptability required to interact-with and locomote-within the natural world. This project will introduce robotic skins that wrap around arbitrary soft bodies to induce the desired motions and deformations. With the addition of robotic skins, passive soft bodies may be turned into active soft robots. Robotic skins integrate actuation, sensing, variable stiffness, and computation into a single conformable material, and may be leveraged to create morphing robots capable of editing their own morphology and control in unstructured and dynamic environments. The objective of the proposed work is to develop and implement an end-to-end procedure that begins with behavior specifications and ends with a physical self-morphing soft robot and its software environment. The approach will employ robotic skins as the foundation of morphing machines by wrapping them around moldable materials (e.g. clay), enabling surface-driven shape change. Robotic skins will mold the underlying body into a desired shape through controlled surface strains, surface pressures and selective stiffening. As the environment or task changes, the skin will re-mold the body into a new shape that is optimized for its context. This approach will leverage novel insights from diverse biological systems to derive new mathematical models, evolutionary algorithms, and multifunctional materials to enable unparalleled contextually-sensitive morphing capabilities for soft robots.<br/><br/>This project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities (EFMA) and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meeting this challenge will require the development of new and innovative renewable production systems that not only help meet the energy and health-product needs of the populace, but do so in a way that is environmentally and economically sustainable. One approach to address the problems of dwindling reserves of non-renewable fuel resources and rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is to capture concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) emerging from waste treatment facilities, petroleum refineries, coal and other energy sources and convert the CO2 into useful products, including dietary supplements, medicinals, and biofuels. Microalgae species represent a potential renewable source of such products due to their ability to use light to fix CO2 into biomolecules. However, there are currently critical technical bottlenecks including slow growth rates and low synthesis rates of desired products and inefficient access to CO2 and light. These limitations will be addressed in an award made by the National Science Foundation Office of Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation, through a collaboration between engineers and scientists Michael Betenbaugh and Royce Francis at Johns Hopkins University, Maciek Antoniewicz at University of Delaware, Steven Miller at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and Bernhard Palsson at University of California, San Diego. They intend to combine genome-scale modeling, metabolic flux analysis, metabolic engineering, and process optimization to improve algae cultivation and capture and convert CO2 and light into useful bioproducts, including carotenoids and hydrocarbons similar to gasoline. Genetic and bioprocess engineering methods will be used to improve pathways involving CO2 capture, carotenoid biosynthesis, and hydrocarbon biosynthesis. Genome-scale models of algal physiology will be connected to bioreactor models in order to optimize commercial-scale production processes and metabolic flux analysis will evaluate the success of these engineering efforts. The investigative team will use life-cycle, economic, and social impact analysis to ensure microalgae bioprocess sustainability.<br/><br/>In order to expand the broader impacts to maximize the educational value, investigators will work closely with Baltimore Poly High School, middle schools, and community colleges to attract, prepare, and retain minority and female students and faculty into STEM fields through various new educational programs. One feature of this effort will be the development of a microalgal demonstration facility for local students and the general public to learn how algae remediate CO2 while generating useful products. These programs will help recruit and train future scientists and engineers in key STEM fields."

Traditional photonics technologies often use a specific material to cover a particular wavelength range, with integration of multiple types 0f photonic materials to cover a broader range highly challenging. This EFRI team will investigate fundamental optical sciences and explore practical photonic applications of a novel two-dimensional (2D) material, black phosphorus (BP), which can cover a broad wavelength range from visible to mid-infrared and can be easily integrated with other photonic platforms due to its layered structure. The team will develop approaches for large-scale black phosphorus synthesis, material characterization, and BP device realization and testing, thus establishing the foundation for black phosphorus based photonic technologies. This project will transform many technological areas relying on optical imaging, sensing and communications, contributing to the National Photonics Initiative (NPI). The team consists of five investigators from four universities (Yale University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Southern California, and Washington University in St. Louis) and covers multiple disciplines including material sciences, physics, and engineering. This EFRI program will also provide students at different levels, especially those from underrepresented groups, and postdocs with multidisciplinary research experience fostered by the EFRI team, as well as through interactions with the industrial and international partners. <br/><br/>This project will leverage recently rediscovered 2D layered black phosphorus to develop novel photonic devices for optical communications and infrared imaging, while exploring its integration with other 2D (e.g. graphene) and bulk (e.g. silicon) materials. In particular, the team will utilize BP?s widely tunable bandgap with layer number and its robust, anisotropic excitons to explore new optical sciences and to transform present photonic technologies. Establishing the theory, synthesis, encapsulation, and characterization approaches of few-layer and thin-film BP, as well as the fabrication and benchmarking of BP photonic device performance will build the foundation of this paradigm shift in photonic devices. Scientifically, exploration of anisotropic excitons and their tunability by electric field in few-layer BP will advance our basic understanding of many body physics in materials with low crystalline symmetry. Technologically, high carrier mobility, direct bandgap and strong light-BP interaction will enable the realization of a number of high performance BP photonics devices especially in strategically critical near- and mid-infrared wavelength range."

Question formulation is an often overlooked yet profoundly important intellectual ability that includes knowing how to produce one's own questions, refine and improve them, and strategize on how to use the questions to guide research. This study will expand upon an evidence-based method, the Question Formulation Technique (QFT) pioneered by the Right Question Institute, to create a rigorous Question Improvement Model (QIM) that will facilitate a more direct path to better research and new discoveries. It is anticipated that the QIM will make an important contribution by providing a key resource for improving doctoral education. The QIM will have broader impacts in three areas. First, the ability to efficiently produce and improve one's research questions should serve as a cornerstone of a strong infrastructure for research and education. In turn, this is likely to lead to beneficial economic outcomes. Finally, the current widespread adoption of the Question Formulation Technique in many fields and diverse communities suggests that the QIM could lead to increased participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM. <br/><br/>The QFT involves sequential steps focusing on divergent thinking, convergent thinking, and metacognitive thinking, and provides a powerful tool for generating novel questions. The QFT has demonstrated efficacy in K-12 settings, but has not been deployed in graduate education. In this study, the QFT will be refined to provide a structured method for generating and improving questions that is suitable for training graduate students in the natural sciences. In the quasi-experimental design of the project, participants in the experimental group will learn to use the Question Improvement Model (QIM) while the remaining participants (the control group) will not initially receive QIM training. All participants will be tested before, during, and over the course of a year for their skill in formulating questions and attitudes about questions. A crossover design will allow the control group participants to receive identical QIM training to the experimental group following assessment. The QIM training may provide a useful complement to existing graduate engineering pedagogy focusing on identifying solutions to predefined questions. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the QIM will be highly scalable and useful in a wide array of disciplines"

A key challenge to develop high-quality 2D STMD materials is the control of these materials with predetermined thickness (number of layers), stacking and composition, and to tailor their optical properties for specific photonics applications. The synthesis strategy of this project is based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which has been proved suitable for synthesizing large-area (cm) 2D crystals of STMD, and for controlling the growth, clustering, doping, alloying and stacking of different STMD. The research team aims to establish a comprehensive first-principles framework for modeling the doping, alloying and stacking of a few layered STMD. The team develops more realistic approaches for the band structure (GW approximation) and excitonic behaviors by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Such studies directly inform material design and CVD synthesis, and enable new photonic applications and devices based on STMD dressed fiber optics, plasmonic nanostructures, and micro-resonators. The research can potentially lead to new paradigms of STMD functionalized optoelectronics, with examples including parity-time symmetric systems for unidirectional invisibility, nonreciprocal light transmission, novel low-power optical switching and photon routing, ultra-low threshold lasers and amplifiers, TMD-plasmonic systems with nonlinear efficiency enhanced up to several orders of magnitude, and high-efficiency nonlinear/quantum optical devices."

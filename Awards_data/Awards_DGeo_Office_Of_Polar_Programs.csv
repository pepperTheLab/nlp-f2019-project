The archive will provide the capability to preserve and enable discovery of all products of NSF Arctic Science Section funded research, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model, using infrastructure from the DataONE federation of data repositories.<br/><br/>This cooperative agreement will support a comprehensive archive of data from Arctic research funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences section, which necessitates a system that can handle the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of data generated in the Arctic. By building upon successful repository infrastructures that already handle these kinds of data the repository will come online at project inception, be immediately useful to researchers, and undergo continuous improvement through feature expansions and refinement. Novel features in the archive will enable critical linkages between data, science, and policy. A data science fellowship program, training workshops, and a short course will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for at least 190 graduate and undergraduate students. Selection will promote underrepresented groups with the goal to increase the diversity of data scientists in the research community. Students returning to their home universities will help communicate data science issues and will effect a large change across science disciplines nationally. In addition, the new infrastructure and data will have a lasting impact on Arctic research and policy globally. Arctic science has policy and societal importance that are disproportionally large, partly because of the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, and partly because of the resource implications on the oil, gas, and other industries that are affected by these changes. Digital research data will serve as a foundation for new insights that impact both science and society.<br/><br/>Data storage will be accomplished utilizing the UC Santa Barbara KNB Data Repository (KNB, formerly the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity) for its versioning and accessioning to enable an effective archive. Data will be replicated to administratively diverse institutions at the KNB, the Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Amazon cloud, as this is critical to long-term preservation. DataONE researcher-facing tools will be adapted to provide convenient pathways to document and archive diverse data formats as part of scientists' normal workflow. This infrastructure will be supported with an outstanding set of community services, including data discovery tools, metadata assessment and editing, data cleansing and integration, data management consulting, and user help-desk services. A data recovery team will engage the community to prioritize and rescue critical Arctic data from past NSF research that is currently inaccessible. In addition to the traditional functions of a data archive, modern cloud-based data facilities will support detailed provenance tracking of the science process, data usage and citation reporting, linkages among heterogeneous disciplines, and direct linkages between the literature, investigators, and funding programs. Usability and outreach specialists will engage an interdisciplinary Arctic Science Advisory Board and the broader polar science communities to drive continuous improvement by evaluating tools and services, gathering requirements and use cases, and prioritizing improvements to infrastructure and service offerings of the archive. Usage data and usability studies will drive an iterative cycle of assessment and development to improve operations."

Indigenous knowledge and perspectives will be combined with scientific knowledge across the biological, geological, geographic, anthropological, and information sciences to enable a comprehensive overview of how different investigators and scholars, from different perspectives and different environments, approach the issues of food security and resilience. One of the key strengths of the RCN is the synergy it will generate between North and South and between Western science and Indigenous scholarship. In addition, the network incorporates insights from information science and data professionals to explore ways to link systems, data and perspectives from multiple domains, both Indigenous and scientific.  The project team intends to increase  sharing and address issues of Indigenous communities concerns over data ownership and access by developing more effective tools for sharing data in cyberspace and on social media. Exploring how to merge ideas from diverse groups will contribute to the advancement of both Convergence science and the co-production of knowledge with Indigenous communities. This award is part of NSF's effort to promote convergence. The project is convergent because it brings together a diversity of disciplines to concentrate on a question of critical social importance.  Social, natural, and information scientists and Indigenous communities will focus on increasing our understanding of the impacts of rapid socioecological change in Indigenous communities from Alaska and the U.S. Southwest on food security and resilience in these communities. The project is convergent not just in how it combines scientific disciplines to address a societal problem, but also in how NSF might fundamentally think about the social construction of the scientific enterprise in the United States.<br/><br/>This RCN has the potential to add a new and fresh perspective to research on food security and resilience through exploration of the rapid social and environmental changes ongoing in the Arctic, by more effectively highlighting Indigenous sources of information. To broaden the perspective and insight into these issues, the RCN will connect Arctic Indigenous communities with tribes in the U.S. Southwest, mainly in Arizona and New Mexico. The RCN has three foci: 1) preservation, visualization, and sharing of Indigenous knowledge; 2) access to scientific data; and 3) Indigenous data sovereignty.  The project will be largely driven and led by Indigenous organizations but will include interdisciplinary Western scientists focused on food security and resilience from both the social and physical sciences to discuss current research agendas, data availability, and encourage the direct engagement of Indigenous partners. One Broader Impact of the RCN is the creation of relationships between Indigenous communities living in different areas but experiencing rapid social and environmental changes. The RCN will also create a plan for preserving and visualizing Indigenous Knowledge and connecting it to scientific data."

The geologic data mainly consist of dated glacial deposits that are preserved above the level of the present ice sheet, and range in age from thousands to millions of years old. These provide information about the size, thickness, and rate of change of the ice sheets during past times when the ice sheets were larger than present. In addition, some of these data are from below the present ice surface and therefore also provide some information about past warm periods when ice sheets were most likely smaller than present. The primary purpose of the computer model is to predict future ice sheet changes, but because significant changes in the size of ice sheets are slow and likely occur over hundreds of years or longer, the only way to determine whether these models are accurate is to test their ability to reproduce past ice sheet changes. The primary purpose of this project is to carry out such a test. The research team will compile relevant geologic data, in some cases generate new data by dating additional deposits, and develop methods and software to compare data to model simulations. In addition, this project will (i) contribute to building and sustaining U.S. science capacity through postdoctoral training in geochronology, ice sheet modeling, and data science, and (ii) improve public access to geologic data and model simulations relevant to ice sheet change through online database and website development. <br/><br/>Technical aspects of this project are primarily focused on the field of cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-dating, which is a method that relies on the production of rare stable and radio-nuclides by cosmic-ray interactions with rocks and minerals exposed at the Earth's surface. Because the advance and retreat of ice sheets results in alternating cosmic-ray exposure and shielding of underlying bedrock and surficial deposits, this technique is commonly used to date and reconstruct past ice sheet changes. First, this project will contribute to compiling and systematizing a large amount of cosmogenic-nuclide exposure age data collected in Antarctica during the past three decades. Second, it will generate additional geochemical data needed to improve the extent and usefulness of measurements of stable cosmogenic nuclides, cosmogenic neon-21 in particular, that are useful for constraining ice-sheet behavior on million-year timescales. Third, it will develop a computational framework for comparison of the geologic data set with existing numerical model simulations of Antarctic ice sheet change during the past several million years, with particular emphasis on model simulations of past warm periods, for example the middle Pliocene ca. 3-3.3 million years ago, during which the Antarctic ice sheets are hypothesized to have been substantially smaller than present. Fourth, guided by the results of this comparison, it will generate new model simulations aimed at improving agreement between model simulations and geologic data, as well as diagnosing which processes or parameterizations in the models are or are not well constrained by the data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Fall offering of this course will continue to be a traditional lecture course. In the Spring course offering, students will work directly with polar data in an introductory R-based programing framework and use these data to evaluate media claims about polar regions. Students will also experience the human dimension of polar research through interactions with a range of polar scientists. Over the course of the project, ~170 non-major students will be immersed in polar science through this data-driven course. The impact of this project will extend well beyond the award period through continued offerings at UD and through development of at least twenty data visualizations and three Problem-Based-Learning (PBL) problems. The course will be delivered three times over three years, with yearly revision based on assessments of student learning, faculty performance, and workshops with a cohort of UD polar scientists and active-learning researchers. They will compare student learning using the active-learning pedagogy to student learning via the traditional lecture course. Results will be disseminated to a broad network of educators and researchers through a collaborative polar science outreach network and through active-learning databases, e.g., PBL Clearinghouse, Science Education Resource Center (SERC), and the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science."

The opening of northern shipping routes, reliability of ice roads for access to coastal communities, and extraction of undersea resources have economic implications for countries around the world.  Indigenous peoples depend on local marine mammal populations as a source of cultural and nutritional value, however Arctic marine mammals are particularly vulnerable to reductions in sea ice cover as have been occurring for more than 30 years.  The presence and extent of Arctic sea ice can also influence the transfer of heat between the ocean and atmosphere, affecting both local and remote seasonal weather patterns.  Sustained observations of Arctic sea ice are therefore crucial for understanding current trends and predicting future changes in the global climate system.  This project will contribute to the National Science Foundation's Arctic Observing Network by developing new techniques for the extraction of sea ice characteristics from a long-running data set collected by an existing network of space weather monitors.<br/><br/>The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is an international network of ground-based space weather radars which have operated continuously in the Arctic and Antarctic regions for more than 30 years.  These high-frequency (HF) radars use over-the-horizon (OTH) radio wave propagation to detect ionospheric plasma structures across ranges of several thousand kilometers.  As a byproduct of this technique, the transmitted radar signals frequently reflect from the Earth?s surface and can be observed as ground backscatter echoes.  This project will analyze historical and ongoing SuperDARN ground backscatter data for extraction of Arctic sea ice parameters, and comparisons will be made to sea ice measurements obtained from space-based microwave remote sensors.  An operational sea ice data product derived from the SuperDARN HF radar observations will be delivered to the National Science Foundation's Arctic Data Center for long-term preservation and accessibility by the broader Arctic research community.  Improvements in the detection and geolocation of SuperDARN ground backscatter echoes will not only benefit future studies of land/sea surface features in radar observations but also increase the quality of global space weather maps of ionospheric plasma convection.  This proposal aligns with one of the National Science Foundation?s 10 Big Ideas for Navigating the New Arctic by leveraging a large data set from an existing observational technology and network. <br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Arctic Sciences section, Office of Polar Programs, the Office of International Science & Engineering and the Geospace section, Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current terms and meanings concerning community-based observing networks, community based monitoring, citizen science, and community observer blogs activities are often used interchangeably. Each, however, constitutes a different type of effort along a CBO continuum. By clearly defining what these activities are and what information they can contribute we can better help communities adapt to changing environmental conditions. The EyesNorth Research Coordinating Network (RCN) will involve a range of practitioners, from Native communities to federal agencies, to develop both a science and practice of CBO that will provide the critical connection between observing change and community preparedness and response. The EyesNorth RCN will coordinate activities around training and education-outreach programs among partners to generate and communicate the best practices for adoption across diverse monitoring activities. <br/><br/> The EyesNorth RCN seeks to develop a science of Community-Based Observing leveraging core theories in resilience and adaptation science. It has four objectives that are co-developed with a range of partners from across the circumpolar North countries including Canada, Russia, the United States, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Greenland. The network objective will achieve coordination across activities and organizations currently utilizing CBO for monitoring socio-environmental change in the Arctic and Subarctic. It will create a diverse, transdisciplinary network of users, scientists, and practitioners. The science objective will advance theory to build a science of CBO by developing new and refining existing theoretical connections among disciplines that drive the science of CBO in order to expand and enhance the transferability of adaptation actions by communities on the ground. The sustainability objective will define best practices across the CBO continuum including international data sharing protocols and protections that ensure Indigenous Knowledge and Local Place Based Knowledge are appropriately applied and determined by communities themselves. The education and training objective will ensure that best practices are co-developed rather than imposed and, through partnerships with communities from the Western United States, we will ensure transferability of lessons learned. These partnerships will: a) co-define a range of technology-enabled approaches that enable linked, scalable, and usable data for a range of end-users that will help inform management decisions whose actions affect the resilience of local communities ? where ?data? refers to the breadth of information about the world we live in; and b) transfer these approaches to produce practices that can be applied nationally and internationally. We will develop data and metadata standards necessary to facilitate the sharing of knowledge between researchers and communities which can serve as baselines for future CBO programs while also expanding the scope of current efforts so as to transfer and implement CBO in diverse communities and settings in the Western U.S. We engage with Industry, research and resource management practitioners about the types of data acquisition technologies most amenable to different types of CBO. Ultimately, the EyesNorth RCN will coalesce, for the first time, a broad range of CBO practitioners to design and leverage collaborative and equitable training and education activities with partners in the Arctic and Western U.S. yielding a science of CBO that can enhance the well-being and quality of life for all Americans."

Changes in the Arctic in particular have implications for the prosperity, welfare, health, and national security of the United States and all nations. Understanding, adapting to, and possibly benefiting from these changes requires that scientists, governments, Arctic residents, and society as a whole work together to enhance understanding and generate action at scales from local to international. In support of understanding and action, the importance of polar data and its proper management are increasingly being recognized by governments, the science community, and society. The Polar Data Planning Summit will bring together key actors from around the world to contribute to the design and implementation of and integrated and well-defined polar network that enable access to high- quality data, expertise, and information. This will place the United States in a leadership role in developing a data network that will support enhanced scientific understanding, national security, meeting stakeholder needs, and improved agency operations.<br/><br/>The Polar Data Planning Summit will host more than twenty representatives from key polar data programs and projects from around the world. An international steering committee will work with the local organizing committee to establish and agenda that prioritizes concrete work planning and particularly the coordination of various activities being carried out under different projects. The result will be a collectively developed road map outlining a world-wide system that will provide researchers, Arctic residents, decision makers and others with access to the vast majority of polar data. This will include a coordinated, integrated work plan identifying goals, objectives, and associated existing and emerging funded projects and programs. The outcomes of the Summit will be disseminated at major meetings such as the POLAR 2018/Arctic Observing Summit 2018 meetings in Davos, Switzerland, and the next Arctic Science Ministerial expected in the Fall of 2018."

Onset of seasonal ice melt is occurring earlier in the year with a later date of fall freeze up.  There has been a dramatic reduction in the lateral extent, thickness and age of the sea ice cover.  Significant freshening of surface waters has been observed along with warming in several subsurface layers.  Additional ocean heat contributes to additional sea ice melting.  All of these changes have consequences for the polar ecosystem, earth's climate state and the resilience of near-shore native communities, as well as impact on human use of the high northern latitudes including commercial shipping, natural resource extraction, ecotourism and the accompanying search, rescue and defense activities.  Historically, the ice-covered Arctic Ocean has been poorly observed, particularly in winter.  The Ice-Tethered Profiler instrument (ITP), developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2003-4, is designed to sample the upper Arctic Ocean water properties and sea ice motion in all seasons and transmit those data to shore-side users in real time. The system consists of a surface buoy typically deployed on an ice floe that supports a wire rope tether extending through the ice down to around 800 m depth, and an underwater vehicle that repeatedly crawls up and down the tether carrying sensors that sample sea water properties such as temperature and salinity.  To date, approximately 100 ITP systems have been deployed in the Arctic (each operating for 1-3 years) that have collectively returned more than 70,000 observations of Arctic Ocean water properties as well as nearly 150 cumulative years of ice drift data, all contributing to the National Science Foundation's Arctic Observing Network program.  These data have been used by researchers and students (so far resulting in approximately 150 published peer-reviewed papers that have directly utilized ITP data, cited research based on ITP observations or otherwise referenced the ITP program) as well as operational agencies the world over.  The present research project will continue this activity for a 5-year period as sustained observations are considered vital to documenting and understanding the rapid changes now underway in the Arctic and predicting its future evolution. A three-pronged effort is planned that consists of 1) annual deployment of conventional ITPs, 2) development, testing and then operational deployments of a new instrument, the Tethered Ocean Profiler (TOP) that focuses on the upper 100 200 m of the water column, and 3) scientific analysis of the resulting ITP and TOP data.  Initial focus of the latter will be the Arctic surface waters and their interaction with the sea ice.  As in the past, data from these autonomous instruments will be publicly distributed via the project website, the Global Telecommunications System network, the Arctic Data Center and the National Center for Environmental Information.  Beyond science and engineering, the new project will enhance the ITP website and develop a display for the WHOI Exhibition Center to provide the public with a broader understanding of the research and the exciting engineering now underway, along with the reasons to gather Arctic information during this time of dramatic change.<br/><br/>Technically, the new award will support continuation of the WHOI Ice-Tethered Profiler project with similar scope and activity as in recent years.  Four standard ITP systems will be built and fielded in each of the first 4 years of the project with real time data recovery, automated processing and distribution.  The real-time data from each ITP system will consist of daily (or more frequent) vertical profiles of ocean temperature and salinity at 2-m resolution (as well as the raw data) and hourly or better buoy position fixes from which ice velocity may be derived. Also, as in the past, the recovered data will be edited, calibrated and gridded, with these science-quality products being made publicly available as soon as they are completed.  The new Tethered Ocean Profiler development activity will contribute 2 operational TOP systems annually. TOP data handling and distribution will parallel the ITP protocol. Deployments of ITP and TOP buoys will be decided annually in light of available expeditions with the goal (in collaboration with other buoy programs) of sustaining broad spatial coverage of the deep Arctic. Beyond continuing the present data handling, the new project will create and maintain a data base of individual ITP profiles archived by position and time, and develop and support a utilities toolbox to facilitate exploration and analysis of these observations by students/postdocs, fellow scientists, and computer-savvy members of the general public. The envisioned data base will hold individual profile data in netCDF format together with functions written in both Matlab and Python to extract and present data subsets to the user as specified. The archive will be accessible from the ITP program website as well as offered to the national data centers for archival. The initial science topic that will be investigated will focus on the Arctic Ocean surface mixed layer, using a combined dataset from ITPs and manned stations to document mixed layer thickness (using a variety of criteria), temperature and salinity in Arctic geographic subdomains versus time. In turn, these characteristics (and any trends with time) will be assessed relative to surface forcing (air-sea exchange of heat and momentum, sea ice growth and melt) through direct correlation and simple models. Focus will be the period from 2000 to present. Analysis of these new observations by the project Principal Investigators and others will contribute to a better understanding of the extreme changes taking place in the Arctic Ocean and their impacts on earth's climate, the polar ecosystem and human activities in the far north.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evidence from Arctic and North Atlantic historical and literary sources and archaeological sites reveals frequent use of marine mammals by prehistoric hunters and scavengers and Norse settlers, but details about the uses of whale, seal, and walrus are unquantified, broad and approximate. These northern regions are critically important ecosystems to current North American economies and interests.  They were home to the world's earliest whaling industries and support ongoing sealing and whaling traditions.  However, we know almost nothing about the origins and scale of whale, seal, and walrus use in these once fertile waters. Given the complexity of marine food webs in regions like the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, reconstruction of preindustrial or 'pristine' maritime ecosystems is critical in modern restoration efforts and for the preservation and sustainable use of fish and mammal populations today. Without clear knowledge of ancient and early historic marine mammal populations, we cannot gauge what healthy marine mammal populations would look like today.<br/><br/>The fourteen-member research team, from the disciplines of humanities, history, archaeology, biology, genetics and others, aims to investigate the deep history of whale, seal, and walrus use in the Eastern Arctic and North Atlantic. This research will span the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age (beginning around 800 CE), through the Medieval Warm Period (circa 1000-1250), and concluding with the Little Ice Age at the end of the Middle Ages (1300-1500). In addition to assessing the social, cultural, and economic importance of marine mammal use among Norse populations, the research study uses cutting-edge genetic and chemical analyses to provide a far better understanding of marine mammal populations in the Arctic and North Atlantic before the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting beginning in the sixteenth century. Evidence from houses, burials, and trading sites, from current archaeological excavations and museum collections, as well as histories, sagas, maps, illuminated manuscripts and other traditional sources of knowledge, are combined with scientific approaches to ancient animal bones and the genetic stories that they can tell. This project will build interdisciplinary connections across the social and natural sciences, will bring together researchers and students from six countries and eleven academic institutions and museums, and will employ the most current technologies and scholarship in genetics, biology, digital humanities, and zooarchaeology. The research team hopes to uncover new evidence about the marine animals that populated medieval seas, and the manners in which medieval Icelanders, Greenlanders, and others encountered and exploited these mammals. The project team will produce scholarly articles, translations, new genetic and zooarchaeological data sets, will participate in academic conferences and public presentations, and will design both curricular and museum materials to communicate our results to a broader audience. Undergraduate and graduate students will be guided through transdisciplinary research collaborations in the US and abroad. Finally, the team scientists think that their results may also aid colleagues in the natural sciences in reconstruction of ancient seas, climates, animal populations, and environmental change, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability.<br/><br/><br/>This project seeks answers to fundamental questions about medieval marine mammal exploitation, focusing on Norse uses of whales, seals and walruses in the North Atlantic prior to 1500 CE. In a region dominated by charismatic Arctic megafauna, where modern industrial whaling was born and where current whaling and sealing attract global attention, the prehistory and early history of marine mammal use remain unclear in its scale and purpose. The researchers' transdisciplinary approach employs Local and Traditional Knowledge (LTK), digital humanities, environmental histories, and innovative technologies of genetic analysis to new and existing sea mammal archaeofaunal assemblages to produce a holistic long-term perspective on the social, cultural, and economic history of marine mammal use in medieval northern Europe. This research spans the first settlements of the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland in the Viking Age and the Medieval Climatic Optimum, through the Little Ice Age onset in the high Middle Ages and Early Modern periods. The length of the project survey period (+ 700 years) will result in samples across a broad range of time and space, which allows the science team to contextualize newly-generated aDNA marine mammal data across several documented periods of major climate change in the North Atlantic and Subarctic.<br/><br/>The project will also provide a far better understanding of marine mammal dynamics in these regions prior to the major changes resulting from industrial-scale hunting impacts beginning in the sixteenth century. The project utilizes: 1) a new integration with the rich medieval written record for Iceland aided by digital and environmental humanities approaches; 2) a greatly expanded zooarchaeological database created since the International Polar Year (IPY) by the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) research cooperative; 3) newly expanded capabilities in ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, allowing species-level identification on a wide range of otherwise unidentifiable sea mammal bones; 4) new data management and visualization tools providing more effective cross disciplinary communication and wider public engagement through cooperation with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NISDC) and NABO project management system; and 5) facilities for wide transdisciplinary dissemination of results through the Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (IHOPE) program as part of the Future Earth global change initiative. This project will build capacity for scientific collaboration and data management, dissemination, and visualization, while improving species-level identification, exceeding current capabilities of simple morphometric analysis or collagen fingerprinting of sea mammal bones from archaeological contexts and museum collections. In addition, it offers the promise to create important new bodies of evidence for a range of scholarly disciplines across a broad temporal and geographical series of case studies.<br/><br/>Finally, the proposed project's use of extant data sets - textual, archaeological, biological  - may provide an innovative new model for transdisciplinary analysis of premodern marine mammal use that can be applied across the North Atlantic and circumpolar Arctic. The researchers hope to establish a historical baseline of marine mammal use that reveals a more complete economic and ecological portrait of the Norse North Atlantic. Through collaborations with North Pacific and Western Arctic colleagues, the research team's work will complete a circumpolar perspective of prehistoric and early historic marine mammal exploitation. By answering fundamental questions of marine mammal use, this research has the potential to provide context or evidence for lost genetic diversity among key marine species, now under pressure from both natural and human drivers of environmental change. This integrative approach, including collaboration of scholars and students from twelve institutions across North America and Europe, also provides new models and innovative methodologies for transdisciplinary research in the social sciences and humanities, with direct application to major issues of future sustainability."

The project will answer questions about the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf in future climate, and the geotectonic evolution of the Ross Ice Shelf Region, a key component of the West Antarctic Rift system. The comprehensive benchmark data sets acquired will enable broad, interdisciplinary analyses and modeling, which will also be performed as part of the project. ROSETTA-ICE will illuminate Ross ice sheet-ice shelf-ocean dynamics as the system nears a critical juncture but still is intact. Through interacting with an online data visualization tool, and comparing the ROSETTA-ICE data and results from earlier studies, we will engage students and young investigators, equipping them with new capabilities for the study of critical earth systems that influence global climate."

Paleoclimate data provide our only empirical observations of how the arctic system responds to major sustained climate change. It is especially urgent to understand how past climate change unfolded on Greenland, because mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet will drive a large fraction of future sea level rise. Existing data from south Greenland hint that climate trends there may differ from trends observed elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere on a range of timescales, with potential consequences for future temperature change and thus for ice sheet mass balance. The proposed research will assess the apparent divergence through the Holocene (the last 11,000 years), by developing a suite of climate reconstructions from lakes in southernmost Greenland. <br/><br/>Climate records to be generated include quantitative temperature reconstructions based on insect (chironomid) assemblages and reconstructions of precipitation isotopes (reflecting changes in atmospheric circulation) using an emerging method based on chironomid oxygen-18. A third approach -- reconstructions of alpine glacier fluctuations using sediments from glacial threshold lakes -- will constrain local ice mass balance and help to further characterize local atmospheric climate through the Holocene, especially its influence on the ice sheet. This work would double the number of continuous, quantitative Holocene terrestrial temperature reconstructions available from Greenland beyond the ice sheet, thus contributing to community-wide efforts to understand how the arctic system responds to sustained climate change. Data will be incorporated into paleodata syntheses, in keeping with the PI's track record of participation in such efforts, and will allow for better tests of climate and ice sheet models. Independent reconstructions of Holocene precipitation isotopes will be used to assess whether changes in atmospheric circulation accompanied past climate change, and thus might accompany future climate change. By constraining summer temperatures and local glacier mass balance, and comparing results with glacial geologic studies, this work will help clarify the role of atmospheric climate at the ice sheet margin in driving ice sheet changes. This work will also advance two methods: It will validate and apply an emerging isotopic proxy with potential for widespread application, and the PI will lead international collaborative development of a new calibration dataset for the chironomid paleothermometer. This grant will train at least two Ph.D. students and at least five undergraduates in international polar research, and will advance the professional development of a pre-tenure geoscientist who has a demonstrated commitment to the broader impacts of her research. Multiple collaborations, including with glacial geologists and paleoecologists at five foreign institutions, will be advanced. A new seminar will train graduate students in sustainability-relevant STEM fields in skills for communicating science beyond academia, contributing to broad training of the future STEM workforce. This project will provide sustained professional development for K-12 teachers, who in turn will bring climate and energy science to Chicago-area classrooms, promoting innovative STEM education for students in one of the largest U.S. urban school districts (Chicago's District 299)."

The research community finds itself in the midst of a scientific and geospatial revolution sparked by the availability of an unprecedented volume of open geospatial data, as well as access to high-resolution optical imagery made available by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In support of NSF?s Polar science mission of understanding the earth and its systems, exploring the geographical frontier, and performing science enabled by in polar setting, PGC uses these data to provide mapping, GIS, and remote sensing solutions to researchers and logistics groups. PGC provides products and services including: mapping and GIS analysis; access to sub-meter commercial satellite imagery for the Antarctic and Arctic; expertise to task, manage, process and deliver high-level value-added products to the NSF polar community; domain and institutional knowledge to solve a broad range of geospatial problems; and educational courses including online material to transfer PGC?s knowledge and experience to the community. The PGC is collaborating with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to create a publicly available high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the entire Arctic from high-resolution satellite imagery. These data will be used by the Arctic community to support activities including transportation, national defense, land management, sustainable development, and scientific studies.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/>The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) facilitates access to geospatial resources and knowledge for the polar community. PGC staff has a direct one-to-one relationship with each user, tailoring product delivery to the expertise and needs of the user?s specific science or logistics goals. To this end, PGC maintains an extensive online archive of sub-meter electro-optical commercial imagery licensed through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency?s (NGA) EnhancedView program.  PGC works to automate labor-intensive processing workflows using the Extreme Science and Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and Blue Waters high performance computing infrastructures, and is developing a web-based imagery and geospatial product delivery system (FRIDGE; Federal Research Imagery Download and Geodata Exploration). This delivery system is based around a task management and queuing tool that interfaces with PGC?s user management database and PGC?s HPC cluster. Polar digital elevation models (DEM) will be produced using the Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) algorithm and the Ames Stereo Pipeline. These products have an expected accuracy of 4m without ground control and sub-meter accuracy when ground control is used. A key component of PGC's mission is training of today's young geospatial students in the use of imagery to solve scientific problems. PGC offers workshops, online instructional material, and collaborative imagery processing workflow development.  PGC?s goal is to provide rapid and cost-effective access to geospatial data and education for the purpose of promoting polar science."

In order to address urgent challenges and needs in both student training and global-change science, the overarching goal of this project is to train students at this Hispanic-serving institution to be leading data professionals capable in cross-disciplinary collaboration, team science, and scientific communication. The program will center on the infusion of quantitative skills development in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) spanning an undergraduate curriculum that addresses data intensive challenges in Arctic ecosystem ecology. Using legacy and recent Arctic data resources for the Barrow area in northernmost Alaska, together with field experiences and lab-based manipulations, the PIs will orchestrate authentic, collaborative research experiences, where students will develop research questions, collect, analyze, and synthesize data, and communicate results in scientifically valid venues on topics that have yet to be investigated. This proposal builds on the PIs prior success with both International Polar Year funding for a program that took underserved students to Antarctica (PLR 0632360), funding for undergraduate cyberinfrastructure training (DUE 0733055), and funding for a GK-12 program (DGE 0947993).  <br/><br/>A series of novel and vertically integrated CUREs will be designed that are: i) implemented in both lower and upper-division courses; b) focused in the area of data-intensive ecosystem ecology; and c) constructed in a manner intended to enhance students' cognitive and non-cognitive attributes. Arctic ecologists and a specialist in education research will collaborate to design the CUREs and complete a formal evaluation of the educational impact of the proposed activities. Tutorials implemented across the curriculum, as well as web-based resources, will facilitate skills development and transfer of knowledge and data.  <br/><br/>Nearly 200 students will be impacted directly by this program, which will serve to reinforce a pipeline of students, especially Hispanic students, into UTEP graduate programs. Existing archived Arctic data resources will be applied in a training environment; new complementary data will be collected, integrated, analyzed, published and archived using standardized format and best practice. Through contributions to CUREnet and other online media, the PIs will also support adoption by other institutions. Presentations of results will occur at local to national scales and be published in peer-reviewed journals, and additional outreach activities in El Paso and Barrow will also impact high school and community college students."

The ULVZs are so named because seismic waves passing through the Earth slow down dramatically when they encounter these zones. While ULVZs are thought to be related to melting processes, there is growing controversy regarding their origin and the role they play in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. The ULVZs may include the largest magma chambers in Earth's interior. Currently, researchers have only searched 40% of Earth's core-mantle boundary for the ULVZs and this project would use existing seismic data to map an unexplored area under Antarctica and interpret the nature of the ULVZs. This project will support two graduate students and create opportunities for undergraduate involvement.   Project results will be published in scientific journals, presented at science fairs, and communicated through the researchers' websites. The research team will also take part in the NSF-sponsored PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) program to communicate the science to students and the broader community.  <br/><br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>The National Research Council has highlighted high-resolution imaging of core-mantle boundary (CMB) structure as a high-priority, emerging research opportunity in the Earth Sciences since anomalies along the CMB likely play a critical role in the thermal and chemical evolution of our planet. Of particular interest are ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs), thin laterally-varying boundary layers associated with dramatic seismic velocity decreases and increases in density that are seen just above the CMB.  Many questions exist regarding the origin of ULVZs, but incomplete seismic sampling of the lowermost mantle has limited our ability to map global ULVZ structure in detail.  Using recently collected data from the Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network (TAMNNET) in Antarctica, this project will use core-reflected seismic phases (ScP, PcP, and ScS) to investigate ULVZ presence/absence along previously unexplored sections of the CMB.  The data sampling includes the southern boundary of the Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP), a dominant feature in global shear wave tomography models, and will allow the researchers to examine a possible connection between ULVZs and LLSVPs. The main objectives of the project are to: 1) use TAMNNET data to document ULVZ presence/absence in previously unexplored regions of the lowermost mantle with array-based approaches; 2) model the data with 1- and 2.5-D wave propagation tools to obtain ULVZ properties and to assess trade-offs among the models; 3) use high quality events to augment the densely-spaced TAMNNET data with that from the more geographically-distributed, open-access Antarctic stations to increase CMB coverage with single-station analyses; and 4) explore the implications of ULVZ solution models for origin, present-day dynamics, and evolution, including their connection to other deep mantle structures, like LLSVPs.<br/><br/>The project aims to provide new constraints on ULVZs, including their potential connection to LLSVPs, and thus relates to other seismic and geodynamic investigations focused on processes within the Earth?s interior. This project will promote a new research collaboration between The University of Alabama (UA) and Arizona State University (ASU), each of which brings specific strengths to the initiative."

Recent increases in ice loss are attributed to changes in snowfall and melt water processes occurring over the surface of the ice sheets, termed surface mass balance (SMB) processes.  This project enables the generation of new scientific knowledge regarding the state and fate of the Arctic environment by providing researchers access to an aggregated dataset of SMB measurements over both land ice in Greenland and Arctic sea ice.  This dataset will enable better predictions of sea level rise and Arctic sea ice loss by validating models, improving remote sensing algorithms and providing a single dataset with field measurements for broad use within the polar science community.  This project supports education by employing and training a student at the University of Colorado to understand SMB processes and methods for using measurements to constrain model predictions of Greenland ice mass loss. This project will support broad public education by contributing to the National Snow and Ice Data Center?s Greenland Today blog posts that update the public on the current changes occurring over the Greenland ice sheet. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to construct an aggregate dataset of field measurements that are consistent in format, properly described, and can easily be used to  assess Greenland?s ice sheet mass balance.  Without a common, usable, centralized dataset, important research is slowed down by unnecessary data discovery, access, and manipulation work currently being repeated by many different researchers around the country and internationally. Better prediction of sea level rise should not be hindered by this inefficient process. This research addresses the Polar Cyberinfrastructure?s call for longterm sustainable curatorship, standardization, management and discovery of data, and metadata and access and interoperability of data across scientific disciplines.  This research seeks to answer and meet the following Scientific Questions and Cyberinfrastructure Objectives: Science Question 1.  What is the current spatial and temporal resolution of existing measurements and how well can they constrain SMB model outputs?; Science Question 2. Where and what type of SMB measurements are needed to monitor  and further constrain SMB estimates into the future?; Cyber Objective 1. To ingest measurements quickly into an aggregated, standard dataset for use by the Polar Science community; Cyber Objective 2. To create data protocols and community guidelines to expand the utility of specific geophysical measurements necessary to constrain SMB models  and develop remote sensing algorithms."

Atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake into sea water, moderated by the time-varying amount of sea ice cover, causes acidification of Arctic Ocean waters with potentially important impacts on the marine ecosystem. One expects that the atmosphere and its chemistry will respond in a complex manner to sea ice change and Arctic warming, but the science community lacks the ability to make predictions with confidence given only basic mechanistic understanding of the relevant processes. The O-Buoy Chemical Network project was funded under an Arctic Observing Network grant to observe atmospheric chemicals, meteorology, and sea-ice properties that can improve our understanding of the relevant processes and thus improve predictability of scenarios of future climate. That project has deployed fifteen autonomous buoys measuring three sentinel atmospheric chemical species, each for roughly a year?s time, spread across the Arctic Ocean, providing detailed, high-time-resolution data relevant to understanding the Arctic atmosphere?s chemistry in relation to sea ice. In this project, the science team will synthesize, interpret, and generate fundamental understanding from the O-Buoy network data. In addition, GEOS-Chem modeling combined with the O-Buoy measurements will be used to develop a region wide understanding of the relationship between the Arctic atmosphere and sea ice.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM manpower development in a number of ways.  It will provide support for an early career scientist during the formative years of his career.  It will support the training of three Ph.D. students and engage multiple undergraduate students.  Efforts will be made to draw these latter students from groups under-represented in the STEM fields by leveraging the resources of the Dartmouth College Women in Science Program (WISP) and the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska.  Outreach to the K - gray community will be enabled through leveraging of existing programs such as the NSF-funded Next Generation WeatherBlur Project, the US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory's summer science camp for New Hampshire middle school students, the University of Alaska's annual Spring Science Potpourri open house, the weekly Caf Scientifique in Boothbay Harbor, Maine: a summer lecture series that promotes public engagement with cutting-edge scientific research, and the extensive web presence of the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.  <br/><br/>The Arctic Ocean's overlying atmosphere is characterized by production of reactive halogen oxidizers from sea salts that lead to depletion of ground-level ozone and deposition of mercury.  This production is believed to be modulated by the state of the sea ice cover.  This project will answer three specific science questions relevant to the overarching question ""How do changes in the Arctic Ocean environment, especially sea ice, affect the atmosphere?"" via statistical analysis and modeling approaches.  Statistical methods will test and improve process understanding while modeling approaches will be used to improve quantification of gas exchange fluxes with the Arctic Ocean through the fractured, drifting, sea ice and to predict fluxes of reactive halogen oxidizers and their precursors from sea ice.

These moorings measure (hourly, year-round) water velocity, water temperature and salinity, and the thickness and motion of the seasonal sea ice in the region. The installations are available also to support instrumentation from other studies, e.g., marine mammal research.  The project will provide data products of oceanic fluxes and water properties at various timescales (including hourly, monthly, and annual), interacting with stakeholders to provide the most relevant products.  Combining these data with satellite data sets, modeling results, and indigenous knowledge, the researchers will quantify long-term change and the changing drivers of the properties of the inflow.  The project also trains students in oceanographic techniques; brings western science to the classroom through a ?5-year journey in science? outreach project to native communities in Alaska and Hispanic/Latino-dominated schools in Seattle; and connects the Arctic and the public through university classes, various public talks, and the annual Polar Science Weekend at Seattle?s major Science museum.  <br/>Part B: The Pacific inflow to the Arctic Ocean (which is via the Bering Strait) is critical to the oceanic systems of the Alaskan seas and western Arctic Ocean.  Recent years are showing dramatic increase and early warming in this inflow.  This has consequences regionally, in the Arctic, and (models suggest) also globally.  Consider some examples.  The inflow impacts nutrient supply to the nationally crucial Bering Sea, source of ~ 50% of the US fish catch.  Heat carried by the inflow (increasing in recent years) is a trigger of early Arctic sea-ice retreat.  Water properties of the inflow control how the ocean interacts with sea ice over roughly half the Arctic Ocean.  Nutrients carried by the inflow feed Arctic ecosystems, both in the Arctic Ocean and in the US and Canadian northern coastal regions.  It is thus vital to assess the changing Pacific inflow to the Arctic - for local native communities; for the new focus on pan-Arctic access, global shipping and resource exploitation; and for understanding (and predicting) how the Arctic is changing and the impacts of that change.  To date, the only effective way of making this assessment is through year-round in-water measurements.  The US started such measurements in 1990, allowing us now to quantify in context the remarkable transitions currently in progress.  This new research will continue these measurements to 2022, also seeking understanding of the drivers of recent change.  Crucially, the work will provide oceanic information in useful forms to the many stakeholders, including local and global science, local native communities, the public, and industry (e.g., oil/gas exploration, shipping, tourism).  Internationally, the project is a substantial US contribution to global cooperation in the Arctic.  Educationally, the project brings science and the Arctic to school and public communities, including role modeling success of diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core team of researchers and engineers maintain the existing ICNO infrastructure at the South Pole and home institution, guaranteeing an uninterrupted stream of scientifically unique, high-quality data. The M&O activities are built upon eight highly successful years of managing the overall ICNO operations after the start of science operations in 2008. Construction of ICNO was supported by NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account and was completed on schedule and within budget in 2010. Effective coordination of efforts by the core M&O personnel and efforts by personnel within the IceCube Collaboration has yielded significant increases in the performance of this cubic-kilometer detector over time. The scientific output from the IceCube Collaboration during the past five years has been outstanding. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the ICNO/M&O activities are strong, involving postdoctoral, graduate, and (in some cases) undergraduate students in the day-today operation & calibration of the neutrino detector. The extraordinary physics results recently produced by ICNO and its extraordinary location at South Pole have a high potential to excite the imagination of high school children and the public in general at a national and international level.<br/><br/>The current ICNO/M&O effort produces better energy and angular resolution information about detected neutrino events, has more efficient data filters and more accurate detector simulations, and enables continuous software development for systems that are needed to acquire and analyze data. This has produced data acquisition and data management systems with high robustness, traceability, and maintainability. The current ICNO/M&O effort includes: (1) resources for both distributed and centrally managed activities, and (2) additional accountability mechanisms for ""in-kind"" and institutional contributions. Both are necessary to ensure that the detector maintains its capability to produce quality scientific data at the level required to achieve the detector's scientific discovery objectives. Recent ICNO discoveries of cosmic high-energy neutrinos (some reaching energies close to and over 2.5 PeV) and oscillating atmospheric neutrinos in a previously unexplored energy range from 10 to 60 GeV became possible because of the ""state-of-the-art"" detector configuration, excellently supported infrastructure, and cutting-edge science analyses. The ICNO has set limits on Dark Matter annihilations, made precision measurements of the angular distribution of cosmic ray muons, and characterized in detail physical properties of the Antarctic 2.5-km thick ice sheet at South Pole. The discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by IceCube with a flux at the level anticipated for those associated with high-energy gamma- and cosmic-ray accelerators brightens the prospect for identifying the sources of the highest energy particles."

Such predictions are hampered by a poor understanding of processes occurring at the face of glaciers that terminate in the marine waters of fjords.  Data collection in such locales is difficult and dangerous, because the glaciers are intermittently calving icebergs.  Using other funding, the scientists involved in this project have collected two unique data sets from near a glacier face in Greenland and propose to analyze these data.  A successful and insightful project will transform the manner in which we model and observe these regions.  <br/><br/>This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of oceanographers, glaciologists and engineers, including a graduate student and a post-doctoral associate who will benefit from exposure to the diverse methods to be used in this interdisciplinary science project.

The data, collected over two summer seasons (one with exceptional melt) using private funds, include unique measurements within 100 m of the ice front taken from two autonomous vehicles (one surface and one underwater) and moorings deployed by helicopter. Ocean property and velocity data will be used to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of the near-ice dynamics and will be compared with existing theories. This analysis will be complemented by glaciological, meteorological and climate model data to constrain the frontal position, catchment size, glacier velocity, surface meltwater production and runoff. A key objective is to characterize the parameter regime in order to constrain future modeling. A second objective is to evaluate and provide feedback on the use of new technology to overcome the challenges of observations in this region, a requirement for future oceanographic and glaciological investigations."

One way to better understand the past history of the ice sheets is to obtain records from inland ice for past geological periods, particularly in Antarctica, the world?s largest remaining ice sheet. Such records are exceedingly rare, and can be acquired at volcanic outcrops in the La Gorce Mountains of the central Transantarctic Mountains.  Volcanoes now exposed within the La Gorce Mountains erupted beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet and the data collected will record how thick the ice sheet was in the past.  In addition, information will be used to determine the thermal conditions at the base of the ice sheet, which impacts ice sheet stability. The project will also investigate the origin of volcanic activity in Antarctica and links to the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS).  The WARS is a broad area of extended (i.e. stretched) continental crust, similar to that found in East Africa, and volcanism is wide spread and long-lived (65 million years to currently active) and despite more than 50 years of research, the fundamental cause of volcanism and rifting in Antarctica is still vigorously debated. The results of this award therefore also potentially impact the study of oceanic volcanism in the entire southwestern Pacific region (e.g., New Zealand and Australia), where volcanic fields of similar composition and age have been linked by common magma sources and processes. The field program includes a graduate student who will work on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of petrological data as part of his/her Masters project. The experience and specialized analytical training being offered will improve the quality of the student?s research and optimize their opportunities for their future. The proposed work fosters faculty and student national and international collaboration, including working with multi-user facilities that provide advanced technological mentoring of science students. Results will be broadly disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, public presentations at science meetings, and in outreach activities. Petrologic and geochemical data will be disseminated to be the community through the Polar Rock Repository.<br/><br/>The study of subglacially erupted volcanic rocks has been developed to the extent that it is now the most powerful proxy methodology for establishing precise ?snapshots? of ice sheets, including multiple critical ice parameters. Such data should include measurements of ice thickness, surface elevation and stability, which will be used to verify, or reject,  published semi-empirical models relating ice dynamics to sea level changes. In addition to establishing whether East Antarctic ice was present during the formation of the volcanoes, data will be used to derive the coeval ice thicknesses, surface elevations and basal thermal regime(s) in concert with a precise new geochronology using the 40Ar/39Ar dating method. Inferences from measurement of standard geochemical characteristics (major, trace elements and Sr, Nd, Pb, O isotopes) will be used to investigate a possible relationship between the volcanoes and the recently discovered subglacial ridge under the East Antarctic ice, which may be a rift flank uplift. The ridge has never been sampled, is undated and its significance is uncertain.  The data will provide important new information about the deep Earth and geodynamic processes beneath this mostly ice covered and poorly understood sector of the Antarctic continent."

MOSAiC will use intensive scientific observations from a year-long drifting station in the central Arctic to improve understanding of atmosphere-ice-ocean processes and enable significantly better models of the Arctic system and its sea ice.  MOSAiC participants from the US and more than 15 nations will work collaboratively to achieve a collection of related science objectives.  Such a large-scale scientific endeavor requires a MOSAiC Coordination Office (MCO) that coordinates the significant US contribution to MOSAiC from the National Science Foundation and other US agencies (collectively the second largest national contribution) and works jointly with German partners to provide international leadership for the overall effort. This office builds on, and formalizes, a co-leadership team between the Alfred Wegener Institute and University of Colorado that over the past nine years has jointly worked to conceive MOSAiC, develop international support and participation, secure substantial resources, and oversee the writing of MOSAiC Science and Implementation plans. Due to the overall size, scope, and complexity of MOSAiC, this dedicated coordination is essential to achieve two specific goals: to maximize the 1) scientific and 2) societal impacts of MOSAiC. The MCO provides a framework for effective scientific coordination, leadership, and communication across all MOSAiC activities using web-based tools, scientific workshops, modern multimedia content, and dedicated outreach and education activities.<br/><br/>MOSAiC is a high profile international expedition developed in collaboration with the modeling community to directly target many Arctic system processes that are still uncertain, and in most need of improvement, in coupled models. This once-in-a-generation project provides coupled-system observations, over a continuous annual cycle and over a model grid-box scale, that are uniquely positioned to build a foundation of process-level understanding for developing models that represent and predict the changing Arctic system. The MCO plays a vital role in coordinating and leveraging distinctly funded and narrowly focused science contributions towards achieving the complex, interdisciplinary, coupled system science objectives of MOSAiC. Coordination ensures the most effective use of resources and helps maximize the amount of research that is possible given limited resources. Towards advancing science, the MCO oversees the joint documentation of MOSAiC data and facilitates the development of coupled and synthesis data products that will have a lasting impact on the research community and other national and international stakeholders. The MCO also provides a framework and products to ensure significant societal impact through outreach and education efforts, and regular, effective media communication, beyond what is possible from individually funded science projects. Modern multimedia content is produced to support the development and dissemination of engaging educational products such as curriculum materials, immersive multimedia experiences, a planetarium show, and an engaging web interface. Graduate students are involved in obtaining and producing outreach content and communications products. The MCO also facilitates outreach activities across the broader MOSAiC community by engaging the participation of many MOSAiC scientists and hosting and disseminating outreach products and content. Products, such as the planetarium show along with its supporting educational curriculum materials, are intended to be distributed for use in local communities by numerous partners across the US and internationally. All activities of the MCO are subject to a rigorous evaluation to assess and maximize their overall impact. Lastly, the MCO's role in overall project co-leadership for MOSAiC science, outreach, and communications maintains a prominent role for the US in this international endeavor and ensures that US objectives are prioritized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project pairs new distance learning software, Self-Induced Learning Infrastructure (SELIN), with materials designed to generate enthusiasm among college students for science research.  Several programs in Alaska are currently using community based traditional knowledge as a launching point for science education.  A good example is an existing lesson that uses dog sleds to teach physics to students from rural Alaskan communities.   The Alaska based SELIN project team will add to these efforts by investigating a new area of social science research on human-animal interactions by investigating the relationships between dog mushers and their dogs.  This relationship will be documented and the data used to create a course that teaches social science concepts and research methods to college students. <br/><br/>SELIN, the new e-learning platform developed at the University of Neuchtel, Switzerland, lends itself to a variety of observational sciences including biology, veterinary medicine, sociology, linguistics, and child development.  The availability of SELIN distance courses in English will make the platform accessible to a wider audience.  The findings and data that come from this research (which will be made available, unedited, to other researchers) about the cultural and economic factors that drive dog mushing will be beneficial to veterinarians and those involved in resource management in the Arctic.  The fact that the course is asynchronous means it can deliver science to communities where there is limited access to scientists and science education, among them rural and Indigenous Arctic communities for whom the subject matter is of particular interest.  The findings from the research used to develop the course on human and animal communication offer insights for those involved in practical applications such as training and coordinating activities with animal species for search and rescue, law enforcement, and potentially service animals who assist the disabled."

An observational program will generate vast amounts of new biogeochemical data that will provide a greatly improved view of the dynamics and ecosystem responses of the Southern Ocean. A modeling component will apply these observations to enhancing understanding of the current ocean, reducing uncertainty in projections of future carbon and nutrient cycles and climate.<br/><br/>Because it serves as the primary gateway through which the intermediate, deep, and bottom waters of the ocean interact with the surface layers and thus the atmosphere, the Southern Ocean has a profound influence on the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon and heat as well as nutrient resupply from the abyss to the surface. Yet it is the least observed and understood region of the world ocean. The oceanographic community is on the cusp of two major advances that have the potential to transform understanding of the Southern Ocean. The first is the development of new biogeochemical sensors mounted on autonomous profiling floats that allow sampling of ocean biogeochemistry and acidification in 3-dimensional space with a temporal resolution of five to ten days. The SOCCOM float program proposed will increase the average number of biogeochemical profiles measured per month in the Southern Ocean by ~10-30x. The second is that the climate modeling community now has the computational resources and physical understanding to develop fully coupled climate models that can represent crucial mesoscale processes in the Southern Ocean, as well as corresponding models that assimilate observations to produce a state estimate. Together with the observations, this new generation of models provides the tools to vastly improve understanding of Southern Ocean processes and the ability to quantitatively assess uptake of anthropogenic carbon and heat, as well as nutrient resupply, both today and into the future.<br/><br/>In order to take advantage of the above technological and modeling breakthroughs, SOCCOM will implement the following research programs:<br/>* Theme 1: Observations. Scripps Institution of Oceanography will lead a field program to expand the number of Southern Ocean autonomous profiling floats and equip them with sensors to measure pH, nitrate, and oxygen. The University of Washington and Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute will design, build, and oversee deployment of the floats. Scripps will also develop a mesoscale eddying Southern Ocean state estimate that assimilates physical and biogeochemical data into the MIT ocean general circulation model.<br/>* Theme 2: Modeling. University of Arizona and Princeton University, together with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), will use SOCCOM observations to develop data/model assessment metrics and next-generation model analysis and evaluation, with the goal of improving process level understanding and reducing the uncertainty in projections of our future climate.<br/><br/>Led by Climate Central, an independent, non-profit journalism and research organization that promotes understanding of climate science, SOCCOM will collaborate with educators and media professionals to inform policymakers and the public about the challenges of climate change and its impacts on marine life in the context of the Southern Ocean. In addition, the integrated team of SOCCOM scientists and educators will:<br/>* communicate data and results of the SOCCOM efforts quickly to the public through established data networks, publications, broadcast media, and a public portal;<br/>* train a new generation of diverse ocean scientists, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows versed in field techniques, data calibration, modeling, and communication of research to non-scientists;<br/>* transfer new sensor technology and related software to autonomous instrument providers and manufacturers to ensure that they become widely useable."

One of the most striking Arctic observations in the 21st century has been a reduction in both sea-ice extent and thickness, and an increase of freshwater content in the BG region. At present, there are insufficient observations or theories to reach a consensus among the different opinions about these changes and their impact on climate. The BG summer freshwater content has increased by 6,600 km3 since 2003. Not only does this have important consequences for Arctic sea-ice, ocean thermodynamics, and ecosystems, but a possible fresh water release from the Arctic of this magnitude is enough to cause a salinity anomaly in the North Atlantic with a magnitude comparable to the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1970s, which could influence global climate by reducing the ocean meridional overturning circulation and result in cooling. Thus, the BG system is a potential source to force significant climate changes, likely at decadal time scales. Data returned from this project and distributed freely via the project website and archived with the NSF Arctic Data Center will continue to advance our understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological drivers of environmental change in the Arctic, their relationship to the climate system, and linkages to global processes. Long-term time series of project data will facilitate numerical model initialization and validation and stimulate general interest in Arctic science issues. The knowledge gained under this project will continue to be vital to a wide variety of Arctic processes and climate studies, to operational forecasting and other Arctic research programs, and will spur further valuable investigations of the Arctic Ocean. This project will continue to expand international cooperation and promote widespread access to Arctic for both researchers and the general public. Educational activities will include training of graduate students providing them the opportunity to participate in BG cruises and advising them in BG data analysis. The project data will continue to be used by the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project and Arctic community to validate and improve Arctic regional and global models, test hypotheses, and answer scientific questions.<br/><br/>The Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) will be continued throughout 2019-2020 to observe a set of environmental parameters using bottom-anchored moorings and shipboard measurements to continue the long-term time-series at standard locations. Ship-based synoptic sampling covering the entire BG will continue to be performed each summer in collaboration with Canadian scientists to observe reversal of the climatic circulation regime that has been persistent in one sense over the observation period. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, barium, CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, alkalinity, total CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, tritium/3-He and delta-O-18 will continue to be measured and analyzed along sections at 140W, 150W, ~75N and ~78N using a shipboard CTD/rosette.

It serves as an important platform for the accumulation and transport of dissolved and particulate material, retained in the sea ice cover via atmospheric deposition, fluid exchange with the underlying ocean, sediment inclusions, and biological activity. This material, including nutrients, serves key functions in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. However, the influence of sea ice processes on nutrient cycling and the seasonal cycle of important biogeochemical processes is poorly understood, especially as related to changes in Arctic sea ice. This project will quantify and track changes in the inventory and fluxes of key biogeochemical and physical parameters above, within and below the sea ice through a full year. Data collection and numerical simulations will improve modeling of key processes and projections of future states of the Arctic Ocean and its role in the Earth system. <br/><br/>The planed Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) project provides an opportunity to address pressing scientific questions revolving around the rapid transformations underway in Arctic marine physical and biogeochemical environments, linked to major losses in summer sea ice. This study contributes to the broader MOSAiC goals set by the research community, focusing on improved understanding and prediction of the Arctic through improved sea ice/ocean and earth system model parameterizations of key physical and biogeochemical processes. Collection of biogeochemical and physical data over an annual cycle at MOSAiC's central Arctic drifting ice camp will be informed by modeling needs, and apply community-endorsed standards and best practices for sample acquisition, processing and analysis. Field measurements and sampling will be closely coordinated with the MOSAiC team, with broad, rapid data sharing to inform field studies and modeling work. The extended observation period is essential to improve model parameterizations of snow-ice-ocean cycling of macro- and micronutrients and their impacts on Arctic ecosystems. This project will collect standardized ice data that are directly comparable with those of other participants and that are guided by and improve model simulations and projections. <br/><br/>This field effort will greatly enhance our understanding of sea ice seasonal cycles, including physical and biogeochemical seasonal evolution. Standardized field data will be made available to a broad international community. This project will leverage previously developed sampling schemes, protocols, custom-made equipment and a biogeochemical model as a strategic US contribution to the vast investment put forth by the international community towards the MOSAiC expedition. Educational impacts include the training and support of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher. These individuals will participate in the expedition and gain experience in standardized sea ice collection and multidisciplinary collaboration. Science communication to larger audience will be accomplished through annual participation in ""Bering Sea Days"", a 5-day event on the Pribilof Island of St. Paul, a detailed blog featuring field experiences and science, and a self-published book that depicts our field experiences targeting K-6 audiences."

These changes may be affecting the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in the ocean. The carbon cycle is complex because there are many processes that control the amount of carbon dioxide in the Arctic Ocean. Plant growth, oxygen use by organisms, ice cover, temperature, and ocean circulation all contribute to differences in the amount of carbon dioxide in the water and the exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere.  As ice cover in the Arctic Ocean decreases, scientists think the water will absorb more anthropogenic (human originated) carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide levels increase, this will lead to the ocean becoming more acid (lower pH) because carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when it dissolves in water. The lower pH water can affect the food web by slowing the growth of shell-forming organisms. Despite these important issues, not much is known about the carbon cycle in the central Arctic Ocean basins. Nearly all measurements have been made close to the Arctic coasts during the low ice summer period, when water for samples are more accessible to scientists. With this National Science Foundation support we will combine forces with another National Science Foundation project and use the Canadian icebreaker Louis S. St-Laurent to reach the under-studied central Arctic Ocean. These data will be made available to the public and other researchers. The project also supports operation of an ocean acidification exhibit for University of Montana?s science museum so we can better share our results with the public. A post-doctoral researcher, research technician, and two undergraduate students will be supported on the project.<br/><br/>     The specific activities on this project are focused on a field effort in fall 2018 that includes shipboard measurements and deployments on moorings and ice-tethered profilers. A shipboard underway partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) measurement system will be installed on the icebreaker. The goal of these measurements is to map sea surface pCO2 over a broad region to quantify air-sea CO2 fluxes. Sensors for pCO2, pH, and dissolved oxygen will be deployed on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution time-series moorings and ice-tethered profilers. Three moorings will be deployed with a subsurface profiler that measures conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved O2. Our sensors are deployed at 35 m depth, just below the subsurface float. These data are used to examine short- and long- term carbon cycle variability in the Canada Basin. Sensors for pCO2 and O2 will also be deployed just under the ice surface on two ice-tethered profilers. These sensors record variability near the ice interface that is not possible with the deeper subsurface moorings. A post-doctoral researcher will lead the data quality control and interpretation and will work with other Arctic scientists to facilitate use of the data in their studies."

Through a series of coordinated international research cruises anticipated for the summers of 2020 and 2021, in different regions of the Arctic Ocean, SAS will provide important baseline information about the Arctic ocean ecosystem, carbon system, and physical environment necessary to understand and predict the impacts of ongoing environmental change on the Arctic.  This workshop will plan coordinated field sampling, international data sharing, education including graduate student participation, post field-season data synthesis, public outreach, and involvement of indigenous communities.  The workshop will sponsor the participation of a group of early career scientists.  US scientists are key participants in the planning of the SAS and will lead this workshop, promoting US leadership in Arctic science.  The SAS will engage the general public in Arctic research, increase science literacy and will include multiple audiences (early career, educators, under-represented groups) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research and careers. The outcomes of the SAS field effort will provide baseline understanding of the Arctic system that can be used by national and international policy makers to effectively plan and manage human activities in the Arctic, such as transportation, resource development, and, potentially, commercial fishing.  <br/><br/>Understanding of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem and carbon system, their dependencies on physical drivers, and their interactions with neighboring shelves and ocean regions remains inadequate to project how environmental change may modify these systems on a Pan-Arctic scale.  The Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) is an international program envisioned to mount a coordinated, multi-nation, field-based effort on a Pan Arctic scale quasi-synoptically over one-two summers to achieve the baseline understanding of the fundamental structure and function of the linked carbon-ecosystem-physical systems that will permit detection of ongoing and future changes.  The SAS is focused on a single overarching question, ""What are the present state and major ongoing transformations of the Arctic marine system?"". The field effort would provide the parameters needed to project future trajectories of change both conceptually and through coupled physical-chemical-biological modeling.  It is envisioned that the effort, or parts of the effort, would be continued on decadal scales to detect change.  This grant provides resources to host an international, open-to-all 2-day planning workshop and a follow on 1-day planning and writing workshop for the US SAS Scientific Steering Committee to be held in Woods Hole, MA in May 2019. The overall goals of the workshop include promoting interest and participation in the SAS from US and international scientists (especially early career scientists), designing a concrete international implementation that expands on the present international Science and Implementation Plan, discuss the planned years of deployment, and engage interested US and international program managers. For the US only, further goals include codifying and writing a US Implementation Plan and identifying a strategy for activities and proposals that would lead to US participation in the SAS.  The planned outcomes and products of the workshop include a workshop report, a draft management plan, a blueprint/plan for nurturing the next generation of scientists, and a US implementation plan.

In Antarctica, where surface melting is limited, the speed of ice flow through the grounding zone (where ice on land detaches, and begins to float on ocean water) controls the rate at which glaciers contribute to sea level rise. The velocity of the ice stream is strongly dependent on resistance from the bed, so understanding the processes that control resistance to flow is critical in predicting ice sheet mass balance. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognized this and stated in their 4th assessment report that reliable predictions of future global sea-level rise require improved understanding of ice sheet dynamics, which include basal controls on fast ice motion. Drilling to obtain direct observations of basal properties over substantial regions is prohibitively expensive. This project uses passive source seismology to ""listen to"" and analyze sounds generated by water flow and/or sticky spots at the ice/bed interface to evaluate the role that basal shear stress plays in ice flow dynamics. Because polar science is captivating to both scientists and the general public, it serves as an excellent topic to engage students at all levels with important scientific concepts and processes. In conjunction with this research, polar science educational materials will be developed to be used by students spanning middle school through the University level. Starting in summer 2015, a new polar science class for high school students in the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) will be offered at the University of California-Santa Cruz. This curriculum will be shared with the MESA Schools Program, a Santa Cruz and Monterey County organization that runs after-school science clubs led by teachers at several local middle and high schools with largely minority and underprivileged populations. <br/><br/>This proposal extends the period of borehole and surface geophysical monitoring of the Whillians Ice Stream (WIS) established under a previous award for an additional 2 years. Data from the WIS network demonstrated that basal heterogeneity, revealed by microseismicity, shows variation over scales of 100's of meters. An extended observation period will allow detailed seismic characterization of ice sheet bed properties over a crucial length scale comparable to the local ice thickness. Due to the fast ice velocity (>300 m/year), a single instrumented location will move approximately 1 km during the extended 3 year operational period, allowing continuous monitoring of seismic emissions as the ice travels over sticky spots and other features in the bed (e.g., patches of till or subglacial water bodies). Observations over ~1km length scales will help to bridge a crucial gap in current observations of basal conditions between extremely local observations made in boreholes and remote observations of basal shear stress inferred from inversions of ice surface velocity data."

In particular, the 2010 Astronomy & Astrophysics Decadal Survey recommended the development of new instrumentation and observations to explore the CMB polarization. Through publications and data releases, the results of this ambitious program of technical development and scientific research will be shared with the community. The proposed activities contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with technology development, astronomical observations, and scientific analyses. Research and education are also integrated by bringing research activities into the undergraduate classroom. The sharing of forefront research with non-scientists is extended beyond the university through a well-established educational network that reaches a wide audience at all levels of the educational continuum. Through museum partnerships and new media, the SPT outreach and educational efforts will reach large numbers of individuals while personalizing the experience."

GLISN was established through an international collaboration, with 10 nations coordinating their efforts to develop the current 32-station observing network during the last four years.  This project will continue operations of six key stations of the network, as well as data quality control and data-management for the network. It will also improve the telemetry capability at remote stations to maximize the scientific utility of the data, reduce data latency, and reduce logistics costs. Continued leadership by IRIS in the management and coordination of the International GLISN effort will ensure continued return of high-quality data from the full 32-station network.  Observations from the GLISN network will allow improved estimation of the Earth structure under Greenland, critical for reliable estimation, interpretation, and prediction of changes in ice mass, sea level, and the crustal stress state.  These observations will also allow greatly improved analysis of deformation within the ice sheet and at its calving margins due to processes including discrete ice-loss events, melt-water drainage, crevassing, and basal sliding. Seismic analysis provides unique information about glacier dynamics and sub-glacial geology, complementing other remote-sensing and in-situ observations.  GLISN science and outreach will leverage and enhance outreach and education programs undertaken by the IRIS Consortium and its community."

The extent to which the Greenland Ice Sheet will lose mass and contribute to rising sea level&#8232;in the coming decades depends on the discharge from glaciers at its edges and on the surface mass balance, which is the balance between snow accumulation and surface melt. Estimates of Greenland surface mass balance increasingly utilize climate reanalyses and high-resolution regional climate models to determine snow accumulation, surface melt and runoff/refreeze. These models show significant, and model-dependent, biases (differences from observations) along the steep edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet where the highest and most variable (in space and time) rates of accumulation and surface melt are observed. Thus, the edges of the Greenland Ice Sheet are in critical need of updated accumulation&#8232;and melt data to validate models and improve mass balance estimates. The investigators propose a traverse in the Western Greenland percolation zone over two field seasons to develop continuous in-situ snow accumulation and firn density records using ground-based radar and shallow firn cores. The research objectives include: (1) determining the patterns, in time and space, of snow accumulation in Western Greenland over the past 20-40 years; (2) evaluating surface melt refreeze and englacial meltwater storage in the Western Greenland percolation&#8232;zone over the past 20-40 years; and (3) quantifying the accumulation and surface melt biases of the most recent climate reanalysis models and their regional climate model counterparts.<br/><br/>This project will advance knowledge and understanding by providing in-situ validation observations for both the mass gain (snow accumulation) and mass loss (surface melt) components of Western Greenland surface mass balance. The western edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since 2005, due mostly to decreasing surface mass balance. However, surface mass balance trends derived from regional climate models differ by a factor of ~2.5 in this region. Western Greenland firn core accumulation records, required for model validation, generally end in 1996-1998, before the most recent period of accelerated mass loss. The investigators will develop continuous records of Western Greenland snow accumulation over the last 20-40 years using ground-penetrating radar validated by frequent snow pits and&#8232;firn cores (25-30 m) analyzed for chemistry. They also propose to use a multi-offset radar method to calculate continuous firn density&#8232;data, providing a means to assess past surface melt, refreeze and current meltwater storage&#8232;in glacier aquifers. Meltwater refreeze shows the largest variability in regional climate&#8232;models among surface mass balance components, and thus validation observations are critically needed. The traverse route will crisscross the percolation zone, near-parallel to the steepest accumulation and surface melt gradients, which will increase the value of the dataset for model validation. The traverse will overlap previous traverse routes and reoccupy previously sampled sites to update firn core accumulation records by 18-20 years. In addition, the project will collect cores from new sites in data-poor regions at lower elevations, where both accumulation and surface melt increase and regional climate model validation is most needed. Surface mass balance validation of several climate reanalysis models will lead to more accurate assessments&#8232;of current and future Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance trends, which is critical for accurately predicting&#8232;future sea-level rise. The project will integrate research with student&#8232;learning at multiple levels, with an emphasis on the participation of students from underrepresented groups. The project will fund four graduate students, and incorporate numerous undergraduate researchers recruited through successful programs like the Dartmouth Women in Science Project and the Diversity in Undergraduate Geoscience Alliance. K-12 students will be engaged in this project through inquiry-based, web-hosted climate lessons incorporating the University of Maine Climate Reanalyzer and Environmental Change Model, and through field-based programs in the Boise Mountains focused on snow science. The PIs will continue their active public outreach through established and successful programs like the monthly Upper Valley Science Pub and the biannual Snow Day at the Discovery Center of Idaho, in addition to their frequent public presentations and media interviews through their respective Public Affairs offices."

Computer models of ice sheet behavior are central to addressing this challenge. In this project we will test and improve ice sheet models by comparing model predictions of past ice extent to the geologic record in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica.  This innovative project will collect key geologic data from mountains called nunataks that extend above current and former ice levels that can be used as ""dipsticks"" to reconstruct changes in ice elevation that will be used to improve the models.  The end result will be both much better knowledge of past three-dimensional changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and improved models that allow for more accurate simulations of potential future changes in the ice sheet. <br/><br/>This research will fill critical gaps in the geologic record of the pattern and timing of vertical changes in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in western Dronning Maud Land, by focusing on areas that are critical for differentiating between possible models of past ice sheet configuration. Reconstruction of ice-sheet surface changes will involve mapping and cosmogenic nuclide dating of glacially sculpted bedrock, ice-marginal moraines, and erratic boulders at different elevations on nunataks. Patterns of 10Be, 26Al, 14C, and 21Ne concentrations and ratios will enable inferences about the timing and magnitude of changes in maximum ice surface elevations and periods of burial by non-erosive (cold-based) ice. Results will be integrated with data from other areas to provide insight into changes across the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet, and into the role of large ice sheets in climate evolution and global sea level changes. The field-based results will provide constraints against which predictive ice sheet models will be tested and improved, contributing to glaciology, climate and Quaternary science. Broader impacts of this study will also advance the development of the next generation of STEM students and polar scientists. While gaining experience in international collaboration, field and laboratory methods, data analysis, and modeling, two graduate students will work with teachers to develop, implement, and disseminate standards-based lesson plans for student activities linking this research to learning objectives for middle school science."

Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual?s lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability).  Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region."

Thwaites Glacier has been accelerating and widening over the past three decades. How fast Thwaites will disintegrate or how quickly it will find a new stable state have become some of the most important questions of the future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea-level rise over the next decades to centuries and beyond.  This project will rely on three independent numerical models of ice flow, coupled to an ocean circulation model to (1) improve our understanding of the interactions between the ice and the underlying bedrock, (2) analyze how sensitive the glacier is to external changes, (3) assess the processes that may lead to a collapse of Thwaites, and, most importantly, (4) forecast future ice loss of Thwaites. By providing predictions based on a suite of coupled ice-ocean models, this project will also assess the uncertainty in model projections.<br/><br/>The project will use three independent ice-sheet models: Ice Sheet System Model, Ua, and STREAMICE, coupled to the ocean circulation model of the MIT General Circulation Model. The team will first focus on the representation of key physical processes of calving, ice damage, and basal slipperiness that have either not been included, or are poorly represented, in previous ice-flow modelling work. The team will then quantify the relative role of different proposed external drivers of change (e.g., ocean-induced ice-shelf thinning, loss of ice-shelf pinning points) and explore the stability regime of Thwaites Glacier with the aim of identifying internal thresholds separating stable and unstable grounding-line retreat.  Using inverse methodology, the project will produce new physically consistent high-resolution (300-m) data sets on ice-thicknesses from available radar measurements.  Furthermore, the team will generate new remote sensing data sets on ice velocities and rates of elevation change. These will be used to constrain and validate the numerical models, and will also be valuable stand-alone data sets. This process will allow the numerical models to be constrained more tightly by data than has previously been possible.  The resultant more robust model predictions of near-future impact of Thwaites Glacier on global sea levels can inform policy-relevant decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.<br/><br/>The proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are also available at Imnavait, enabling a comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).<br/>"

Data are collected on environmental conditions including water column and sea floor animals that are food for whales, seals, and birds. Data are shared internationally. The project contributes to the U.S. National Ocean Policy and Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee 5-year plan.  The data will be of value to U.S. and international science and management agencies, private industry, and local communities as they try to understand changes to the environment. The project supports three graduate students.<br/><br/>The observational plan includes standard hydrographic and biological measurements along five transect lines located in the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas. These sampling locations are arrayed south-to-north and reflect a gradient of seasonal sea ice change and seawater warming. The investigators chose these 5 regions because they are zones of high biological productivity and biodiversity. Results so far indicate a freshening and warming of Pacific seawater which transits northward over the spring to fall season. These changes have impacted prey for larger marine mammals and seabirds. Satellite observations are also used to evaluate seasonal changes in sea ice concentration, surface seawater temperature, and chlorophyll concentration. The biological measurements focus on lower trophic levels and shipboard surveys of upper trophic level organisms. This research will increase our understanding of the impact of key environmental forcing parameters on biological change in the system. The collection of key prey-predator biological data along with physical and chemical measurements will allow for analyses and ecosystem modeling which will promote better understanding of Arctic environmental changes."

The data will provide an age scale (age as a function of depth) by matching the South Pole methane changes with similar data from other ice cores for which the age vs. depth relationship is well known.  The ages provided will allow all other gas measurements made on the South Pole core (by the PI and other NSF supported investigators) to be interpreted accurately as a function of time.  This is critical because a major goal of the South Pole coring project is to understand the history of rare gases in the atmosphere like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, methyl chloride, and methyl bromide.  Relatively little is known about what controls these gases in the atmosphere despite their importance to atmospheric chemistry and climate.  Undergraduate assistants will work on the project and be introduced to independent research through their work.  The PI will continue visits to local middle schools to introduce students to polar science, and other outreach activities (e.g. laboratory tours, talks to local civic or professional organizations) as part of the project. <br/><br/>Methane concentrations from a major portion (2 depth intervals, excluding the brittle ice-zone which is being measured at Penn State University) of the new South Pole ice core will be used to create a gas chronology by matching the new South Pole ice core record with that from the well-dated WAIS Divide ice core record. In combination with measurements made at Penn State, this will provide gas dating for the entire 50,000-year record.  Correlation will be made using a simple but powerful mid-point method that has been previously demonstrated, and other methods of matching records will be explored. The intellectual merit of this work is that the gas chronology will be a fundamental component of this ice core project, and will be used by the PI and other investigators for dating records of atmospheric composition, and determining the gas age-ice age difference independently of glaciological models, which will constrain processes that affected firn densification in the past. The methane data will also provide direct stratigraphic markers of important perturbations to global biogeochemical cycles (e.g., rapid methane variations synchronous with abrupt warming and cooling in the Northern Hemisphere) that will tie other ice core gas records directly to those perturbations. A record of the total air content will also be produced as a by-product of the methane measurements and will contribute to understanding of this parameter. The broader impacts include that the work will provide a fundamental data set for the South Pole ice core project and the age scale (or variants of it) will be used by all other investigators working on gas records from the core.  The project will employ an undergraduate assistant(s) in both years who will conduct an undergraduate research project which will be part of the student's senior thesis or other research paper. The project will also offer at least one research position for the Oregon State University Summer REU site program. Visits to local middle schools, and other outreach activities (e.g. laboratory tours, talks to local civic or professional organizations) will also be part of the project."

Summer sea ice is disappearing and the sea surface is warming and becoming less salty.  This changing physical environment is altering basic biological processes and air-sea exchange of gasses. The carbon cycle is of particular interest in the Arctic because it is unknown how carbon dioxide sources and sinks are changing and whether these changes will lead to increased greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.  It is thought that with less ice cover the Arctic Ocean will absorb more human-produced carbon dioxide. Higher carbon dioxide levels cause the ocean to become more acidic because carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when it dissolves in water.  The increase in the acidity of the water can affect the food web by harming shell-forming organisms.  In spite of these important issues, not much is known about the carbon cycle in the central Arctic Ocean basins. Nearly all measurements of ocean acidity have been made on the Arctic shelves during the summer period when access is easy.  We will measure the amount of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide in the surface water and its acidity in the central Arctic Ocean during a summer cruise on the ice breaker Louis St. Laurent and on year-round oceanographic moorings. Outreach activities include continued operation of an ocean acidification exhibit that we developed for University of Montana?s science museum which has been seen by thousands of museum visitors.<br/><br/>The research will specifically support installment of a shipboard underway pCO2 system along with deployment of pCO2, pH, and photosynthetically active radiation sensors on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution time-series moorings in the Beaufort Sea.  The ship follows the same cruise track since the program began in 2003, starting south on the Beaufort shelf and extending to the northern Canada Basin.  Three moorings are deployed annually with a subsurface profiler that measures conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved O2.  Our sensors are deployed at ~35 m depth, just below the subsurface float. These data will allow us to compute air-sea CO2 fluxes and net community productivity during periods when there is less than 100% ice cover and photosynthetically active radiation is greater than zero. The quality-controlled shipboard and mooring data will be made available to the scientific community by submission of the data to the Arctic data repository (ACADIS)."

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was established in the early 1990s to understand the effects of warming and environmental variability on tundra vegetation properties and ecosystem function.  The ITEX program has been extremely valuable for detection of changes in tundra plant and ecosystem responses to experimental warming and to background climate change across sites that span the major ecosystems of the Arctic.  In 2007, the Alaskan and Greenland ITEX sites were combined into an Arctic Observatory Network (AON).  The current ITEX AON project will continue to document and understand Arctic terrestrial vegetation change and its ecosystem consequences by maintaining the long-term datasets of the ITEX-AON.  The warming experiment of ITEX-AON allows us to assign the cause for observed changes in response to warming instead of relying on simple correlations.  This project provides urgently needed data on changes in vegetation and the importance of these changes for ecosystem services from a variety of Arctic ecosystems.  This project will provide training for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the emerging fields of remote sensing, cybertechnology and big-data analysis. The project will include outreach activities through strong relationships with the CLEO Institute in Miami; the Grand Valley State University Regional Math and Science Center; and K-12 school systems in Miami, Anchorage, Grand Rapids and El Paso. All data from this project are and will be freely available at the NSF Arctic Data Center.<br/><br/>The core datasets of the proposed research include manual observations of phenology, vegetation structure and composition, and ecosystem function (carbon flux and nutrient cycling) on long-term ITEX control and experimental warming plots, repeat measurement of vegetation plots on the long-term 1 km2 vegetation grids, and a multifactor warming/moisture experiment in Greenland. In 2009, the sampling scheme was expanded to include a larger spatial component to amplify the value of the measurements collected. This expansion included the addition of phenocams, automated mobile sensor platforms, and medium-scale aerial imagery. The automated platforms measure a suite of vegetation surface properties with minimal effort across focal transects spanning strong moisture and microtopographic gradients at a near-daily frequency. These measurements capture the fine-scale changes in vegetation over the growing season that are missed by lower frequency manual measurements and provide a bridge between manual measurements and aerial imagery. Medium-scale aerial imagery, using Kite Aerial or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, is acquired throughout the growing season for scaling of manual and automated measurements; satellite imagery is referenced to medium-scale aerial imagery to aid scaling of responses to the regional level. In the newest phase of AON ITEX, we are particularly focused on understanding the relationship between landscape subsidence as a result of permafrost thaw and vegetation structure and function because of the potential for significant positive feedbacks to climate change."

Current constraints on the crustal thickness and seismic velocity structure beneath the TAMs and the WSB are limited, leading to uncertainties over competing geologic models that have been suggested to explain their formation. The PI proposes to broaden the investigation of this region with a new seismic deployment, the Transantarctic Mountains Northern Network (TAMNNET), a 15-station array across the northern TAMs and the WSB that will fill a major gap in seismic coverage. Data from TAMNNET will be combined with that from other previous and ongoing seismic initiatives and will be analyzed using proven modeling techniques to generate a detailed image of the seismic structure beneath the TAMs and the WSB. These data will be used to test three fundamental hypotheses: the TAMs are underlain by thickened crust, the WSB is characterized by thin crust and thick sedimentary layers, and slow seismic velocities are prevalent along strike beneath the TAMs. Results from the proposed study will provide new information about the nature and formation of the Antarctic continent and will help to advance our understanding of important global processes, such as mountain building and basin formation. The proposed research also has important implications for other fields of Antarctic science. Constraints on the origin of the TAMs uplift are critical for climate and ice sheet models, and new information acquired about variations in the thermal and lithospheric structure beneath the TAMs and the WSB will be used to estimate critical ice sheet boundary conditions. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>This project incorporates three educational strategies to promote the integration of teaching and research. Graduate students will be trained in Antarctic tectonics and seismic processing through hands-on fieldwork and data analysis techniques. Through NSF's PolarTREC program, the PI will work with K-12 educators. The PI will develop a three-week summer field program for recent high school graduates and early-career undergraduate students from Minority-Serving Institutions in Alabama. Teaching materials and participant experiences will be shared with individuals outside the program via a course website. Following the summer program, participants who were particularly engaged will be offered internship opportunities to analyze TAMNNET data. In successive years, the students could assist with fieldwork and could be recruited into the graduate program under the PI's supervision. Ultimately, this program would not only serve to educate undergraduates but would also generate a pipeline of underrepresented students into the geosciences."

A new conceptual model is required and this project will begin to refine the issue by focusing on diatoms, which have a less patchy distribution than LCZ and are a key prey item of LCZ.  A major knowledge gap exists in the understanding of the magnitude of diatom loss processes; the logical next step to understanding the fundamental linkage between primary production and fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea is to answer: what is the proportion of diatom primary production available for supporting higher trophic organisms and with which biogeochemical variables does this covary?  Before testing this approach in a field setting, the expected magnitude of change and associated error for diatom organic matter production, including the individual terms that go into that estimate (i.e. abundance, growth rate, cell carbon), must be understood.

A new conceptual model is required and this project will begin to refine the issue by focusing on diatoms, which have a less patchy distribution than LCZ and are a key prey item of LCZ.  A major knowledge gap exists in the understanding of the magnitude of diatom loss processes; the logical next step to understanding the fundamental linkage between primary production and fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea is to answer: what is the proportion of diatom primary production available for supporting higher trophic organisms and with which biogeochemical variables does this covary?  Before testing this approach in a field setting, the expected magnitude of change and associated error for diatom organic matter production, including the individual terms that go into that estimate (i.e. abundance, growth rate, cell carbon), must be understood.  This project will combine culture studies using diatoms isolated from high-latitude regions with literature and BEST program data to meet this initial objective."

The scarcity of exposed rock outcrop in Antarctica, which is 98% ice-covered, makes previously collected rock samples very valuable to the science community. The U.S. Polar Rock Repository (PRR) was established at the Ohio State University in 2003 to meet the need for preserving rock, dredge, and terrestrial core samples from polar areas. The PRR curates geological samples collected primarily from Antarctica and the southern oceans and acquires these collections through donations from institutions and scientists.  The existence of the PRR allows samples collected at a high financial cost to be used to their full scientific potential. Currently more than 40,000 samples are available as no-cost loans for research, education, and museum exhibits.  In addition to the physical samples, the PRR archives supporting materials from the collector, such as images of the samples, field maps, air photos, thin sections, and any associated bibliography/DOIs.  Scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students routinely use samples from the PRR for their research projects.  The PRR also freely loans an educational 'rock box' that contains representative rock, fossil and mineral samples, books and activities about geology and Antarctica to K-12 teachers from across the United States. <br/><br/>The PRR provides stewardship of polar rock sample collections and metadata. It is one of the few lending rock repositories to allow destructive research techniques to be used on samples. The PRR website and in-house digital metadata archive provides for global dissemination of data and also a unique resource for pilot studies, proposal preparation and field logistics planning. The PRR fulfills the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), Antarctic Data Management (2009) directive of providing free, full and open access to metadata and collections. Over the course of the next 5 years, the PRR will work proactively with the research community to acquire scientifically valuable rock collections and supplementary materials that will enhance the PRR collection. Samples will be cataloged following standard curatorial practices and will be made discoverable through the public facing portion of the Collections Management system developed at the Byrd Polar Climate and Research Center. The preservation of these physical samples, along with archiving of associated metadata, and inclusion of DOI?s in a discoverable online database, allows for transparency and reproducibility in polar earth science research. The Collections Management System will continue to be updated and improved.  The Curator will continue to advance the discoverability of the PRR by attending meetings, creating a webinar and contacting scientists about new collections at the facility. The PRR will continue to fulfill loans of samples and enhance the links with other respositories and data management entities to better enable interdisciplinary research. Educational outreach to K-12 schools will continue with the 'polar rock box' being freely available to US schools."

In the tundra and boreal forest, large amounts of water are released during a short period (2 to 3 weeks) in spring when the winter's snow rapidly melts. Most of this snowmelt water flows out through rivers, because the ground is mostly frozen during snowmelt, while the remaining sizable fraction of snowmelt water is thought to be lost through evaporation or sublimation, or to groundwater recharge in those areas where permafrost doesn't prevent it. Uptake and storage by plants at this time of year has been considered negligible. Preliminary data from a small watershed in interior Alaska shows that deciduous trees take up 25-40% of the snowmelt water prior to leaf out and draw from these stores throughout the summer, including during lengthy dry periods. Preliminary data also show that arctic deciduous shrub stems rise and fall diurnally as the snow melts, which the investigators suspect is linked with water uptake, but the link between shrub water content and snowmelt is unknown. Water uptake by deciduous trees and shrubs has important ecosystem implications, from the water balance to climate feedbacks to coping strategies of deciduous vegetation during dry periods. The observed expansion of deciduous shrubs and trees in Alaska during the 20th century is likely altering the water balance and Arctic ecosystem in ways currently not being considered.<br/><br/>The investigators ask: To what extent do deciduous vegetation (trees and shrubs) use snowmelt water? What are the consequences of deciduous tree and shrub expansion on the ecohydrology of northern ecosystems? What are the plant ecological consequences (such as buffering from weather variability) of the storage and use of snowmelt water? They propose to characterize shrub and tree physiology (water uptake, water stress, transpiration, growth, photosynthesis), as well as environmental variables, including snowmelt, across a climate gradient in Alaska. These data will be integrated into statistical models that will quantify the controls on snowmelt water uptake by trees and shrubs, and will quantify the role of snowmelt water in sustaining physiological activity during dry periods. The proposal addresses emerging avenues of ecohydrology by quantifying the role of deciduous plants on the pathways and reservoirs of snowmelt water, and by assessing the potential for stored snowmelt water to buffer vegetation during dry periods. The transformative nature of the proposed work lies in reconsidering the dogma that vegetation plays a minor role in snowmelt hydrological processes. This reconsideration is salient given the observed widespread expansion of deciduous trees and shrubs and observed advancing snowmelt dates. The project would support two early career investigators, a PhD student, and 3 undergraduate students. Several distinct outreach activities are proposed, including teacher workshops aimed at enhancing the science curriculum of local and rural Alaskan K-12 classrooms, a traveling museum exhibit, an art exhibit featuring the work of the lead PI, and a partnership with a science writer for statewide dissemination of one article per year in statewide (Alaska) news outlets."

That said, some sectors of the current Antarctic ice sheet are losing mass at large and accelerating rates. One of the primary challenges for placing these recent and ongoing changes in the context of geologically historic rates, and for making projections decades to centuries into the future, is the difficulty of observing conditions and processes beneath the ice sheet.  Whereas satellite observations allow tracking of the ice-surface velocity and elevation on the scale of glacier catchments to ice sheets, airborne ice-penetrating radar has been the only approach for assessing conditions on this scale beneath the ice.  These radar observations have been made since the late 1960s, but, because many different instruments have been used, it is difficult to track change in subglacial conditions through time.  This project will develop the technical tools and approaches required to cross-compare among these measurements and thus open up opportunities for tracking and understanding changes in the critical subglacial environment.  Intertwined with the research and student training on this project will be an outreach education effort to provide middle school and high school students with improved resources and enhanced exposure to geophysical, glaciological, and remote-sensing topics through partnership with the National Science Olympiad.<br/><br/>The radar sounding of ice sheets is a powerful tool for glaciological science with broad applicability across a wide range of cryosphere problems and processes. Radar sounding data have been collected with extensive spatial and temporal coverage across the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, including areas where multiple surveys provide observations that span decades in time or entire cross-catchment ice-sheet sectors. However, one major obstacle to realizing the scientific potential of existing radar sounding observations in Antarctica is the lack of analysis approaches specifically developed for cross-instrument interpretation. This project aims to directly address these barriers to full utilization of the collective Antarctic radar sounding record by developing a suite of processing and interpretation techniques to enable the synthesis of radar sounding data sets collected with systems that range from incoherent to coherent, single-channel to swath-imaging, and digital to optically-recorded radar sounders.  The approaches will be assessed for two target regions: the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the Siple Coast.  All pre- and post-processed sounding data produced by this project will be publically hosted for use by the wider research community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ice streams and outlet glaciers are the major pathways for ice discharge from ice sheets into the ocean. Consequently, understanding ice stream dynamics, specifically the processes controlling the frictional resistance of ice sliding on sediments at its base, is essential for predictive modeling of how Earth's ice sheets will respond to a changing climate. Rather than flowing smoothly, Whillans Ice Stream advances in stick-slip cycles: brief periods of rapid sliding, equivalent to magnitude 7 earthquakes, alternating with much longer periods of repose. The PIs will perform simulations of these stick-slip cycles using computer codes originally developed for modeling tectonic earthquakes. By matching observed ice motions, the PIs will constrain the range of frictional processes acting at the base of the ice stream. An additional focus of the project is on brittle fracture processes in ice, expressed through seismic waves radiated by faulting and/or crevassing episodes that accompany the large-scale sliding events. An understanding of ice fracture provides a basis for assessing the susceptibility of ice shelves to rifting and catastrophic disintegration. Project results will be incorporated into outreach activities (from elementary school to community college events) as well as a polar science class for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program for high school students.<br/><br/>Simulations of the stick-slip cycle will employ 3D dynamic rupture models that simultaneously solve for the seismic wavefield and rupture process, consistent with elastodynamic material response and friction laws on the ice stream bed. Stresses and frictional properties will be varied to achieve consistency with surface GPS and broadband seismic data as well as borehole seismograms from the WISSARD project. The results will be interpreted using laboratory till friction experiments, which link velocity-weakening/strengthening behavior to temperature and water content, and to related experiments quantifying basal drag from ice flow over rough beds. The source mechanism of seismicity accompanying the slip events (shear faulting versus crevassing) will be determined using 3D waveform modeling in conjunction with mechanical models of the seismic source processes.  This proposal does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic."

Changes in the character and seasonal cycle of nearshore sea ice is of particular importance to indigenous communities that use the nearshore sea ice as a platform for subsistence hunting and transportation.  Observations and model projections also suggest increasing freshwater runoff to the coastal ocean from increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, thawing of permafrost, and precipitation over land.  This runoff impacts the sea ice that forms in the fall.  Sea ice formed under freshwater influence reveals differences in salinity, porosity, and permeability, and thus its optical and mechanical properties.  This project will provide unique observations of sea ice formation and structure under conditions of freshwater influence.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support for the training of a graduate student.

K-12th grade outreach activities will be offered and will leverage existing programs at University of Washington such as participation in the Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center.  <br/><br/>The freshwater discharge to the coastal ocean affects thermodynamic processes in sea ice by changing salinity and temperature of the waters undergoing freezing.  This three-year pilot project is designed to study sea ice formation and structure in the coastal ocean, while addressing the following important questions:<br/>1. How do microstructure and the brine pocket network differ in sea ice that forms and grows where there is significant fresh water input compared to sea ice in the open ocean?<br/>2. Can we monitor the onset of freezing, freezing rate and ice type in situ in sensitive nearshore areas, while collecting data remotely?<br/>3. How does microstructure affect heat transfer along the length of an ice core?<br/>The project will combine recently developed observation and sampling technologies, and integrate expertise in field monitoring, and physical and chemical sea ice characterization. Sea ice formation, growth rate, and salinity will be monitored in situ at a location of freshwater input during the course of a growth season using a wire ladder.  Oxygen isotopic ratios and optical thin section stratigraphy will be used to quantify freshwater influence.  X-ray micro-computed tomography will be used to characterize porosity and brine channel topology at 1 cm intervals along ice cores and provide quantitative data on microstructural differences in ice influenced by the freshwater.

Over the past several decades, the Arctic has been warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and most of this warming has occurred during winter when the Arctic receives very little sunlight. Until recently, the primary research focus in Arctic science has been on warm season processes; however, recent studies show that during winter when there is virtually no sunlight over the Arctic, warm moist air associated with weather systems is transported from the midlatitudes into the Arctic.  These warm moist air intrusions, which can even warm high Arctic regions, have been occurring more frequently during recent years. <br/><br/>This research will improve extended and seasonal prediction of Arctic sea ice.

The workshop activity will enhance the teachers' awareness of the importance of studying the Arctic for the winter season. CSATS will evaluate the effectiveness of the workshop through pre/post tests, making necessary adjustments to the pedagogy sessions and activities for the second workshop.<br/><br/>Mechanisms that drive day-to-month variability of Arctic surface air temperature will be investigated.

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage ""arm-chair"" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public. Anyone with access to the internet, including people who are physically unable to participate in field research directly, can participate in this project while simultaneously learning about multiple aspects of polar ecology through the project's interactive website.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this research project will: 1) Quantify the distribution of Weddell seals around Antarctica and 2) Determine the impact of environmental variables (such as fast ice extent, ocean productivity, bathymetry) on habitat suitability and occupancy. To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time.

LIDAR images collected in 2014/2015 will be compared to images from 2001 in order to detect decadal change. Additional fieldwork will look at the distribution of buried massive ice, and the impacts that major changes like slumping are having on the biota. All field data will be used to improve models on energy balance, and hydrology.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  There have been dramatic changes over the past decade in the McMurdo Dry Valleys: glaciers are deflating by tens of meters, rivers are incising by more than three meters, and thermokarst slumps are appearing near several streams and lakes. These observations have all been made by researchers in the field, but none of the changes have been mapped on a valley-wide scale. This award will provide a new baseline map for the entire Dry Valley system, with high-resolution imagery provided for the valley floors, and lower resolution imagery available for the higher elevation areas that are undergoing less change.  The project will test the idea that sediment-covered ice is associated with the most dramatic changes, due to differential impacts of the increased solar radiation on sediment-covered compared to clean ice, and despite the current trend of slightly cooling air temperatures within the Dry Valleys. Information collected on the topography, coupled with the GPR determined buried ice distributions, will also be incorporated into improved energy and hydrological models. In addition to providing the new high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), the project will ultimately result in identification of areas that are susceptible to sediment-enhanced melt-driven change, providing a powerful prediction tool for the impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The new DEM will be immediately useful to a wide range of disciplines, and will provide a comprehensive new baseline against which future changes will be compared. The project will provide a tool for the whole community to use, and the investigators will work with the community to make them aware of the new assets via public presentations, and perhaps via a workshop. The map will have international interest, and will also serve as a tool for environmental managers to draw on as they consider conservation plans.  Several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the project, and one of the co-PIs is a new investigator.

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage ""arm-chair"" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public. Anyone with access to the internet, including people who are physically unable to participate in field research directly, can participate in this project while simultaneously learning about multiple aspects of polar ecology through the project's interactive website.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this research project will: 1) Quantify the distribution of Weddell seals around Antarctica and 2) Determine the impact of environmental variables (such as fast ice extent, ocean productivity, bathymetry) on habitat suitability and occupancy. To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time. The project includes a rigorous plan for ensuring quality control in the dataset including ground truth data from other, localized projects concurrently funded by the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Science Program."

The South Pole ice core will allow investigation of atmospheric trace gases and fill an important gap in understanding the pattern of climate variability across Antarctica. An accurate timescale that assigns an age to the ice at each depth in the core is essential to interpretation of the ice-core records. This work will use electrical methods to identify volcanic eruptions throughout the past ~40,000 years in the core by detecting the enhanced electrical conductance in those layers due to volcanic impurities in the ice. These eruptions will be pattern-matched to other cores across Antarctica, synchronizing the timing of climate variations among cores and allowing the precise timescales developed for other Antarctic ice cores to be transferred to the South Pole ice core. The well-dated records of volcanic forcing will be combined with records of atmospheric gases, stable water-isotopes, and aerosols to better understand the large natural climate variations of the past 40,000 years.  <br/> <br/>The electrical conductance method and dielectric profiling measurements will be made along the length of each section of the South Pole ice core at the National Ice Core Lab.   These measurements will help to establish a timescale for the core. Electrical measurements will provide a continuous record of volcanic events for the entire core including through the brittle ice (550-1250m representing ~10,000-20,000 year-old ice) where the core quality and thin annual layers may prevent continuous melt analysis and cause discrete measurements to miss volcanic events. The electrical measurements also produce a 2-D image of the electrical layering on a longitudinal cut surface of each core. These data will be used to identify any irregular or absent layering that would indicate a stratigraphic disturbance in the core. A robust chronology is essential to interpretation of the paleoclimate records from the South Pole ice core. The investigators will engage teachers through talks and webinars with the National Science Teachers Association and will share information with the public at events such as Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center. Results will be disseminated through publications and conference presentations and the data will be archived and publicly available."

Changes in the character and seasonal cycle of nearshore sea ice is of particular importance to indigenous communities that use the nearshore sea ice as a platform for subsistence hunting and transportation.  Observations and model projections also suggest increasing freshwater runoff to the coastal ocean from increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, thawing of permafrost, and precipitation over land.  This runoff impacts the sea ice that forms in the fall.  Sea ice formed under freshwater influence reveals differences in salinity, porosity, and permeability, and thus its optical and mechanical properties.  This project will provide unique observations of sea ice formation and structure under conditions of freshwater influence.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support for the training of a graduate student.  It will also entrain undergraduate students from Dartmouth?s Women in Science Project (WISP).  One undergraduate will participate in the spring field work.

K-12th grade outreach activities will be offered and will leverage existing programs at University of Washington such as participation in the Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center.  <br/><br/>The freshwater discharge to the coastal ocean affects thermodynamic processes in sea ice by changing salinity and temperature of the waters undergoing freezing.  This three-year pilot project is designed to study sea ice formation and structure in the coastal ocean, while addressing the following important questions:<br/>1. How do microstructure and the brine pocket network differ in sea ice that forms and grows where there is significant fresh water input compared to sea ice in the open ocean?<br/>2. Can we monitor the onset of freezing, freezing rate and ice type in situ in sensitive nearshore areas, while collecting data remotely?<br/>3. How does microstructure affect heat transfer along the length of an ice core?<br/>The project will combine recently developed observation and sampling technologies, and integrate expertise in field monitoring, and physical and chemical sea ice characterization. Sea ice formation, growth rate, and salinity will be monitored in situ at a location of freshwater input during the course of a growth season using a wire ladder.  Oxygen isotopic ratios and optical thin section stratigraphy will be used to quantify freshwater influence.  X-ray micro-computed tomography will be used to characterize porosity and brine channel topology at 1 cm intervals along ice cores and provide quantitative data on microstructural differences in ice influenced by the freshwater.  Laboratory tests and modeling will be used to examine heat transfer through sea ice cores held at their in situ temperature gradient, as a function of microstructural stratigraphy."

Understanding these relationships forms the backbone for both basic and applied science because fish often serve as models of human traits and diseases.  Some of the main lines of evidence for these relationships come from fossils in rocks over 380 million years old that were originally deposited as ancient rivers and streams.  Because rocks of this type and age are abundantly exposed along a number of the dry valleys and mountains of Antarctica, the investigation of these areas holds exceptional promise for discoveries that can have a broad impact.  The fieldwork will involve geological mapping and assessment of the rocks with detailed reconnaissance for the fossils that they may hold.  Fossil discoveries form the backbone for public communication of the methods and results of scientific research-- these studies will be used as vehicles for training of students at multiple levels as well as communication of science to the broader non-science citizen base.<br/><br/>The discovery, description, and analysis of Middle to Late Devonian (390-355 Million years ago) vertebrates and depositional environments provide important data on the emergence of novel anatomical structures, faunas, and habitats during a critical interval in the history of life and earth.  Biological innovation during this time includes the early evolution of freshwater fish, the origins of major groups of vertebrates (e.g., sharks, lobe and ray-finned fish, tetrapods), and the expansion and elaboration of non-marine ecosystems.  Accordingly, expanding our knowledge of vertebrate diversity during the Middle and Late Devonian will provide new evidence on the relationships of the major groups of vertebrates, the assembly of novelties that ultimately enabled tetrapods to invade land, the origin and early evolution of sharks and their relatives, and the assembly and expansion of non-marine ecosystems generally. The Aztec Siltstone of Antarctica Middle-Late Devonian; Givetian-Frasnian Stages) has exceptional potential to produce new paleontological evidence of these events and to illuminate the temporal, ecological, and geographic context in which they occurred.  It is essentially fossiliferous throughout its known exposure range, something that is rare for Middle-Late Devonian non-marine rocks anywhere in the world. In addition, fine-grained meandering stream deposits are abundantly exposed in the Aztec Siltstone and are recognized as an important locus for the discovery of well-preserved Devonian fish, including stem tetrapods and their relatives. Given the exceedingly fossiliferous nature of the Aztec Siltstone, the large number of taxa known only from partial material, and the amount of promising exposure yet to be worked, a dedicated reconnaissance, collection, and research effort is designed to recover important new fossil material and embed it in a stratigraphic and sedimentological context. The first major objective of this study is the recovery, preparation, and description of Middle-Late Devonian fossil taxa. Ensuing investigation of the phylogenetic affinities, taphonomic occurrence, and stratigraphic position of fossil assemblages will allow both local and global comparisons of biotic diversity. These analyses will inform: 1) higher level phylogenetic hypotheses of jawed vertebrates, 2) biostratigraphic and biogeographic analysis of the distribution of the Middle-Late Devonian fish, and 3) paleobiological investigation of the elaboration of terrestrial and freshwater habitats.  The broader impacts are derived from the utility of paleontology and Antarctic expeditionary science as educational tools with powerful narratives. Specific goals include affiliations with local urban secondary schools (using established relationships for broadening participation) and collegiate and graduate training. Wider dissemination of knowledge to the general public is a direct product of ongoing interactions with national and international media (print, television, internet)."

The solid ice occurs in the form of icebergs.  The influence of these icebergs on the stratification and circulation of water in fjords, as well as on the freshwater content of the adjacent ocean, is poorly understood.  This project will improve understanding of the role of icebergs in fjords and the coastal ocean through intensive process studies on iceberg melt and movement.  These studies will include both field observations and numerical modeling experiments.  <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the development of the nation's STEM workforce by providing support for the training of a graduate student and a post-doctoral associate.

Additionally, the project will allow the PI to extend his prior collaborations with University of Oregon's STEM CORE program to work with a local middle school on STEM-focused curricula.  To enhance outreach to the broader public, the principal investigator will collaborate with a science historian to transcribe archived data into modern format that will be freely distributed, co-deliver public talks, add content to an existing website, and participate in an annual event on Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples organized by his institution.<br/><br/>The ongoing surge in ocean-glacier interactions studies around Greenland is motivated primarily to improve our understanding of the role ocean circulation plays in outlet glacier variability. Two potential mechanisms that lead to glacier acceleration and dynamic thinning are (1) increased submarine melting due to an enhanced ocean heat transport to the glacier termini, and (2) a weakening of the ice mlange that buttresses the glacier face. Fjords act as links between these two processes with the large-scale climate forcing on one hand (both oceanic and atmospheric) and the Greenland ice sheet variability on the other. However, one key process, iceberg melt, has been largely neglected in most fjord circulation studies due to a narrow focus on plume driven circulation, as well as the overall difficulty of obtaining in situ observations. This proposal aims to gather novel observations on iceberg melt and movement in Greenland?s fjords by tracking the horizontal and vertical motion of large, deep-keeled icebergs at high temporal resolution. Tracking individual icebergs, combined with ship- and drone-based surveys, will allow quantification not only of iceberg melt rates, but also of their movement through the fjord and eventual dispersal across the shelf and into the interior ocean. Fieldwork will be conducted in relatively well-studied systems in Greenland, with the potential for rapid generalization to other systems. Complemented by numerical ocean modeling, these process studies will enable assessment of how well current parameterizations capture the melt processes occurring in Greenland's waters. Ultimately, these results will provide a solid foundation for improving understanding of the spatial and temporal picture of iceberg motion and melt and how this can be incorporated into operational iceberg trajectory models, as well as global scale climate models."

Wide-scale observations of freshwater ice and how its presence has changed over time will meet a fundamental need for a broad range of stakeholders, from rural communities that depend on ice for transportation and subsistence harvest, to industries that rely on winter water for ice road construction, to scientists studying climate change and ecosystem services. The Fresh Eyes on Ice observation network addresses this need by collecting data across a wide area of interior, western, and northern Alaska using satellite observations, monitoring stations on lakes and rivers, and field campaigns by snowmachine--all integrated with a partnership of community-based local scientists, teachers, and school children. The design for this observation network builds on the Alaska Lake Ice and Snow Observatory Network (ALISON), a project hosted by University of Alaska Fairbanks from 1999 to 2011 that used this basic premise for hands-on data collection by K-12 students and teachers in communities across Alaska. Teachers still informally use the ALISON program; by reviving this approach through the Fresh Eyes on Ice observation network, using modernized techniques, this project will foster new appreciation for environmental change in the Arctic and inspire new scientists, in addition to providing valuable information in a time of rapid change.<br/><br/>Winter is the most rapidly changing season in the Arctic, causing widespread responses in freshwater ice and the ecosystems and communities that rely on frozen lakes and rivers.  Freshwater ice dynamics--the formation, growth, and melt of ice--not only integrate winter climate conditions, but also impact permafrost, hydrology, greenhouse gas emissions, and human travel and subsistence. Long-term observations document dramatic changes in ice thickness and breakup timing in lakes and rivers of northern latitudes. Such ice observations come from rigorous programs conducted by government and academic scientists using satellites, in situ sensors, and sophisticated field measurements, but also from lake- and river-side communities, school classrooms, and subsistence-users who watch these changes daily. Together these ice observations provide a valuable and integrated record of winter climate change relevant at local, regional, and global-scales. Navigating the new Arctic with Fresh Eyes on Ice, a new freshwater ice observation network, revitalizes existing datasets and expands observations in space and time using modern satellite, aerial, and in situ sensing techniques integrated with community-based monitoring teams. Extensive late winter field campaigns, dedicated social media and data sharing between widely spaced communities and interested scientists, and visualization systems will connect communities in boreal and arctic Alaska, making science education and outreach seamless components of this observing network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core objectives are gaining understanding of the drivers of spatial and temporal patterns in the amounts of CAP and CAE across the tundra; caribou use of this nutritional landscape; how the amounts of CAP and CAE will differ in the future under likely climate scenarios and long-term experiments, and the interactions between caribou and Native communities. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study involve several groups of Alaskan stakeholders, including: harvesters of the North Slope community of Nuiqsut, the worldwide caribou community, and students at multiple stages of education.

This work builds on several ongoing studies at Siple Dome in West Antarctica and Dome C in East Antarctica.  It is well known that the microstructure of ice evolves with depth and time in an ice sheet. This evolution of microstructure depends on the ice flow field, temperature, and impurity content. The ice flow field, in turn, depends on microstructure, leading to feedbacks that create layered variation in microstructure that relates to climate and flow history. The research proposed here focuses on developing a better understanding of: 1) how ice microstructure evolves with time and stress in an ice sheet and how that relates to impurity content, temperature, and strain rate; 2) how variations in ice microstructure and impurity content affect ice flow patterns near ice divides (on both small (1cm to 1m) and large (1m to 100km) scales); and 3) in what ways is the spatial variability of ice microstructure and its effect on ice flow important for interpretation of climate history in the WAIS Divide ice core. The study will integrate existing ice core and borehole data with a detailed study of ice microstructure using Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) techniques and measurements of borehole deformation through time using Acoustic Televiewers. This will be the first study to combine these two novel techniques for studying the relation between microstructure and deformation and it will build on other data being collected as part of other WAIS Divide borehole logging projects (e.g. sonic velocity, optical dust logging, temperature and other measurements on the ice core including fabric measurements from thin section analyses as well as studies of ice chemistry and stable isotopes.  The intellectual merit of the work is that it will improve interpretation of ice core data (especially information on past accumulation) and overall understanding of ice flow. The broader impacts are that the work will ultimately contribute to a better interpretation of ice core records for both paleoclimate studies and for ice flow history, both of which connect to the broader questions of the role of ice in the climate system. The work will also advance the careers of two early-career female scientists, including one with a hearing impairment disability. This project will support a PhD student at the UAF and provide research and field experience for two or three undergraduates at Dartmouth. The PIs plan to include a teacher on their field team and collaborate with UAF's ""From STEM to STEAM"" toward enhancing the connection between art and science."

These recent changes along with longer-term climate and ecosystem histories will be deciphered using peat deposits. Peat accumulation can be used to assess the rate of glacial retreat and provide insight into ecological processes on newly deglaciated landscapes in the Antarctic Peninsula. This project builds on data suggesting recent ecosystem transformations that are linked to past climate of the western Antarctic Peninsula and provide a timeline to assess the extent and rate of recent glacial change. The study will produce a climate record for the coastal low-elevation terrestrial region, which will refine the major climate shifts of up to 6 degrees C in the recent past (last 12,000 years). A novel terrestrial record of the recent glacial history will provide insight into observed changes in climate and sea-ice dynamics in the western Antarctic Peninsula and allow for comparison with off-shore climate records captured in sediments. Observations and discoveries from this project will be disseminated to local schools and science centers. The project provides training and career development for a postdoctoral scientist as well as graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research presents a new systematic survey to reconstruct ecosystem and climate change for the coastal low-elevation areas on the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) using proxy records preserved in late Holocene peat deposits. Moss and peat samples will be collected and analyzed to generate a comprehensive data set of late-Holocene climate change and ecosystem dynamics. The goal is to document and understand the transformations of landscape and terrestrial ecosystems on the western AP during the late Holocene. The testable hypothesis is that coastal regions have experienced greater climate variability than evidenced in ice-core records and that past warmth has facilitated dramatic ecosystem and cryosphere response. A primary product of the project is a robust reconstruction of late Holocene climate changes for coastal low-elevation terrestrial areas using multiple lines of evidence from peat-based biological and geochemical proxies, which will be used to compare with climate records derived from marine sediments and ice cores from the AP region. These data will be used to test several ideas related to novel peat-forming ecosystems (such as Antarctic hairgrass bogs) in past warmer climates and climate controls over ecosystem establishment and migration to help assess the nature of the Little Ice Age cooling and cryosphere response. The chronology of peat cores will be established by radiocarbon dating of macrofossils and Bayesian modeling. The high-resolution time series of ecosystem and climate changes will help put the observed recent changes into a long-term context to bridge climate dynamics over different time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Visual inspection of the core will help identify evidence of flow disturbances that would disrupt the integrity of the climate record and will reveal volcanic horizons and other features of interest. Annual layer counting will be conducted to help estimate accumulation rate over time as recorded in the ice core. Measurements of C-axis fabric, grain size and shapes, and bubble characteristics will provide information about processes occurring in the ice sheet as well as the history of ice flow, current flow state and how the ice is flowing and how easily it will flow in the future. Analysis of this data in conjunction with microCT data will help to reveal grain-scale processes. The broader impacts of the project include support for an early-career, post-doctoral researcher, and improved paleoclimatic data of societal relevance.

A collaborative interdisciplinary team with backgrounds in northern archaeology and ethnography, geology, and materials science will undertake a three-year program of research investigating native copper innovation, and its relationship to emergent social complexity (i.e., the development of hereditary rank), among northwest North American hunter-gatherers. Naturally occurring pure native copper was used by indigenous groups throughout the region for tools, weapons, and objects of personal adornment. This latter use has been traditionally viewed by archaeologists as attempts to display wealth using prestige goods (prestige technology) and as a result, and similar to discussions of prehistoric metallurgy in general, the use of native copper in these regions has been associated with emergent social complexity. <br/><br/>Intra- and inter-regional spatial analysis of sources and artifacts, compositional analysis of artifacts in museum collections, detailed experimental studies of copper-working manufacturing, and oral history collected in collaboration with the Ahtna community, will provide quantitative and qualitative data on native copper innovation. These data will be integrated using a design theory framework that will provide a holistic multi-scalar understanding of the benefits and constraints associated with the adoption of this technology by hunter-gatherers in different social and environmental contexts. Though focused on innovation surrounding the use of a specific material among hunter-gatherers, this project will contribute to more general anthropological discussions of innovation and will generate data for use in developing models of technological innovation for future testing. Additionally, the project includes significant opportunities for interdisciplinary graduate and undergraduate education, training, and hands-on research, and opportunities for multi-generational engagement with the Ahtna community."

Alaska?s land, water, plants, wildlife, and seasons are undergoing a great upheaval, and its people, especially the tribal communities living in remote villages are directly and severely impacted by these changes. The project will help build the tribal capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost by providing the Tribes the scientific knowledge and skills necessary to acquire, analyze, and interpret scientific data through training and education. The project will establish local climate and permafrost observation system and map land cover and permafrost in the Upper Kuskokwim region. It will also develop a geo-hazard map for the region to facilitate safe subsistence and recreational practices and land use.<br/>The specific objectives of this project are to 1) engage traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region in permafrost and climate change research, 2) build community capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost, 3) model the state and distribution of near-surface permafrost, and 4) develop a geo-hazard map. The high-resolution land cover, permafrost, and geo-hazard maps will serve the communities? need to identify sites experiencing rapid changes and could be hazardous. The land cover map will serve as a baseline map to detect future changes in land cover. The modeled permafrost maps of current and future decades will help identify sites where permafrost degradation will likely be severe if the climate continues to warm. <br/>The project will offer the traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region and the Tribal Council an opportunity to engage in climate research. It will provide them the motivation, resources, climate science knowledge and skills to study the impact of climate change on their tribal way of life and environment. The data, knowledge, and skills gained through this project will benefit the tribal communities in adaptive management of subsistence resources, implementation of safe land use practices, and planning for the future. The scientific community will also benefit hugely by having an improved understanding of permafrost dynamics, access to field data and maps from this understudied remote part of Alaska. In addition, the project will provide outreach and workshops on climate change to the community members in Nikolai and to all students and teachers in Iditarod Areas School District through the Distance Learning Center facility in Fairbanks, Alaska."

While low temperatures and short-growing seasons limit plant growth, enough plant biomass exists to support herds of migratory caribou, on which Alaska Natives depend. Any changes in the plants at the base of the food web can have cascading consequences for herbivores and human consumers and their interactions. Today, the Arctic system is in the midst of change resulting in new vegetation assemblages, changes in the nutritive value of plant tissues, and ultimately in the diets of migratory caribou and the humans that depend on them. This project examines the nutritional landscape of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd as a unifying concept, describing the nutritional landscape as caribou available protein (CAP) and caribou available energy&#8232;(CAE), integrative forage quantity measures that reflect biomass, species composition, plant&#8232;C and N content, digestibility, and secondary compounds. The core objectives are gaining understanding of the drivers of spatial and temporal patterns in the amounts of CAP and CAE across the tundra; caribou use of this nutritional landscape; how the amounts of CAP and CAE will differ in the future under likely climate scenarios and long-term experiments, and the interactions between caribou and Native communities. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this study involve several groups of Alaskan stakeholders, including: harvesters of the North Slope community of Nuiqsut, the worldwide caribou community, and students at multiple stages of education. The project will embed a team member with hunters in Nuiqsut,&#8232;and develop an educational scientific documentary on the caribou - Alaska Native interactions for&#8232;high school students. The group plans to employ village students and undergraduates affiliated with the Alaska Native Science&#8232;and Engineering Program to assist with experimental work and vegetation collection at Toolik Lake. This research is significant to ecologists from the Circumarctic Rangifer Monitoring&#8232;and Assessment Network, dedicated&#8232;to caribou conservation and sustainable management in the US, Canada, and Scandinavia, who will use the data to consider how a suite of climate change scenarios affect herd fecundity and population dynamics. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from the merging of five elements to understand Arctic&#8232;System function and response to climate change: (1) A landscape-scale assessment of plant species, soil and plant C and N, digestibility, and secondary compounds that will be used&#8232;to calculate the amounts of CAP (kg m-2) and CAE (kJ m-2); (2) analysis of how closely caribou foraging is tied to the nutritional landscape throughout the year; (3) analysis of samples&#8232;from an existing long-term winter - summer climate change experiment to provide data on how&#8232;CAP and CAE will differ in the future; (4) prediction of future nutritional landscapes and&#8232;caribou foraging interactions; and (5) observations of Alaska Native hunter harvesting and attributes&#8232;of the system that determine their spatial and temporal patterns. These project components will enable an integrative understanding of how an important herbivore, caribou, interact with a landscape that is rapidly changing. This research: (1) examines the Arctic System from primary production to secondary consumers and the&#8232;influence of climate change across multiple trophic levels; (2) applies broadly by examining&#8232;the most abundant large herbivore and its food sources, both of which are distributed throughout&#8232;the Arctic; and (3) integrates experimental, observational, and modeling approaches to understanding ecological systems and climate change. The integration of observation, experimental data&#8232;and modeling to describe current and forecast future nutritional landscapes is intended to provide a&#8232;mechanistic understanding of Arctic System function and transform the understanding&#8232;of climate-vegetation-caribou-subsistence hunter interactions."

These recent changes along with longer-term climate and ecosystem histories will be deciphered using peat deposits. Peat accumulation can be used to assess the rate of glacial retreat and provide insight into ecological processes on newly deglaciated landscapes in the Antarctic Peninsula. This project builds on data suggesting recent ecosystem transformations that are linked to past climate of the western Antarctic Peninsula and provide a timeline to assess the extent and rate of recent glacial change. The study will produce a climate record for the coastal low-elevation terrestrial region, which will refine the major climate shifts of up to 6 degrees C in the recent past (last 12,000 years). A novel terrestrial record of the recent glacial history will provide insight into observed changes in climate and sea-ice dynamics in the western Antarctic Peninsula and allow for comparison with off-shore climate records captured in sediments. Observations and discoveries from this project will be disseminated to local schools and science centers. The project provides training and career development for a postdoctoral scientist as well as graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The research presents a new systematic survey to reconstruct ecosystem and climate change for the coastal low-elevation areas on the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) using proxy records preserved in late Holocene peat deposits. Moss and peat samples will be collected and analyzed to generate a comprehensive data set of late-Holocene climate change and ecosystem dynamics. The goal is to document and understand the transformations of landscape and terrestrial ecosystems on the western AP during the late Holocene. The testable hypothesis is that coastal regions have experienced greater climate variability than evidenced in ice-core records and that past warmth has facilitated dramatic ecosystem and cryosphere response. A primary product of the project is a robust reconstruction of late Holocene climate changes for coastal low-elevation terrestrial areas using multiple lines of evidence from peat-based biological and geochemical proxies, which will be used to compare with climate records derived from marine sediments and ice cores from the AP region. These data will be used to test several ideas related to novel peat-forming ecosystems (such as Antarctic hairgrass bogs) in past warmer climates and climate controls over ecosystem establishment and migration to help assess the nature of the Little Ice Age cooling and cryosphere response. The chronology of peat cores will be established by radiocarbon dating of macrofossils and Bayesian modeling. The high-resolution time series of ecosystem and climate changes will help put the observed recent changes into a long-term context to bridge climate dynamics over different time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information will be used to reconstruct plant life and environments during the Permian and Triassic (~295-205 million years ago) in Antarctica. This time interval is important to study as Antarctica experienced a large glaciation in the Permian followed by deglaciation and recovery of plant and animal life, only to be subjected to the largest extinction in Earth history at the end of the Permian. After the extinction events, the climate in Antarctica continued to warm extensively and there were forests growing close to the paleo-South Pole. These ancient environments provide a natural laboratory in which to study the effects of climate change on plant life. The results of this project will advance the field in the areas of changing sedimentary patterns during global cooling and warming, as well as plant evolution during times following glaciation and during global warmth. <br/><br/>This project will study the extent of the Gondwana glaciation in the SHK area, the invasion and subsequent flourishing of life following glacial retreat, and the eventual recovery of plant life after Late Permian extinction events. Only in Antarctica does a complete polar-to-near-polar succession occur across this climatic and biologic transition. The SHK area is an important one as it is one of the few regions in the world where the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is exposed within terrestrial rocks. The field and lab work for this project is organized around three hypotheses that address fundamental issues in Earth history, including changes in the extent and diversity of flora during the Permian build up to the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, the possible diachronous nature of the PTB, and that poor fossil preservation during the Early Triassic has given a false impression that Antarctica was devoid of plants during this time.  The hypotheses will be tested by integrating various types of paleobotanical approaches with detailed sedimentology, stratigraphy, and geochemistry.  Compression floras and petrified wood will be collected (constrained by stratigraphy) both quantitatively and qualitatively in order to obtain biodiversity and abundance data, and as a data source for paleoecological analysis. Standard sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses will be performed, as well as paleosol analyses, including mineralogic and major- and trace-element geochemistry. Collections will also be made for U-Pb zircon geochronology to better constrain geologic and biotic events through time. Results of the project will be incorporated into educational and outreach activities that are designed to include women and under-represented groups in the excitement of Antarctic earth sciences and paleontology, including workshops in Kansas and Wisconsin, as well as links to science classes during fieldwork."

Although larch is a fire-dependent tree species, previous research and that of others suggests that increased fire activity may limit larch forest recovery and potentially trigger forest loss and a shift to alternative vegetation dominated by shrubs or grasses. Forest loss could have large consequences for climate because of changes in C storage and reflection of heat and light (albedo). Larch forests occur across much of the Arctic latitudinal treeline, and future larch recruitment dynamics will be a primary determinant of whether boreal forests respond to climate warming via treeline migration. Despite the global importance of these forests and the potential for an altered fire regime to modify recruitment patterns and future forest cover, larch forests remain largely understudied compared to the boreal forests of North America. The many mechanisms governing post-fire larch recruitment and the consequences for system-level feedbacks to regional and global climate remain untested. This research will link constraints on larch forest recruitment after fire to system-wide observations of larch recruitment failure and associated feedbacks to climate.&#8232;<br/><br/>Boreal forests cover a large portion of the vegetated land area above the Arctic Circle and are a critical component of the Arctic System. In larch forests, increased fire activity associated with climate warming and drying can lead to larch recruitment failure, which in turn can limit forest recovery and trigger forest loss. A transition from forests to successional trajectories dominated by shrubs or grasses could have important consequences for climate feedbacks. The primary objective of this research is to delineate the causes of varying larch recruitment after fire and to quantify the consequences of larch recruitment failure for climate feedbacks via changes in C storage and albedo using a combination of field-based measurements, dendrochronological analysis, remotely-sensed data, and statistical modeling. The project hypothesizes that post-fire larch recruitment will be most constrained by seed sources (i.e., biological legacies) but that environmental conditions (e.g., soil organic layer depth) and biotic interactions (e.g., degree of mycorrhizal colonization and community structure) will impose secondary limitations on recruitment when seed sources are available. Larch recruitment failure will shift successional trajectories to those dominated by shrubs and grasses, resulting in reduced C storage, higher albedo, and cooling of regional climate. We will test hypotheses via field observations and experimental manipulations, combine field- derived data and statistical modeling to determine the factors that most influence larch recruitment, use high-resolution satellite imagery to determine the recent extent of regional larch recruitment failure after fire, and estimate C pools and albedo across gradients of larch recruitment and stand succession to determine the relative system-level consequences of changes in these parameters for regional climate forcing. By focusing on the mechanistic connections between fire and larch recruitment, the research will provide critical information on the net feedback of an intensified fire regime in arctic ecosystems to regional and global climate.&#8232;<br/><br/>This project will train about 16 undergraduate students, one MS student, three PhD students, and two post-doctoral scholars. It will provide support for four female scientists, two of whom are early-career. It will share results with researchers in Amsterdam for inclusion in a circumpolar map of fire activity and forest recruitment, further improving international collaborations. Research findings will be widely disseminated to the scientific community through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national conference, and professional seminars. PIs will develop and lead a workshop aimed at improving middle school teachers' understanding of climate change science and their ability to effectively teach climate science to students."

The project hypothesizes that post-fire larch recruitment will be most constrained by seed sources (i.e., biological legacies) but that environmental conditions (e.g., soil organic layer depth) and biotic interactions (e.g., degree of mycorrhizal colonization and community structure) will impose secondary limitations on recruitment when seed sources are available. Larch recruitment failure will shift successional trajectories to those dominated by shrubs and grasses, resulting in reduced C storage, higher albedo, and cooling of regional climate. We will test hypotheses via field observations and experimental manipulations, combine field- derived data and statistical modeling to determine the factors that most influence larch recruitment, use high-resolution satellite imagery to determine the recent extent of regional larch recruitment failure after fire, and estimate C pools and albedo across gradients of larch recruitment and stand succession to determine the relative system-level consequences of changes in these parameters for regional climate forcing. By focusing on the mechanistic connections between fire and larch recruitment, the research will provide critical information on the net feedback of an intensified fire regime in arctic ecosystems to regional and global climate.&#8232;<br/><br/>This project will train about 16 undergraduate students, one MS student, three PhD students, and two post-doctoral scholars. It will provide support for four female scientists, two of whom are early-career. It will share results with researchers in Amsterdam for inclusion in a circumpolar map of fire activity and forest recruitment, further improving international collaborations. Research findings will be widely disseminated to the scientific community through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national conference, and professional seminars. PIs will develop and lead a workshop aimed at improving middle school teachers' understanding of climate change science and their ability to effectively teach climate science to students."

Many of these are recorded in the marine sediments, but sedimentation rates are so small that the time series that can be estimated from them only resolve changes that occur on decadal time scales or longer.  When clams and other bivalves grow, they incorporate, in their shells, geochemical signatures from the water in which they live.  They also lay down growth rings, like tree rings, in their shells.  By studying the chemistry of adjacent rings in long-lived clam shells the principal investigators (PIs) of this project expect to be able to reconstruct the annual temperature and salinity variations of near surface waters in a region offshore of northern Norway.  They will focus their efforts on the Medieval Warm Period (1000 AD to 1200 AD), the Little Ice Age (1200 AD to 1850 AD), and the modern era (1850 AD until the present).  The resultant histories of temperature and salinity variation will be useful for understanding how the ocean conditions changed during these known periods of climate variation and for validating or constraining climate models.<br/><br/>The PIs? immediate goal is to reconstruct annual hydrographic variability during key climate intervals within the last millennium along the strategically located Arctic islands of Ingoy and Rolvsoy. They will hindcast changes in annual sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). They will also establish the baseline variability in the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect. The modern near-surface oceanography along the islands is influenced by the physical properties of the Norwegian Coastal Current, while the relatively deep hydrographic conditions predominately depend on Atlantic inflow. Pilot data from the study site demonstrate a strong link between shell-based records and regional SST/SSS conditions. Hence, Ingoy and Rolvsoy seem situated in an ideal location to study marine climate change during the late Holocene. Hypotheses and objectives have been developed to test the relative influence of dominant climate modes on the regional oceanography near northern Norway during the last millennium.<br/>Objective 1: Develop near-surface annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) to reconstruct regional hydrographic variability (SST and SSS) along the northernmost coast of Norway during intervals of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and for Modern Climate.<br/>Objective 2: Develop relatively deep-water (200 m) annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) for the last 100 years to characterize the role of the North Atlantic Current on hydrography at the site.<br/>Objective 3: Establish a decadal record of the surface marine radiocarbon reservoir effect since AD 1600 to estimate changes in source water contributions at Ingoy.<br/>Objective 4: Estimate the relative influence of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation, the surface Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on regional hydrography (at Ingoy) and shell-based records.<br/><br/>An international partnership for studying Arctic marine climate change will be developed with colleagues from the Akvaplan-niva (Norway), Iowa State University (ISU) and Bates College (Maine). Outreach, public engagement, and dissemination of the results will be accomplished through engagement of two K-12 teachers in the field work, through classroom interactions with K-12 students, through a K-12 teacher workshop, through citizen-based science (via interactions with native Norwegians at Ingoy), and via a photo-journalist who will join the PIs for one field season. At least one female PhD student and approximately five undergraduate students will be supported by and involved with the project. The PIs will use data and ideas developed in this project for several courses at ISU and Bates College relating to climate change, paleoclimate and oceanography.

Although larch is a fire-dependent tree species, previous research and that of others suggests that increased fire activity may limit larch forest recovery and potentially trigger forest loss and a shift to alternative vegetation dominated by shrubs or grasses. Forest loss could have large consequences for climate because of changes in C storage and reflection of heat and light (albedo). Larch forests occur across much of the Arctic latitudinal treeline, and future larch recruitment dynamics will be a primary determinant of whether boreal forests respond to climate warming via treeline migration. Despite the global importance of these forests and the potential for an altered fire regime to modify recruitment patterns and future forest cover, larch forests remain largely understudied compared to the boreal forests of North America. The many mechanisms governing post-fire larch recruitment and the consequences for system-level feedbacks to regional and global climate remain untested.

It is critical that we continue to observe the Arctic during this time of rapid evolution to quantify the physical changes that are occurring, to better understand their causes, and to assess their impacts on the Arctic Ocean climate system.

This information will be used to reconstruct plant life and environments during the Permian and Triassic (~295-205 million years ago) in Antarctica. This time interval is important to study as Antarctica experienced a large glaciation in the Permian followed by deglaciation and recovery of plant and animal life, only to be subjected to the largest extinction in Earth history at the end of the Permian. After the extinction events, the climate in Antarctica continued to warm extensively and there were forests growing close to the paleo-South Pole. These ancient environments provide a natural laboratory in which to study the effects of climate change on plant life. The results of this project will advance the field in the areas of changing sedimentary patterns during global cooling and warming, as well as plant evolution during times following glaciation and during global warmth. <br/><br/>This project will study the extent of the Gondwana glaciation in the SHK area, the invasion and subsequent flourishing of life following glacial retreat, and the eventual recovery of plant life after Late Permian extinction events. Only in Antarctica does a complete polar-to-near-polar succession occur across this climatic and biologic transition. The SHK area is an important one as it is one of the few regions in the world where the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is exposed within terrestrial rocks. The field and lab work for this project is organized around three hypotheses that address fundamental issues in Earth history, including changes in the extent and diversity of flora during the Permian build up to the Late Paleozoic Ice Age, the possible diachronous nature of the PTB, and that poor fossil preservation during the Early Triassic has given a false impression that Antarctica was devoid of plants during this time.  The hypotheses will be tested by integrating various types of paleobotanical approaches with detailed sedimentology, stratigraphy, and geochemistry.  Compression floras and petrified wood will be collected (constrained by stratigraphy) both quantitatively and qualitatively in order to obtain biodiversity and abundance data, and as a data source for paleoecological analysis. Standard sedimentologic and stratigraphic analyses will be performed, as well as paleosol analyses, including mineralogic and major- and trace-element geochemistry. Collections will also be made for U-Pb zircon geochronology to better constrain geologic and biotic events through time. Results of the project will be incorporated into educational and outreach activities that are designed to include women and under-represented groups in the excitement of Antarctic earth sciences and paleontology, including workshops in Kansas and Wisconsin, as well as links to science classes during fieldwork."

Similar waves exist in abundance in the atmosphere, affecting many air layers and transporting enormous amount of energy and momentum over large distances; they also affect and sometimes trigger many weather related processes. These waves are called ""gravity waves""; they are key drivers of the air general circulation and temperature distributions throughout the middle and upper atmosphere. Studying gravity waves, their sources, generation mechanism and propagation properties, and dynamic characteristics is a matter of high importance for many scientific disciplines including atmospheric science, meteorology, climatology, space weather, and others. Developments in our knowledge and modeling of weather prediction and climate dynamics are of a highest societal importance. <br/><br/>Although the most significant effects of these gravity waves are best noticeable in the middle- and low latitudes, their generation and initial drivers are better studied from the polar regions. This research continues continent-wide observations of gravity waves in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica through the multinational research effort named ANGWIN (ANtarctic Gravity Wave Instrument Network) that uses state-of-the-art wide field cameras and  Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mappers (AMTM) deployed at various Antarctic stations. The proposed research adds new imagers to the U.S. stations at Palmer and at McMurdo, augmenting already existing instrumentation strategically distributed around the Antarctic continent at stations Halley and Rothera (UK), Comandante Ferraz (Brazil), Syowa (Japan), Davis (Australia), and at the U.S. stations McMurdo and South Pole. This will create an unprecedented capability for the pan-Antarctic investigations of gravity waves dynamics and their effects on the upper atmosphere. The project will bring new knowledge and better understanding of the continental-scale effects on the general air circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere, quantifying characteristics of mesospheric gravity waves, their dominant sources, propagation, and dissipation over the Antarctic continent and surrounding Southern Ocean. This research is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of the Geospace domain as the arrangement of installed and planned instrumentation will form a powerful observing system with a high potential for advancing this science field. The coordinated analysis of obtained images and data will be performed by the U.S. and international collaborator; data and results will be shared via a series of open workshops, facilitating discussions and assuring progress in understanding of important atmospheric phenomena."

Forest loss could have large consequences for climate because of changes in C storage and reflection of heat and light (albedo). Larch forests occur across much of the Arctic latitudinal treeline, and future larch recruitment dynamics will be a primary determinant of whether boreal forests respond to climate warming via treeline migration. Despite the global importance of these forests and the potential for an altered fire regime to modify recruitment patterns and future forest cover, larch forests remain largely understudied compared to the boreal forests of North America. The many mechanisms governing post-fire larch recruitment and the consequences for system-level feedbacks to regional and global climate remain untested. This research will link constraints on larch forest recruitment after fire to system-wide observations of larch recruitment failure and associated feedbacks to climate.&#8232;<br/><br/>Boreal forests cover a large portion of the vegetated land area above the Arctic Circle and are a critical component of the Arctic System. In larch forests, increased fire activity associated with climate warming and drying can lead to larch recruitment failure, which in turn can limit forest recovery and trigger forest loss. A transition from forests to successional trajectories dominated by shrubs or grasses could have important consequences for climate feedbacks. The primary objective of this research is to delineate the causes of varying larch recruitment after fire and to quantify the consequences of larch recruitment failure for climate feedbacks via changes in C storage and albedo using a combination of field-based measurements, dendrochronological analysis, remotely-sensed data, and statistical modeling. The project hypothesizes that post-fire larch recruitment will be most constrained by seed sources (i.e., biological legacies) but that environmental conditions (e.g., soil organic layer depth) and biotic interactions (e.g., degree of mycorrhizal colonization and community structure) will impose secondary limitations on recruitment when seed sources are available. Larch recruitment failure will shift successional trajectories to those dominated by shrubs and grasses, resulting in reduced C storage, higher albedo, and cooling of regional climate. We will test hypotheses via field observations and experimental manipulations, combine field- derived data and statistical modeling to determine the factors that most influence larch recruitment, use high-resolution satellite imagery to determine the recent extent of regional larch recruitment failure after fire, and estimate C pools and albedo across gradients of larch recruitment and stand succession to determine the relative system-level consequences of changes in these parameters for regional climate forcing. By focusing on the mechanistic connections between fire and larch recruitment, the research will provide critical information on the net feedback of an intensified fire regime in arctic ecosystems to regional and global climate.&#8232;<br/><br/>This project will train about 16 undergraduate students, one MS student, three PhD students, and two post-doctoral scholars. It will provide support for four female scientists, two of whom are early-career. It will share results with researchers in Amsterdam for inclusion in a circumpolar map of fire activity and forest recruitment, further improving international collaborations. Research findings will be widely disseminated to the scientific community through publications in scientific journals, presentations at national conference, and professional seminars. PIs will develop and lead a workshop aimed at improving middle school teachers' understanding of climate change science and their ability to effectively teach climate science to students."

While much attention is focused on the ongoing rapid changes at the coastal margin of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, obtaining records of past ice-sheet and climate change is the only way to constrain how an ice sheet changes over millennial timescales. Whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during the last interglacial period (~130,000 to 116,000 years ago), when temperatures were slightly warmer than today, remains a major unsolved problem in Antarctic glaciology. Hercules Dome is an ice divide located at the intersection of the East Antarctic and West Antarctic ice sheets. It is ideally situated to record the glaciological and climatic effects of changes in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This project will establish whether Hercules Dome experienced major changes in flow due to changes in the elevation of the two ice sheets. The project will also ascertain whether Hercules Domes is a suitable site from which to recover climate records from the last interglacial period.  These records could be used to determine whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during that period. The project will support two early-career researchers and train students at the University of Washington. Results will be communicated through outreach programs in coordination the Ice Drilling Project Office, the University of Washington's annual Polar Science Weekend in Seattle, and art-science collaboration.<br/><br/>This project will develop a history of ice dynamics at the intersection of the East and West Antarctic ice sheets, and ascertain whether the site is suitable for a deep ice-coring operation.  Ice divides provide a unique opportunity to assess the stability of past ice flow.  The low deviatoric stresses and non-linearity of ice flow causes an arch (a ""Raymond Bump"") in the internal layers beneath a stable ice divide.  This information can be used to determine the duration of steady ice flow. Due to the slow horizontal ice-flow velocities, ice divides also preserve old ice with internal layering that reflects past flow conditions caused by divide migration. Hercules Dome is an ice divide that is well positioned to retain information of past variations in the geometry of both the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. This dome is also the most promising location at which to recover an ice core that can be used to determine whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapsed during the last interglacial period. Limited ice-penetrating radar data collected along a previous scientific surface traverse indicate well-preserved englacial stratigraphy and evidence suggestive of a Raymond Bump, but the previous survey was not sufficiently extensive to allow thorough characterization or determination of past changes in ice dynamics. This project will conduct a dedicated survey to map the englacial stratigraphy and subglacial topography as well as basal properties at Hercules Dome. The project will use ground-based ice-penetrating radar to 1) image internal layers and the ice-sheet basal interface, 2) accurately measure englacial attenuation, and 3) determine englacial vertical strain rates. The radar data will be combined with GPS observations for detailed topography and surface velocities and ice-flow modeling to constrain the basal characteristics and the history of past ice flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antarctic minke whales are the largest ice-obligate krill predator in the region, yet- little is known about their foraging behavior and ecology.  The goals of the project are to use a suite of new technological tools to measure the underwater behavior of the whales and better understand how they exploit the sea ice habitat.  Using video-recording motion-sensing tags, the underwater movements of the whales can be reconstructed and it can be determine where and when they feed.  UAS (unmanned aerial systems) will be used to generate real-time images of sea ice cover that will be linked with tag data to determine how much time whales spend in sea ice versus open water, and how the behavior of the whales changes between these two habitats.  Lastly, scientific echosounders will be used to characterize the prey field that the whales are exploiting and differences in krill availability inside and out of the ice will be investigated.  All of this information is critical to understand the ecological role of Antarctic minke whales so that better predictions can be made regarding impacts of climate change not only on these animals, but on the structure and function of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.  <br/>The project will promote the progress of science by elucidating the ecological role of a poorly known Antarctic predator and using this information to better understand the impact of changes that are occurring in Polar Regions.  The educational and outreach program will increase awareness and understanding of minke whales, Antarctic marine ecosystems, sea ice, and the dynamics of climate change through the use of film, social media, and curriculum development for formal STEM educators.<br/><br/>To understand how changes in sea ice will manifest in the demography of predators that rely on sea ice habitat requires knowledge of their behavior and ecology.  The largest ice-dependent krill predator and most abundant cetacean in the Southern Ocean is the Antarctic minke whale (AMW)- yet, virtually nothing is known of its foraging behavior or ecological role.  Thus, the knowledge to understand how climate-driven changes will affect these animals and therefore the dynamics of the ecosystem as a whole is lacking. The project will use multi-sensor and video recording tags, fisheries acoustics, and unmanned aerial systems to study the foraging behavior and ecological role of minke whales in the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula.  The following research questions will be posed:<br/>1. What is the feeding performance of AMWs?<br/>2. How important is sea ice to the foraging behavior of AMW?<br/>3. How do AMWs feed directly under sea ice?<br/>Proven tagging and analytical approaches to characterize the underwater feeding behavior and kinematics of minke whales will be used.  Combined with quantitative measurements of the prey field, the energetic costs of feeding will be measured and it will be determined how minke whales optimize energy gain.  Using animal-borne video recording tags and UAS technology it will also be determined how much feeding occurs directly under sea ice and how this mode differs from open water feeding.  This knowledge will: (1) significantly enhance knowledge of the least-studied Antarctic krill predator; and (2) be made directly available to international, long-term efforts to understand how climate-driven changes will affect the structure and function of the Antarctic marine ecosystem.<br/>The educational and outreach efforts aim to increase awareness and understanding of: (i) the ecological role of minke whales around the Antarctic Peninsula; (ii) the effects of environmental change on an abundant but largely unstudied marine predator; (iii) the advanced methods and technologies used by whale researchers to study these cryptic animals and their prey; and (iv) the variety of careers in the ocean sciences by sharing the experiences of scientists and students.  These educational aims will be achieved by delivering continuous near-real-time delivery of project events and data to informal audiences through social media channels as well as curricula and professional development programs that will provide formal STEM educators with specific standards-compliant lesson plans."

Many of these are recorded in the marine sediments, but sedimentation rates are so small that the time series that can be estimated from them only resolve changes that occur on decadal time scales or longer.  When clams and other bivalves grow, they incorporate, in their shells, geochemical signatures from the water in which they live.  They also lay down growth rings, like tree rings, in their shells.  By studying the chemistry of adjacent rings in long-lived clam shells the principal investigators (PIs) of this project expect to be able to reconstruct the annual temperature and salinity variations of near surface waters in a region offshore of northern Norway.  They will focus their efforts on the Medieval Warm Period (1000 AD to 1200 AD), the Little Ice Age (1200 AD to 1850 AD), and the modern era (1850 AD until the present).  The resultant histories of temperature and salinity variation will be useful for understanding how the ocean conditions changed during these known periods of climate variation and for validating or constraining climate models.<br/><br/>The PIs? immediate goal is to reconstruct annual hydrographic variability during key climate intervals within the last millennium along the strategically located Arctic islands of Ingoy and Rolvsoy. They will hindcast changes in annual sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS). They will also establish the baseline variability in the marine radiocarbon reservoir effect. The modern near-surface oceanography along the islands is influenced by the physical properties of the Norwegian Coastal Current, while the relatively deep hydrographic conditions predominately depend on Atlantic inflow. Pilot data from the study site demonstrate a strong link between shell-based records and regional SST/SSS conditions. Hence, Ingoy and Rolvsoy seem situated in an ideal location to study marine climate change during the late Holocene. Hypotheses and objectives have been developed to test the relative influence of dominant climate modes on the regional oceanography near northern Norway during the last millennium.<br/>Objective 1: Develop near-surface annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) to reconstruct regional hydrographic variability (SST and SSS) along the northernmost coast of Norway during intervals of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and for Modern Climate.<br/>Objective 2: Develop relatively deep-water (200 m) annual shell-based records (master shell chronology and isotopes) for the last 100 years to characterize the role of the North Atlantic Current on hydrography at the site.<br/>Objective 3: Establish a decadal record of the surface marine radiocarbon reservoir effect since AD 1600 to estimate changes in source water contributions at Ingoy.<br/>Objective 4: Estimate the relative influence of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation, the surface Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on regional hydrography (at Ingoy) and shell-based records.<br/><br/>An international partnership for studying Arctic marine climate change will be developed with colleagues from the Akvaplan-niva (Norway), Iowa State University (ISU) and Bates College (Maine). Outreach, public engagement, and dissemination of the results will be accomplished through engagement of two K-12 teachers in the field work, through classroom interactions with K-12 students, through a K-12 teacher workshop, through citizen-based science (via interactions with native Norwegians at Ingoy), and via a photo-journalist who will join the PIs for one field season. At least one female PhD student and approximately five undergraduate students will be supported by and involved with the project. The PIs will use data and ideas developed in this project for several courses at ISU and Bates College relating to climate change, paleoclimate and oceanography. PI Wanamaker will facilitate a public lecture series on climate change at the Ames Public library and continue to act as co-chair of Edwards Elementary Science Night, which has impacted > 1,000 students and community members since 2012."

Specifically, this project prompts collaborative engagements with the increasing challenges to fossil fuel development in northern Alaska, including: eroding coastlines, petroleum-dependent subsistence activities, plans for new offshore drilling, dwindling dividends,and unprecedented environmental shifts. Seeking to involve Native communities within wider conversations across research and policy around these concerns, this project is inspired by innovative community efforts to secure subsistence, insure wellbeing, and create viable cultural futures in a context of rapid change. By building a unique regional research alliance around these insights, the project also aimsto revise common understandings about some of the most pressing topics of our times, including health and wellness, inequality, changing ecosystems, and the prospects of a petroleum-based social contract in Alaska.This project will directly benefit partner communities, science and scientific communities, policy-makers and efforts to strengthen American democracy.<br/><br/>The project makes three primary contributions to publicly relevantsocial scienceresearch focused on Arctic futures. First, it develops a collaborative method that empowers Alaska Native community research partners to design, coordinate, and implement research questions and activities within their own communities. Second, a decolonizing methodology endeavorsto rethink theanalytic lexiconsof Arcticsocial science research, andthus torevise scholarly approaches to some of the biggest issues of the present, including the ways that knowledge about Arctic futures is negotiated and co-produced. Finally, this project maximizes the broader impacts of this knowledge by laying the foundation for a wider research network that brings Indigenous and scientific insights to bear on the most critical public problems in northern Alaska today. Findings from the study will also advance conversations in several bodies of scholarship concerned with decolonizing methodologies, shifting Arctic ecologies and economies, and Indigenous wellbeing. In such ways, the project will engage current debates by creating a more inclusive exploration of the Arctic and its open-ended futures. "

Its stability under projected warming scenarios is inextricably linked with future global sea level rise. There have been only modest ground based atmospheric science or climatological field observations collected in West Antarctica since that undertaken during the era of the 1957 International Geophysical Year. Satellite imagery and meteorological reanalysis indicate that West Antarctica is highly susceptible to continental advection of warm and moist maritime air and cloud cover, depending on the location and strength of climatological low pressure cells in the Amundsen, Ross, and Bellingshausen Seas. There is a need to quantify the role of these changing air masses have on the surface energy balance, including radiation components and cloud radiative forcing terms, and to identify distant teleconnections with lower latitudes, such as the North Atlantic and the tropics. <br/><br/>The research proposed herein, at McMurdo and at WAIS divide, is organized in two thrusts: (1) Empirical determination of the energy balance on the WAIS divide site throughout a 75-day (austral summer) observing period, accounting for meteorological factors governing the local energy balance, and including exploration of teleconnections with lower latitudes, and, (2) Determination of the major categories of meteorological conditions that give rise to recurring types of cloud cover, including mixed phase clouds, and aerosol abundance over Ross Island, over an annual cycle. These measurement campaigns will be organized around the detailed protocols and advanced observing facilities enabled by the DOE ARM mobile facility (Department of Energy ? Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program). These extensive and advanced ARM microphysical data will also be used to assess how well current polar-optimized regional climate models simulate observed high latitude cloud cover.<br/><br/>The AWARE campaign also will provide a hands-on opportunity to help high school teachers adapt to the new Next Generation Science and Engineering Standards (NGSS).

As such, the properties of these water masses can be used as valuable markers of past climate, while future changes to them would be compelling signals of an Arctic climate in transition. This proposal seeks to investigate the origins and history of the deepest waters through analysis of existing data sets and idealized numerical modeling.  Such understanding is essential to understand how the deep waters of the Arctic Ocean participate in climate change.  <br/><br/>This project will address several interrelated observational and dynamical questions: What constrains the evolution of heat and salt in the deep water? How is the deep water influenced by the rest of the Arctic Ocean? What past ocean conditions and mechanisms allowed for the formation of the deep water, and what climate shift may have prompted an end to ventilation of the bottom waters? These aspects of the climate system will be investigated by dynamical process studies constrained by analyses of recent ocean measurements from moored instruments and icebreaker surveys.<br/><br/>This project comprises an integrated research, education, and outreach program that implements a tiered mentoring approach to provide experience in Arctic climate research for scholars from high school to postdoctoral level. Education and outreach integrates with Yale University?s well-established Pathways to Science infrastructure: high school students (over half of whom are from traditionally underrepresented groups) will be introduced to Arctic climate science through lectures and laboratory demonstrations, while graduate students will receive teaching and mentoring experience. The project generates opportunities for independent climate research appropriate to a range of skillsets and interests, with high school students being recruited concurrently with undergraduate students for summer research internships. Through an international partnership with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS), undergraduate and graduate students will be introduced to the Arctic environment, learning fundamental concepts of the Arctic climate system through lectures and participating in fieldwork. Students will deploy innovative Arctic instrumentation in the fjords of Svalbard and will then process and interpret the measurements. In collaboration with the Yale Climate and Energy Institute (YCEI) and the International Arctic Science Committee, an international workshop, motivated by the central theme of the proposed research, will bring together researchers across a range of disciplines (including anthropologists, paleoceanographers and contemporary climate scientists) to explore the important relationships between culture and Arctic climate change over the past millennia."

One way to understand the composition and nature of the Earth's mantle is by studying the chemistry of basalts, which originate by volcanic eruptions of partially melting mantle rocks.  This study will establish the budget and distribution of volatile elements (hydrogen, carbon, fluorine, chlorine, sulfur) in volcanic basalts to better understand the composition of the Earth's interior.  Volatiles influence mantle melting, magma crystallization, magma migration and volcanic eruptions.  Their abundances and spatial distribution provide important constraints on models of mantle flow and temperature. Moreover, volatiles are key constituents of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.  Establishing the cycles of volatiles between the Earth's interior and surface is of fundamental importance to understand the long-term evolution of our planet.  This project supports a graduate student and research scientist at Brown University. It promotes the collaboration with geochemists from eleven institutions representing six different countries: USA, Germany, United Kingdom, Argentina, South Korea and Japan, and utilizes several NSF-funded USA analytical facilities.  Communication of results will occur through: 1) peer-reviewed journals, presentations at conferences and invited university lectures, 2) hands-on science learning activities for local elementary and high school classes, and 3) outreach to the general audience through public lectures.<br/><br/>Over the last 60 years of funded research, the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby ocean ridges have been extensively investigated providing information on the origin of the magmatism, and the composition, structure, temperature and evolution of the lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle. Diverse hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the magmatism in the Antarctic Peninsula, from flux melting of the mantle wedge during devolatilization of the subducted Phoenix plate, to adiabatic decompression melting of a carbonated and hydrous asthenosphere, to melting of a volatile-rich metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle. All proposed hypotheses invoke the role of volatiles. Surprisingly, data on the volatile contents of basalts and mantle from this region are non-existent. This is a significant omission from the geochemical data set, given the important role volatile elements play in the generation and composition of magmas and their sources. The focus of our research is to examine the regional variations in volatile contents (C, H, F, S, Cl) in geochemically well-characterized Pliocene-recent basalts from the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge. Our goal is to establish the budget and distribution of volatiles in the mantle to understand 1) the processes responsible for the generation of chemically diverse basalts in close spatial and temporal proximity and 2) the nature (lithology, composition and temperature) of the heterogeneous mantle source beneath the Antarctic Peninsula and Phoenix ridge."

Activities include a combination of (i) field work in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas through collaboration with a Japanese research program, (ii) the development of optically-based algorithms for discerning planktonic community assemblages, and (iii) application of these algorithms to satellite remote-sensing data. The field work will include observations of planktonic community structure and connect these to seawater optical properties in the study area at different seasonal time periods. In addition, the investigators will use phytoplankton pigment measurements to infer spatial patterns of planktonic community composition and address the hypothesis that optical measurements can identify distinct planktonic assemblages. Finally, the project will develop and validate algorithms relating seawater optical properties to planktonic community structure and apply these to a time series of ocean color imagery to generate spatial maps of plankton community composition within the surface ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will document the cultural histories, social interactions, population diversity and dispersal, and environmental changes from data collected at Cape Espenberg and in relation to the greater Bering Strait and Arctic regions.  The research team will work together with community members in Shishmaref to conduct archaeological excavation, paleoecology and ancient DNA research to better understand who were the people that first settled the area around AD 1000, when and from where they came, and in what environmental conditions these events took place. At the same time they will work with cultural advisers and Shishmaref community members who have ancestral ties to the area to explore how material culture and landscape is interpreted to talk about the past and tell history.  The project will promote progress of science and education by conducting basic research and developing new methods in the several research fields involved. By insuring and promoting proper conservation of artifacts the project, will increase awareness and capacity to preserve the growing catalog of perishable organic artifacts, increasingly exposed due to eroding coastal and thawing permafrost. By including indigenous perspectives on material culture, the research will promote an archaeology that is more receptive to multiple voices. The project will also foster national and international collaborations between four US research institutes, a French University (U. of Panthon Sorbonne), a rural Alaska community and a regional non-profit corporation. Associated with the project a variety of initiatives represent opportunities in research, education and training for a number of underrepresented Alaska minorities, women, and undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The aims of this multidisciplinary program of research is to explore human interaction, settlement history, climate and landscape dynamics in relation to the Birnirk archaeological complex at ca. AD 1000. After a period of hiatus, Birnirk site KTZ-304 at Cape Espenberg (Inuigniq) was occupied at a pivotal cultural and environmental moment in Northwest Alaska and the larger Bering Sea region, just before AD 1000 and prior to the emergence of Inupiaq culture around AD 1300. Cape Espenberg is a key location for this cultural history both because of the presence of Ipiutak, Birnik and Thule archaeological sites and as ancestral land of today's Kigiqtaamiut of Shishmaref. Interrelated and integrated analytical approaches involving cultural and physical anthropology, archaeology and paleoecology will (a) form the framework for continued excavation at site KTZ-304 (b) contribute to study architectural features, archaeofauna, ceramics, and artifacts in order to elucidate social networks, subsistence systems and technology, and to understand the impact of climate and resource availability on peoples activities, decisions and movements; (c) guide the collecting of paleoenvironmental data through targeted sampling of swales and ridges to date dune ridge stabilization, reconstruct terrestrial vegetation and map the location of the ocean relative to the site; (d) integrate ancient DNA (aDNA) studies to establish the broader genetic relationships of Inuit societies in the region and beyond; (e) explore how Kigiqtaamiut interpret material culture to understand the past, narrate history and generate knowledge (f) foster a dialog on the role of material culture today in the community of Shishmaref and in between the Kigiqtaamiut and the scientists to construct more reflexive interpretations of the past, and thus (g) advance understanding of the origin of Inupiaq culture through the development of a high-resolution chronology of settlement and landscape formation, cultural shift and climate variation."

The writer will use the southern ocean experience as the setting for a poster and a book about the proposed research and the scientists studying extreme environments.  <br/><br/>The project will examine (1) the extent to which the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters influences the composition and diversity of bacterial and protistan assemblages; (2) conversely, whether the composition and diversity of southern ocean protistan and bacterial assemblages influence the magnitude and rates of DMSP cycling; (3) the expression of DMSP degradation genes by marine bacteria seasonally and in response to additions of DMSP; and, to synthesize these results by quantifying (4) the microbial networks resulting from the presence of DMSP-producers and DMSP-consumers along with their predators, all involved in the cycling of DMSP in southern ocean waters. The work will be accomplished by conducting continuous growth experiments with DMSP-amended natural samples during field sampling of different microbial communities present in summer and fall. Data from the molecular (such as 16S/ 18S tag sequences, DMSP-cycle gene transcripts) and biogeochemical (such as biogenic sulfur cycling, bacterial production, microbial biomass) investigations will be integrated via network analysis."

In hot years, studies have shown that glaciers move relatively slow, as meltwater infiltrating the glacier form large subglacial rivers, that deprive the basal surface of meltwater.  However, it is difficult to make long-term predictions of glacier behavior from existing, short datasets, because we know the way a glacier responds to meltwater reaching the bed can change. This research will develop a unique long-term dataset to investigate how the speed and pattern of water-mediated glacier motion changes as a glacier?s shape and plumbing system adjust to a changing climate. The work will allow better prediction of future glacier change and enhance understanding of how glaciers shape landscapes over geologic time. We will train undergraduate and graduate students in field and laboratory research practices, preparing them for careers in science. We will partner with a documentary filmmaker and Jasper National Park (Alberta, Canada), which hosts our field site, to develop educational materials that will show park visitors the importance of glaciers and scientific research to human society.<br/><br/>Understanding centennial scale changes in basal motion is essential for predicting how the world?s glaciers will respond to climate warming, with implications for sea level rise and downstream habitat quality and water resources.

We will collect borehole inclinometry and water pressure, glacier surface velocity, radar-based ice thickness, and hydrometeorological data, among other field-based and remotely sensed observations.

Exceptions include rare catastrophic events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods that occur on short timescales. Many significant processes that affect the land and landscape that we inhabit operate on time scales imperceptible to humans. One of these processes is wind transport of sand, with related impacts to exposed rock surfaces and man-made objects, including buildings, windshields, solar panels and wind-farm turbine blades. The goal of this project is to gain an understanding of wind erosion processes over long timescales, in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, a cold desert environment where there were no competing processes (such as rain and vegetation) that might mask the effects.  The main objective is recovery of rock samples that were deployed in 1983/1984 at 11 locations in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, along with measurements on the rock samples and characterization of the sites. In the late 1980's and early 1990's some of these samples were returned and indicated more time was needed to accumulate information about the timescales and impacts of the wind erosion processes. This project will allow collection of the remaining samples from this experiment after 30 to 31 years of exposure.  The field work will be carried out during the 2014/15 Austral summer.  The results will allow direct measurement of the abrasion rate and hence the volumes and timescales of sand transport; this will conclude the longest direct examination of such processes ever conducted.  Appropriate scaling of the results may be applied to buildings, vegetation (crops), and other aspects of human presence in sandy and windy locations, in order to better determine the impact of these processes and possible mitigation of the impacts. The project is a collaborative effort between a small business, Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS), and the University of Washington (UW). MSSS will highlight this Antarctic research on its web site, by developing thematic presentations describing our research and providing a broad range of visual materials. The public will be engaged through daily updates on a website and through links to material prepared for viewing in Google Earth.  UW students will be involved in the laboratory work and in the interpretation of the results.<br/><br/>Technical Description of Project:<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study the role of wind abrasion by entrained particles in the evolution of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in the Transantarctic Mountains. During the 1983 to 1984 field seasons, over 5000 rock targets were installed at five heights facing the 4 cardinal directions at 10 locations (with an additional site containing fewer targets) to study rates of physical weathering due primarily to eolian abrasion. In addition, rock cubes and cylinders were deployed at each site to examine effects of chemical weathering. The initial examination of samples returned after 1, 5, and 10 years of exposure, showed average contemporary abrasion rates consistent with those determined by cosmogenic isotope studies, but further stress that ""average"" should not be interpreted as meaning ""uniform.""  The samples will be characterized using mass measurements wtih 0.01 mg precision balances, digital microphotography to compare the evolution of their surface features and textures, SEM imaging to examine the micro textures of abraded rock surfaces, and optical microscopy of thin sections of a few samples to examine the consequences of particle impacts extending below the abraded surfaces. As much as 60-80% of the abrasion measured in samples from 1984-1994 appears to have occurred during a few brief hours in 1984. This is consistent with theoretical models that suggest abrasion scales as the 5th power of wind velocity. The field work will allow return of multiple samples after three decades of exposure, which will provide a statistical sampling (beyond what is acquired by studying a single sample), and will yield the mass loss data in light of complementary environmental and sand kinetic energy flux data from other sources (e.g. LTER meteorology stations). This study promises to improve insights into one of the principal active geomorphic process in the Dry Valleys, an important cold desert environment, and the solid empirical database will provide general constraints on eolian abrasion under natural conditions."

Albedo feedback, however, is actually composed of multiple mechanisms operating on timescales ranging from hours to millennia, both within snowpack and via altered cryospheric cover. This project aims to fill crucial gaps in our understanding of: 1) how light-absorbing impurities like black carbon (BC) influence albedo feedback via their effect on snow metamorphism, and 2) sources of decadal to multi-decadal variability in albedo feedback and explanation of why climate models universally underestimate 1979?2008 boreal albedo feedback (by ~2-fold) relative to remote sensing observations. Motivation for goal (1) arises from radiative modeling and observations showing that BC perturbs visible albedo more in coarser-grained (aged) snow, which is also darker in the near-infrared spectrum, indicating that BC triggers at least two positive albedo feedback mechanisms when it accelerates snow metamorphism. The influence of impurity heating on metamorphism, however, is uncertain. The PI will measure the evolution of snow effective grain size in snowpacks generated with and without BC, using a new near-infrared optical sensing device, to determine BC influence on metamorphism in one environment. Goal (2) is motivated by the observed bias in model feedback and a preliminary analysis showing large multi-decadal feedback variability in transient climate simulations. To isolate contributions to albedo feedback and identify causes of model-observation discrepancy and multi- decadal variability in feedback, he will incorporate diagnostic cryosphere radiative forcing terms into the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM) and conduct additional analyses with remote sensing and climate model data. Expectation of a long-term decline in albedo feedback associated with reduced cryospheric cover prompts the questions: Has albedo feedback peaked? If not, when might it, and why? Attaining the project objectives will enable modeling albedo feedback more consistently across scales, quantifying climate and hydrological influences of anthropogenic aerosol emissions more confidently, and providing a mechanistic explanation for the timing of peak albedo feedback in a warming world.<br/><br/>Research will be tightly integrated with undergraduate and graduate education. Snow impurity/metamorphism experiments and optical measurements will be part of a weekend research experience designed for freshmen at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). Students will gain exposure to winter field methods, instrumentation, measurements of energy and trace gas fluxes at station towers, and data interpretation. Student teams will deploy on Lake Douglas and other terrain at UMBS to measure snow properties and characterize spatial variability in grain size. This activity will be targeted toward early undergraduate students to influence degree major choices and interest in science career paths. Participating seniors may design, build, and apply field instruments for engineering course credit. Graduate studies of cryosphere?climate interactions will be incorporated into a course project in one of the PI?s courses. <br/><br/>The fundamental research resulting from this project will enhance understanding of important climate feedback processes, how industrial emissions influence these processes, and how they may impact water resources.  The integration of this research with educational activities will contribute to the training of the next generation of geoscientists and engineers."

Thwaites and neighboring glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are rapidly losing mass in response to recent climate warming and related changes in ocean circulation. Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment could lead to the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising the global sea level by up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in as short as 500 years. The processes driving the loss appear to be warmer ocean circulation and changes in the width and flow speed of the glacier, but a better understanding of these changes is needed to refine predictions of how the glacier will evolve. One highly sensitive process is the transitional flow of glacier ice from land onto the ocean to become a floating ice shelf. This flow of ice from grounded to floating is affected by changes in air temperature and snowfall at the surface; the speed and thickness of ice feeding it from upstream; and the ocean temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and currents that the ice flows into. The project team will gather new measurements of each of these local environmental conditions so that it can better predict how future changes in air, ocean, or the ice will affect the loss of ice to the ocean in this region.  <br/>  <br/>Current and anticipated near-future mass loss from Thwaites Glacier and nearby Amundsen Sea Embayment region is mainly attributed to reduction in ice-shelf buttressing due to sub-ice-shelf melting by intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water into sub-ice-shelf cavities. Such predictions for mass loss, however, still lack understanding of the dominant processes at and near grounding zones, especially their spatial and temporal variability, as well as atmospheric and oceanic drivers of these processes. This project aims to constrain and compare these processes for the Thwaites and the Dotson Ice Shelves, which are connected through upstream ice dynamics, but influenced by different submarine troughs. The team's specific objectives are to: 1) install atmosphere-ice-ocean multi-sensor remote autonomous stations on the ice shelves for two years to provide sub-daily continuous observations of concurrent oceanic, glaciologic, and atmospheric conditions; 2) measure ocean properties on the continental shelf adjacent to ice-shelf fronts (using seal tagging, glider-based and ship-based surveys, and existing moored and conductivity-temperature-depth-cast data), 3) measure ocean properties into sub-ice-shelf cavities (using autonomous underwater vehicles) to detail ocean transports and heat fluxes; and 4) constrain current ice-shelf and sub-ice-shelf cavity geometry, ice flow, and firn properties for the ice-shelves (using radar, active-source seismic, and gravimetric methods) to better understand the impact of ocean and atmosphere on the ice-sheet change.  The team will also engage the public and bring awareness to this rapidly changing component of the cryosphere through a ""Live from the Ice"" social media campaign in which the public can follow the action and data collection from the perspective of tagged seals and autonomous stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Canyon-associated biological hotspots have persisted for thousands of years Along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, despite significant climate variability. Observations of currents over Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, indicate that surface phytoplankton blooms enter and exit the local hotspot on scales of ~1-2 days. This time of residence is in conflict with the prevailing idea that canyon associated hotspots are primarily maintained by phytoplankton that are locally grown in association with these features by the upwelling of deep waters rich with nutrients that fuel the phytoplankton growth. Instead, the implication is that horizontal ocean circulation is likely more important to maintaining these biological hotspots than local upwelling through its physical concentrating effects. This project seeks to better resolve the factors that create and maintain focused areas of biological activity at canyons along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and create local foraging areas for marine mammals and birds. The project focus is in the analysis of the ocean transport and concentration mechanisms that sustain these biological hotspots, connecting oceanography to phytoplankton and krill, up through the food web to one of the resident predators, penguins. In addition, the research will engage with teachers from school districts serving underrepresented and underserved students by integrating the instructors and their students completely with the science team. Students will conduct their own research with the same data over the same time as researchers on the project. Revealing the fundamental mechanisms that sustain these known hotspots will significantly advance our understanding of the observed connection between submarine canyons and persistent penguin population hotspots over ecological time, and provide a new model for how Antarctic hotspots function.<br/> <br/> <br/>To understand the physical mechanisms that support persistent hotspots along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), this project will integrate a modeling and field program that will target the processes responsible for transporting and concentrating phytoplankton and krill biomass to known penguin foraging locations. Within the Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot, the team will deploy a High Frequency Radar (HFR) coastal surface current mapping network, uniquely equipped to identify the eddies and frontal regions that concentrate phytoplankton and krill. The field program, centered on surface features identified by the HFR, will include (i) a coordinated fleet of gliders to survey hydrography, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and active acoustics at the scale of the targeted convergent features; (ii) precise penguin tracking with GPS-linked satellite telemetry and time-depth recorders (TDRs); (iii) and weekly small boat surveys that adaptively target and track convergent features to measure phytoplankton, krill, and hydrography.

The retreat of Totten Glacier has global significance as the glacier drains a sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by as much as 3.5 meters. This study looks to determine the influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glaciers, including Totten Glacier, over the last ~18,000 years by studying seafloor sediment around Antarctica. These sediments, or muds, include the remains of microscopic marine organisms as well as tiny particles originating from eroded Antarctic bedrock. These muds provide a record of past environmental changes including ocean temperatures and the advance and retreat of glaciers. Scientists use a variety of physical and chemical analyses to determine how long ago this mud was deposited, the temperature of the ocean at that location through time, and the relative location of glacial ice. In this project, researchers will refine and test new methods for measuring ocean temperature from the sediments to better understand the influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glacier response. Results will be integrated into ice sheet and climate models to improve the accuracy of ice sheet modeling efforts and subsequent sea level predictions. Results from this project will be disseminated at scientific conferences, in the scientific literature, and more broadly to the general public via the St. Petersburg Science Festival and at the Oceanography Camp for Girls. <br/><br/>The influence of ocean temperatures on East Antarctic glaciers is largely unknown. This research focuses on ice-proximal Antarctic margin paleoceanographic proxy calibration and validation, which will improve understanding of past ocean-ice sheet interactions on a variety of timescales. In this project, researchers from the University of South Florida will (1) further develop and refine two ocean temperature proxies, foraminifer Mg/Ca and TEX86, for use in ice-proximal Antarctic continental margin sediments and (2) investigate deglacial to present (~18-0 ka) ocean-ice interactions at the outlet of the climatically sensitive Aurora Subglacial Basin. The proposed research utilizes sediment trap, sediment core, and physical oceanographic data previously collected from the Sabrina Coast continental shelf during NSF-funded cruise NBP14-02. Studies of existing sediment cores will integrate multiple paleotemperature, meltwater/salinity, nutrient, bottom water oxygen, and sea ice proxies with geophysical and lithologic data to understand past regional ocean-ice interactions. While the recent international Antarctic research focus has been on understanding the drivers of West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat, models suggest it would be imprudent to ignore the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is proving more sensitive to climate perturbations than previously realized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ethane is an abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere. The ice core samples that will be used in this analysis will span about 150 years before present to about 55,000 years before present and therefore, ethane emissions linked to human activities are not a subject of this study. The study will focus on quantifying the variability in the natural sources of ethane and the processes that govern its removal from the atmosphere. A long-term ice core ethane record will provide new knowledge on the chemistry of Earth?s atmosphere during time periods when human influence was either much smaller than present day or non-existent. The broader impacts of this work include education and training of students and a contribution to a better understanding of the chemistry of the atmosphere in the past and how it has been impacted by past changes in climate.<br/> <br/>Natural sources that emit ethane are both geologic (e.g. seeps, vents, mud volcanoes etc.) and pyrogenic (wild fires) which is commonly called biomass burning. Ethane is removed from the atmosphere via oxidation reactions. The ice core ethane measurements have great potential as a proxy for gaseous emissions from biomass burning. This is especially true for time periods preceding the industrial revolution when atmospheric variability of trace gases was largely controlled by natural processes. Another objective of this study is to improve understanding of the causes of atmospheric methane variability apparent which are in the existing ice core records. Methane is a simpler hydrocarbon than ethane and more abundant in the atmosphere. Even though the project does not include any methane measurements; the commonalities between the sources and removal of atmospheric ethane and methane mean that ethane measurements can be used to gain insight into the causes of changes in atmospheric methane levels. The broader impacts of the project include partial support for one Ph.D. student and support for undergraduate researchers at UC Irvine. The PIs group currently has 4 undergraduate researchers. The PI and the graduate students in the UCI ice core laboratory regularly participate in on- and off-campus activities such as laboratory tours and lectures directed towards educating high-school students and science teachers, and the local community at large about the scientific value of polar ice cores as an environmental record of our planet's past. The results of this research will be disseminated via peer-review publications and will contribute to policy-relevant activities such as the IPCC Climate Assessment. Data resulting from this project will be archived in a national data repository. This award does not have field work in Antarctica."

This time of residence is in conflict with the prevailing idea that canyon associated hotspots are primarily maintained by phytoplankton that are locally grown in association with these features by the upwelling of deep waters rich with nutrients that fuel the phytoplankton growth. Instead, the implication is that horizontal ocean circulation is likely more important to maintaining these biological hotspots than local upwelling through its physical concentrating effects. This project seeks to better resolve the factors that create and maintain focused areas of biological activity at canyons along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and create local foraging areas for marine mammals and birds. The project focus is in the analysis of the ocean transport and concentration mechanisms that sustain these biological hotspots, connecting oceanography to phytoplankton and krill, up through the food web to one of the resident predators, penguins. In addition, the research will engage with teachers from school districts serving underrepresented and underserved students by integrating the instructors and their students completely with the science team. Students will conduct their own research with the same data over the same time as researchers on the project. Revealing the fundamental mechanisms that sustain these known hotspots will significantly advance our understanding of the observed connection between submarine canyons and persistent penguin population hotspots over ecological time, and provide a new model for how Antarctic hotspots function.<br/> <br/> <br/>To understand the physical mechanisms that support persistent hotspots along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), this project will integrate a modeling and field program that will target the processes responsible for transporting and concentrating phytoplankton and krill biomass to known penguin foraging locations. Within the Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot, the team will deploy a High Frequency Radar (HFR) coastal surface current mapping network, uniquely equipped to identify the eddies and frontal regions that concentrate phytoplankton and krill. The field program, centered on surface features identified by the HFR, will include (i) a coordinated fleet of gliders to survey hydrography, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and active acoustics at the scale of the targeted convergent features; (ii) precise penguin tracking with GPS-linked satellite telemetry and time-depth recorders (TDRs); (iii) and weekly small boat surveys that adaptively target and track convergent features to measure phytoplankton, krill, and hydrography. A high resolution physical model will generalize our field measurements to other known hotspots along the WAP through simulation and determine which physical mechanisms lead to the maintenance of these hotspots. The project will also engage educators, students, and members of the general public in Antarctic research and data analysis with an education program that will advance teaching and learning as well as broadening participation of under-represented groups. This engagement includes professional development workshops, live connections to the public and classrooms, student research symposia, and program evaluation.  Together the integrated research and engagement will advance our understanding of the role regional transport pathways and local depth dependent concentrating physical mechanisms play in sustaining these biological hotspots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coincident with this extinction, the Antarctic portion of the supercontinent of Pangea transitioned to a warmer climatic regime and became devoid of glaciers.  Little is known about the survivors of the extinction in Antarctica, although it has been hypothesized that the continent?s more polar location shielded it from the worst of the extinction?s effects.  The Shackleton Glacier region is the best place to study this extinction in Antarctica because it exposes the correct age rocks in abundance and relevant fossils were found there in the 1960s and 1980s.  For this research, paleontologists will study fossil vertebrates that span from about 260?240 million years ago to understand how life evolved at high latitudes in the face of massive climate change.  In addition, geologists will use fossil soils and fossil plant matter to more precisely understand the climate of Antarctica across this extinction boundary.  These data will allow for a more complete understanding of ancient climates and how Antarctic life compared to that at lower latitudes.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be actively involved in this research.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at several natural history museums.<br/><br/>This three-year project will examine the evolution of Permo-Triassic paleoenvironments and their vertebrate communities by conducting fieldwork in the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  The team will characterize the Permo-Triassic boundary within Shackleton area strata and correlate it to other stratigraphic successions in the region (e.g. via stable carbon isotope stratigraphy of fossilized plant organic matter).  The researchers will use multiple types of data to assess the paleoenvironment, including: 1) paleosol morphology; 2) paleosol geochemistry; 3) pedogenic organic matter; and 4) fossil wood chronology and stable isotopes.  The Fremouw Formation of Antarctica preserves the highest paleolatitude (~70 S) tetrapod fauna of the entire Triassic and thus has the potential to shed important light on the evolution of polar life during the early Mesozoic.  The biology of Triassic vertebrates from Antarctica will be compared to conspecifics from lower paleolatitudes through analysis of growth in bone and tusk histology.  An interdisciplinary approach will be used to address relationships between environmental change, faunal composition, and biogeographic patterns in the context of the high-latitude strata preserved in the Buckley and Fremouw formations in the Shackleton Glacier region."

PI Sine Anahita is proposing to use research methods that although standard in other fields for decades, e.g., anthropology, science and technology studies, social psychology, etc, are in less frequent use among sociologists.  The primary method the PI is proposing is a more qualitative approach to visual analysis of archival films, photographs, and audiovisual recordings of interviews with manual tradesmen.  The PI was inspired to propose this project when she examined the Jasper Wyman, collection at the Alaska State Museum.   Wyman was a photographer and gold prospector who documented gold prospecting along a remote Arctic river basin during the winter of 1898-99.  His photographs visually narrated the work and personal life experiences of men engaged in this labor under extreme Arctic environmental conditions.   This led the PI to consider how the social relationships men form through their labor have changed over the last 125 years.   The PI will examine materials held in public archives and private collections ranging from the 19th century Alaska gold mining period through contemporary photos and interviews of tradesmen.  The project is unique in its analysis of visual data and interviews with Alaskan male tradesmen.    <br/><br/>The PIs choice to examine tradesmen's friendships comes not only from her access to an unprecedented archive of 19th century photographs but also from the fact that employment in the trades in Alaska has been dominated by men.  Although less so today, men still make up 63% of the population on the North Slope of Alaska, where jobs are primarily in the oil field trades.  In addition, at a ratio of 109 men to 100 women, Alaska has the highest gender imbalance in the United States, the second highest is Wyoming at 104.  Although these ratios have changed considerably from the 19th century, it supports the PIs choice to focus on men and how their work relationships are not only affected by social and environmental systems but how they have changed over time.   <br/><br/>Because of the rich visual data from 19th century through contemporary Alaskan times, the researcher is proposing to focus on men's social relationships with other men.   The PI states her case, ""The vast majority of men who have worked in Alaska are engaged in manual trades such as heavy equipment operator in the oil and gas fields, construction of the oil pipeline, prospecting and mining gold, and commercial fishing.""   A key question that guides the research is how does the history of Alaska, its demographic makeup, its geography, its remoteness, and its climate affect tradesmen's social relationships?"

Glaciers have moved across the Antarctic landscape over thousands to millions of years, leaving these ground-up sediments in their wake. This study builds on pilot discoveries by the investigators that revealed remarkably large and variable measurements of surface area in glacially-derived fine-grained sediments found in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), one of the few landscapes on the Antarctic continent not currently covered by ice.  Surface area is key to chemical weathering, the process by which rock is converted to soils as ions are carried away in streams and groundwater. These chemical weathering processes are also one of the primary means by which the Earth system naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Hence, high surface areas observed in sediments implies high ""weatherability"" which in turn translates to more potential carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere. Therefore, chemical weathering in high surface area glacial sediments may have significant impacts on Earth's carbon cycle. The researchers will measure the chemical and physical properties of sediments previously collected from the Dry Valleys to understand what factors lead to production of sediment with high-surface area and potential ""weather ability"" and investigate how sediment produced in these glacial systems could ultimately impact Earth's carbon budget. Results from this research will help scientists (including modelers) refine predictions of the effects of melting glaciers- and attendant exposure of glacial sediment? on atmospheric carbon levels. These results may also contribute to applied research efforts on development of carbon-dioxide removal technologies utilizing principles of rock weathering. In addition to the scientific benefits, this research will involve several students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels, including science education undergraduates, thus contributing to training of the next-generation STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Physical weathering produces fresh surfaces, greatly enhancing specific surface area (SSA) and reactive surface area (RSA) of primary minerals. Quantifying SSA and RSA of sediments is key to determining dissolution and leaching rates during natural weathering, but few data exist on distribution of sediment SA, particularly in glacial and fluvial systems. Pilot data from glacial stream systems in Taylor Valley and Wright Valley (located in the MDV) exhibit remarkably high and variable values in both SSA and RSA, values that in some cases greatly exceed values from muds in temperate glacial systems. This discovery motivates the current research, which aims to investigate the hypothesis that high and variable SAs of muds within Wright and Taylor Valleys reflect textural and/or compositional inheritance from the differing depositional settings within the MDV, biologic controls, dust additions, and/or pedogenic processes. These hypotheses will be tested by sedimentologically, mineralogically, and geochemically characterizing muds from glacially derived sediment deposited in various environments (cold vs. wet based glaciation; fluvial, lacustrine, dust, and drift deposits) and of varying age (Miocene to Modern) from the MDV and quantifying variation of SA and reactivity. Comparisons with analyzed muds from temperate glacial systems will enable polar-temperate comparisons. Analyses will focus on muds of previously collected sediment from the MDVs. Grain size and SSA will be measured by Laser Analysis and N2 adsorption BET, respectively. After carbonate removal, samples will be re-analyzed for SSA, and muds characterized geochemically. Mineralogy and bulk chemistry will also be assessed on co-occurring sand fractions, and textural attributes documented. SSA-normalized dissolution experiments will be used to compare solutes released from sediments to determine RSAs. Results will be integrated with the various sedimentologic and geochemical analyses to test the posed hypotheses. Ultimately, this research should shed light on how weathering in Antarctic systems contributes to global carbon cycling."

In hot years, studies have shown that glaciers move relatively slow, as meltwater infiltrating the glacier form large subglacial rivers, that deprive the basal surface of meltwater. However, it is difficult to make long-term predictions of glacier behavior from existing, short datasets, because we know the way a glacier responds to meltwater reaching the bed can change. This research will develop a unique long-term dataset to investigate how the speed and pattern of water-mediated glacier motion changes as a glacier?s shape and plumbing system adjust to a changing climate. The work will allow better prediction of future glacier change and enhance understanding of how glaciers shape landscapes over geologic time. We will train undergraduate and graduate students in field and laboratory research practices, preparing them for careers in science. We will partner with a documentary filmmaker and Jasper National Park (Alberta, Canada), which hosts our field site, to develop educational materials that will show park visitors the importance of glaciers and scientific research to human society. <br/><br/>Understanding centennial scale changes in basal motion is essential for predicting how the world?s glaciers will respond to climate warming, with implications for sea level rise and downstream habitat quality and water resources. The investigators will revisit Athabasca glacier to offer a detailed picture of how the glacier basal motion has evolved as the glacier has thinned and retreated since seminal glaciology research conducted there in the 1960s. We will collect borehole inclinometry and water pressure, glacier surface velocity, radar-based ice thickness, and hydrometeorological data, among other field-based and remotely sensed observations. We will use a numerical glacier flow model to interpret these data.

Satellite observations extending over the last 25 years show that Thwaites Glacier is rapidly thinning and accelerating. Over this same period, the Thwaites grounding line, the point at which the glacier transitions from sitting on the seabed to floating, has retreated. Oceanographic studies demonstrate that the main driver of these changes is incursion of warm water from the deep ocean that flows beneath the floating ice shelf and causes basal melting. The period of satellite observation is not long enough to determine how a large glacier, such as Thwaites, responds to long-term and near-term changes in the ocean or the atmosphere. As a result, records of glacier change from the pre-satellite era are required to build a holistic understanding of glacier behavior. Ocean-floor sediments deposited at the retreating grounding line and further offshore contain these longer-term records of changes in the glacier and the adjacent ocean. An additional large unknown is the topography of the seafloor and how it influences interactions of landward-flowing warm water with Thwaites Glacier and affects its stability. Consequently, this project focuses on the seafloor offshore from Thwaites Glacier and the records of past glacial and ocean change contained in the sediments deposited by the glacier and surrounding ocean.<br/><br/>Uncertainty in model projections of the future of Thwaites Glacier will be significantly reduced by cross-disciplinary investigations seaward of the current grounding line, including extracting the record of decadal to millennial variations in warm water incursion, determining the pre-satellite era history of grounding-line migration, and constraining the bathymetric pathways that control flow of warm water to the grounding line. Sedimentary records and glacial landforms preserved on the seafloor will allow reconstruction of changes in drivers and the glacial response to them over a range of timescales, thus providing reference data that can be used to initiate and evaluate the reliability of models. Such data will further provide insights on the influence of poorly understood processes on marine ice sheet dynamics. This project will include an integrated suite of marine and sub-ice shelf research activities aimed at establishing boundary conditions seaward of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line, obtaining records of the external drivers of change, improving knowledge of processes leading to collapse of Thwaites Glacier, and determining the history of past change in grounding line migration and conditions at the glacier base. These objectives will be achieved through high-resolution geophysical surveys of the seafloor and analysis of sediments collected in cores from the inner shelf seaward of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line using ship-based equipment, and from beneath the ice shelf using a corer deployed through the ice shelf via hot water drill holes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The model will be used to systematically investigate the dynamics of Antarctic glaciers, and to test their response to a variety of perturbations.  The intellectual merit of the project relates to the fact that outlet glacier speeds exert a major control on ice sheet mass balance and contribution to sea level rise; it is essential that their sensitivity to a range of dynamic processes is properly understood and incorporated into prognostic ice sheet models. <br/><br/>The objectives include estimating the sensitivity of individual glaciers to both climate and non-climate forcings, calculating changes in mass flux based on a number of different perturbations, and characterizing how glacier response varies across the ice sheet.  The broader impacts of the project include education and outreach as well as contributions to the field of ice sheet modeling.  The numerical model used in this project will be incorporated into an online interactive website, called the DYNamic Antarctic MODel (DYNAMOD) that will allow students and researchers to investigate Antarctic glacier dynamics, hypothesize about response behaviors, and test their results. Detailed model results will be widely distributed to the community through publications, while the model framework will be available online for student and researcher exploration.  The proposed work will provide significant research opportunities for several early-career scientists, including the PI, a Post-Doctoral Researcher, and a glaciology PhD student. The scope of the project provides unique training in glaciology, modeling, computer programming and science education for the PI and her entire research team.  The award is a CAREER award and as such the research and education will be integrated through the development and distribution of a numerical glacier flow model and online glacier database. Studies show that data-driven explorations, and the use of dynamic visualizations, increase student understanding of both complex processes and fundamental (math and physics) skills. This project aims to use a numerical flowline model to improve understanding of Antarctic glacier dynamics while also familiarizing students with applied math, science and modeling techniques."

This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).<br/>  <br/>The eastern Siberian ecosystem is established on the largest and deepest permafrost region in the world, where much of the earth?s carbon dioxide is sequestrated. This unique permafrost-based ecosystem is currently threatened by global warming. In addition to the direct effects of this warming, permafrost degradation may cause further change in vegetation and carbon budget and greenhouse gas emission that may then feedback to the climate system.  In this vulnerable region, considerable economic and demographic change is taking place as populations within the cities of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) expand and increase their carbon emissions, while smaller settlements decline and struggle to afford heating fuel due to rising costs associated with the urban demands for energy.  The environmental impacts of population and emission growth in this environmentally vulnerable region and the need for viable low carbon energy solutions for Arctic residents drive the COPERA project.  The collaborative research team from the US, Russia, and Japan will establish a permafrost, hydrological, and meteorological observing network in cooperation with local communities to estimate CO2 sequestration by the permafrost ecosystem (tundra and taiga) and CO2 emission form cities and villages. In this study, the carbon budget (CO2 sequestration by ecosystem and CO2 emission through human activity) is estimated as a measure of two different points of view. One is a measure of impact on climate and environment, and the other is that of living cost because more fuel combustion means higher cost for energy. Both of these measures have impacts well beyond the local effects in the Sakha region. Data gathered during this project will be translated into publicly accessible materials and shared with local residents and government to inform municipal, regional, or Republic governmental committees and/or council meetings."

The McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project has been observing these ecosystems since 1993 and this award will support key long-term measurements, manipulation experiments, synthesis, and modeling to test current theories on ecosystem structure and function.  Data collection is focused on meteorology and physical and biological dimensions of soils, streams, lakes, glaciers, and permafrost. The long-term measurements show that biological communities have adapted to the seasonally cold, dark, and arid conditions that prevail for all but a short period in the austral summer. Physical (climate and geological) drivers impart a dynamic connectivity among portions of the Dry Valley landscape over seasonal to millennial time scales. For instance, lakes and soils have been connected through cycles of lake-level rise and fall over the past 20,000 years while streams connect glaciers to lakes over seasonal time scales. Overlaid upon this physical system are biotic communities that are structured by the environment and by the movement of individual organisms within and between the glaciers, streams, lakes, and soils.  The new work to be conducted at the McMurdo LTER site will explore how the layers of connectivity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys influence ecosystem structure and function. <br/>  <br/>This project will test the hypothesis that increased ecological connectivity following enhanced melt conditions within the McMurdo Dry Valleys ecosystem will amplify exchange of biota, energy, and matter, homogenizing ecosystem structure and functioning. This hypothesis will be tested with new and continuing experiments that examine: 1) how climate variation alters connectivity among landscape units, and 2) how biota are connected across a heterogeneous landscape using state-of-the-science tools and methods including automated sensor networks, analysis of seasonal satellite imagery, biogeochemical analyses, and next-generation sequencing. McMurdo LTER education programs and outreach activities will be continued, and expanded with new programs associated with the 200th anniversary of the first recorded sightings of Antarctica. These activities will advance societal understanding of how polar ecosystems respond to change. McMurdo LTER will continue its mission of training and mentoring students, postdocs, and early career scientists as the next generation of leaders in polar ecosystem science, and lead the development of international environmental stewardship protocols for human activities in the region.<br/>"

The intellectual merit of the work is that ocean gravity waves are dynamic elements of the global ocean environment, affected by ocean warming and changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns. Their evolution may thus drive changes in ice-shelf stability by both mechanical interactions, and potentially increased basal melting, which in turn feed back on sea level rise. Gravity wave-induced signal propagation across ice shelves depends on ice shelf and sub-shelf water cavity geometry (e.g. structure, thickness, crevasse density and orientation), as well as ice shelf physical properties. Emphasis will be placed on observation and modeling of the RIS response to IG wave forcing at periods from 75 to 300 s. Because IG waves are not appreciably damped by sea ice, seasonal monitoring will give insights into the year-round RIS response to this oceanographic forcing. The 3-year project will involve a 24-month period of continuous data collection spanning two annual cycles on the RIS. RIS ice-front array coverage overlaps with a synergistic Ross Sea Mantle Structure (RSMS) study, giving an expanded array beneficial for IG wave localization. The ice-shelf deployment will consist of sixteen stations equipped with broadband seismometers and barometers. Three seismic stations near the RIS front will provide reference response/forcing functions, and measure the variability of the response across the front. A linear seismic array orthogonal to the front will consist of three stations in-line with three RSMS stations. Passive seismic array monitoring will be used to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of ocean wave-induced signal sources along the front of the RIS and estimate ice shelf structure, with the high-density array used to monitor and localize fracture (icequake) activity. The broader impacts include providing baseline measurements to enable detection of ice-shelf changes over coming decades which will help scientists and policy-makers respond to the socio-environmental challenges of climate change and sea-level rise. A postdoctoral scholar in interdisciplinary Earth science will be involved throughout the course of the research. Students at Cuyamaca Community College, San Diego County, will develop and manage a web site for the project to be used as a teaching tool for earth science and oceanography classes, with development of an associated web site on waves for middle school students."

Massive ice shelves buttress marine terminating glaciers, slowing the rate that land ice reaches the sea and, in turn, restraining the rate of sea level rise. To date, most work has focused on the destabilizing impacts of warmer air and water temperatures, resulting in melting that thins and weakens ice shelves. However, recent findings indicate that sea ice does not protect ice shelves from wave impacts as much as previously thought, which has raised the possibility that tsunamis and other ocean waves could affect shelf stability. This project will assess the potential for increased shelf fracturing from the impact of tsunamis and from heightened wave activity due to climate-driven changes in storm patterns and reduced sea-ice extent by developing models to investigate how wave impacts damage ice shelves. The modeling effort will allow for regional comparisons between large and small ice shelves, and provide an evaluation of the impacts of changing climate and storm patterns on ice shelves, ice sheets, glaciers, and, ultimately, sea level rise. This project will train graduate students in mathematical modeling and interdisciplinary approaches to Earth and ocean sciences.<br/><br/>This project takes a four-pronged approach to estimating the impact of vibrations on ice shelves at the grounding zone due to tsunamis, very long period, infragravity, and storm-driven waves. First, the team will use high-resolution tsunami modeling to investigate the response of ice shelves along the West Antarctic coast to waves originating in different regions of the Pacific Ocean. Second, it will compare the response to wave impacts on grounding zones of narrow and wide ice shelves. Third, it will assess the exposure risk due to storm forcing through a reanalysis of weather and wave model data; and, finally, the team will model the propagation of ocean-wave-induced vibrations in the ice from the shelf front to and across the grounding zone. In combination, this project aims to identify locations along the Antarctic coast that are subject to enhanced, bathymetrically-focused, long-period ocean-wave impacts. Linkages between wave impacts and climate arise from potential changes in sea-ice extent in front of shelves, and changes in the magnitude, frequency, and tracks of storms. Understanding the effects of ocean waves and climate on ice-shelf integrity is critical to anticipate their contribution to the amplitude and timing of sea-level rise. Wave-driven reductions in ice-shelf stability may enhance shelf fragmentation and iceberg calving, reducing ice shelf buttressing and eventually accelerating sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key aspect is to understand how processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice interact and affect Arctic ocean sea ice behavior and distribution.  As part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign, this project is deploying an ultra-wideband microwave radiometer to improve the ability to remotely determine sea ice thickness information. The long term measurements of sea ice available from MOSAiC's one year deployment of the RV Polarstern into an Arctic ice floe, combined with the extensive ice, ocean, and atmosphere in-situ measurements to be acquired, provide an optimal environment for sea ice monitoring studies, which in turn enable better models of sea ice evolution.  Those models are criticall important to advancing Arctic system science and predicting the future of the Arctic. Student training will also provide societal impact by preparing the next generation of researchers in polar science and observation.<br/><br/>The difficult conditions of the Arctic along with its spatially heterogeneous forcing motivate remote Earth observations from satellites or airborne platforms. Remote sensing systems have proven to be effective in monitoring sea ice extent and fractional cover, as well as sea ice thickness and type to a lesser extent. Current L-band (1.4-GHz) microwave radiometers and laser altimeters have limited sensitivity to ice thickness in the range from 0.5 to 2 meters, which is increasingly common as compared to thicker multi-year ice. An ability to sense sea ice temperature and salinity properties, and particularly their variations within the ice itself, could also provide important new benefits for understanding ice formation and dissolution.<br/><br/>The project is deploying a four channel ultra-wideband microwave radiometer observing from 0.5 to 2 GHz as part of the MOSAiC central observatory in order to acquire a unique dataset of ice thermal emissions and their variations with thickness and other ice properties. By measuring thermal emissions from sea ice at multiple frequencies, and frequencies lower than 1.4 GHz, more information on ice properties, and to greater depth, will be possible.  The measurements acquired will further play an important role in bridging between the point in situ measurements to be acquired by other MOSAiC program investigators and the approximately 9 m x 26 m instrument footprint that will provide ice properties averaged over the ""intermediate"" scales associated with ice floes. The three year project includes instrument preparation and planning in year one, campaign participation in year 2 (including staffing by project personnel during MOSAiC legs I and II), and extensive data analysis in year 3.<br/><br/>By advancing understanding of the spatial scaling between sea ice properties at point (in situ) and floe scales, the project will provide an important link to enable ""sub-grid-scale"" phenomena parameterization in sea ice forecast models. The time histories of thickness, salinity, and temperature acquired will also represent important datasets for characterizing the sea ice energy budget over relevant spatial scales. The advancement achieved in the use of passive microwave remote sensing will also provide new insights into the electromagnetic properties of sea ice for use in future development of new instrumentation and satellite observation methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.<br/><br/>Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support for research projects that utilize existing Arctic observing systems, datasets and models to evaluate key sustainability challenges and opportunities in the Arctic region, to innovate new sustainability science theory and approaches to these challenges and opportunities, and support decision-making towards a sustainable Arctic environment.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and end users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  <br/><br/>Global connections and changing resource use systems in the Arctic (CONNECT) unites the expertise from researchers in Norway, Canada, the US, and Russia to investigate how globally connected systems influence local sustainability, socioeconomic, and ecological practices.  In particular, the team investigates the effects of introduced extractive industries, tourism, and communications technologies on community responses, disturbances, and ecosystem changes.  The six work packages utilize data sets and research methods developed by the team under previously funded efforts and include community interviews, socioeconomic and policy analyses, land use and vegetation maps, mining development histories, and local perceptions of land use and ecosystem services.  These inputs will be used in an integrative fashion to develop model and monitoring indicators of ecological impacts and measure the effects of global connections on resource use systems.  The project will continue its collaboration with 28 communities and conduct re-visit workshops during the course of the project to share progress."

Like the oceans, Earth's atmosphere experiences planet-wide gravitational tides caused by the Moon. In addition to planetary atmospheric waves of various scale caused by Earth's rotation, the largest amplitude of upward-propagating,  thermally forced atmospheric tides are generated by the periodic heating of the atmosphere by the Sun ? the atmosphere is heated during the day and not heated at night. All of these phenomena transport heat and momentum from the lower atmosphere into the upper atmosphere. Understanding the coupling of these waves between both the Northern and Southern hemispheres and from the lower atmosphere to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere will lead to the key processes responsible for transporting energy throughout the entire atmosphere-ionosphere system.<br/><br/>This award will let scientists investigate the spatial-temporal structure and variability of the Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere circulation at high latitudes. For this goal, a state-of-the-art meteor radar system will be installed at McMurdo Station, which then will provide hourly mean velocities of the zonal and meridional neutral winds between 80 and 100 km altitude operating continuously 24/7 through the year. Two existing models, the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and the Global-Scale Wave Model (GSWM), will be employed to analyze radar observations in the global context. The collected data will be published almost instantaneously at a project website and provided to the NSF-supported CEDAR/Madrigal database and the Antarctic Master Directory. The project supports and trains one graduate and one undergraduate students; a young professional research assistant will also be involved in this effort. To broaden participation of underrepresented groups, students from the University of Colorado Summer Multicultural Access to Research and Training program will be engaged to locate qualified students to participate on this project."

Blue whales are an important endangered species in Polar waters, but specimens are extremely rare, making them difficult to research, see, and study. Skeletal anatomy is a fundamental dataset for archeology and a host of biosciences, with direct application to evolutionary models, developmental biology, comparative anatomy and physiology, paleontology, and ecology. Digital collections of skeletal data serve many different disciplines that rely on reference collections to identify animal remains, such as anthropology and forensic science. This research will take advantage of a unique opportunity to create a digital record of the complete anatomy of a blue whale, which is currently being processed for mounting at the museum. The 3D model of the blue whale created in this project will be freely available to the public for the first time, allowing for researchers and the public to easily access and interact with the specimen that would have otherwise required a special in-person trip to the museum housing this collection. <br/><br/>In order to complete the 3D model, technicians from the Idaho Museum of Natural History will travel to the Noyo Center to scan the blue whale skeleton over two weeks, followed by processing of 3D at the Idaho Virtualization Lab. The 3D model will be made available on open-access websites, including MorphoSource. Digital model files will be created back at the IVL at the Idaho Museum of Natural History. The IVL provides internships to 10-12 Idaho State University undergraduate and graduate students each year, where they receive hands-on training in 3D model construction, from start to finish. Post-processing for models will be facilitated by these students, with oversight from the project's lead technician.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We will use geospatial integration and interdisciplinary data aggregation to document biophysical and socioeconomic changes occurring in the Arctic and to develop scenarios exploring how these complex patterns of change are likely to play out over the coming decades. This assessment will include all four ArcSEES themes (Natural and Living Environment; Built Environment; Natural Resource Development; and Governance) and provide a point of departure for the use of institutional diagnostics to examine effective strategies for addressing  current issues of Arctic governance.  To lend substance to the analysis, we will direct attention to three ""hot spots"": Bering Strait and the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (United States, Canadian and Russian interests), the Barents Sea (Norwegian and Russian interests), and West Greenland (Greenlandic, Danish, and Canadian interests). In the process, we will engage people associated with bodies like the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, whose remit extends into the Arctic Ocean.  To enhance cost-effectiveness, the project will collaborate with the SEARCH (Study of Environmental Change: www.arcus.org/search) and ACCESS  (Arctic Climate Change, Economy and Society: www.access-eu.org) projects that are supported extensively within the United States and Europe, respectively. The project, which is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and Centre Nationale de al Recherche Scientifique, will add value through partnerships with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (www.nceas.ucsb.edu) in the United States and institutions in France associated with the ACCESS project as well as the Ice Atmosphere Arctic Ocean Observing System project (www.iaoos-equipex.upmc.fr). The holistic process we develop to generate and share options for Arctic coastal-marine sustainability will be memorialized by publications and through a video series emphasizing lessons of ?science diplomacy? to further stimulate education by and for the benefit of all stakeholders - representatives of government agencies, academia, industry, non-governmental organizations, and civil society.

On multi-decadal timescales, this uncertainty is largely due to differences in the strength of feedback processes within the models. For the Arctic system, changes in surface reflection of heat and light (albedo) dominate the feedback process with the most significant departures in the surface heat balance. However, models employ relatively crude representations of many processes that are relevant to surface albedo evolution. To improve model predictions, we need enhanced parameterizations that are informed by the collection and analysis of relevant observations. Better Arctic predictions are particularly critical given the large changes underway and the urgent need to plan for and adapt to changes soon. <br/> <br/>This project will improve the representation of the sea ice cover and the surface reflection of heat and light (albedo feedback) in climate models through the integration of climate model experiments and field measurements. Sensitivity studies with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) will be used to assess the relative importance of albedo-related parameterization uncertainties. These studies will inform the snow, sea ice, and solar radiation observations conducted as part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) field campaign. Measurements will then fuel process understanding and parameterization development within CESM. Experiments with the improved CESM will then be performed to determine the effects of upgraded albedo feedback characterization for Earth system predictions. The focus will be on partitioning and fate of solar energy in a seasonal ice system, the role of snow properties in controlling the sea ice mass balance and radiation budget, and processes affecting ice-ocean energy exchange and ice mass and area changes. These are areas for which process understanding is lacking, model parameterizations are crude, and uncertainties have large effects on model projections. By integrating modeling and observational work, the basic process understanding of controls on Arctic solar energy distribution and sea ice mass budgets will be enhanced. The incorporation of this knowledge in improved model process representation will strengthen prediction capabilities and allow for a deeper understanding of the role of the albedo feedback in projected Arctic change. <br/><br/>Model developments will be incorporated into the widely-used Los Alamos Community Ice Model (CICE) and made freely available through standard releases of CESM and CICE.

The PIs present a nominal plan to reduce ANET by approximately half to a longer-term community ""backbone network"" in the final 2 years of this project. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>Monitoring and understanding mass change and dynamic behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet using in situ GPS and seismological studies will help improve understanding of how Antarctic ice sheets respond to a warming world and how will this response impacts sea-level and other global changes. Seismic and geodetic data collected by the backbone ANET-POLENET network are openly available to the scientific community. ANET-POLENET is integral in the development and realization of technological and logistical innovations for year-round operation of instrumentation at remote polar sites, helping to advance scientifically and geographically broad studies of the polar regions. The ANET-POLENET team will establish a training initiative to mentor young polar scientists in complex, multidisciplinary and internationally collaborative research. ANET-POLENET will continue the broad public outreach to the public about polar science through the polenet.org website, university lectures, and K-12 school visits.

The proposed work will advance our understanding of the degradation of soil carbon exposed to oxygen or sunlight at Earth?s surface during land-surface disturbances. This knowledge will allow scientists to better predict the fate of C in arctic permafrost soils, and through an education and outreach plan, will allow society to better prepare for the potential acceleration of global warming through a positive feedback from the thawing Arctic. To engage underrepresented students in science, the PI proposes to expand the infrastructure of education through partnerships that will offer new opportunities to enhance teaching and communication skills. The PI will develop a curriculum in earth and environmental science integrated with her research, grounded in core education principles, and mapped to assessment goals. A novel contribution to curriculum development will be the combination of (1) education modules that ?telescope? in age-context and difficulty from K-12 to undergraduate to adult outreach levels, (2) data generation on student engagement and learning through micro-assessments of performance, and (3) enhanced active learning by iterative improvement of modules by students for their own peer groups. <br/><br/>This research will be done in the Alaskan Arctic because (1) the lakes, streams, and soil waters provide a natural experimental matrix of both high and low light, oxygen, DOM and Fe concentrations, and (2) there are tremendous stores of organic C in frozen soils (at least twice the amount of C now in the atmosphere) which are rapidly thawing from global warming. Using field surveys and experiments on natural waters to test mechanistic hypotheses, the PI will answer two main research questions: (1) Do reactions mediated by iron favor the complete oxidation of DOM to CO2 by sunlight and microbes? (2) Is the iron-mediated oxidation of DOM in the dark an important determinant of DOM fate?"

Improved knowledge gained through detailed analysis of the processes, and their interactions with the jet stream, will lead to improvements in weather and climate prediction by improving their representation in numerical models.

Although these properties, such as internal temperature, density, grain size, and layer thickness, are highly relevant to studies of Antarctic climate, ice-sheet dynamics, and mass balance, their measurement currently relies on sparse in-situ surveys under challenging weather conditions. Sensors on polar-orbiting satellites can observe the entire Antarctic every few days during their years-long lifetime. Consequently, the approaches developed in this study, when coupled with the advancing technologies of small and low-cost CubeSats, aim to contribute to Antarctic science and lead to cost-effective, convenient, and accurate long-term analyses of the Antarctic system while reducing the human footprint on the continent. Moreover, the project will be solely based on publicly-available datasets; thus, while contributing to interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate research and education at the grantee's institution, the project will also encourage engagement of citizen scientists through its website. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to characterize Antarctic firn layers in terms of their thickness, physical temperature, density, and grain size through multi-frequency microwave radiometer measurements from space. Electromagnetic penetration depth changes with frequency in ice; thus, multi-frequency radiometers are able to profile firn layer properties versus depth. To achieve its objective, the project will utilize the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite constellation as a single multi-frequency microwave radiometer system with 11 frequency channels observing the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Archived in-situ measurements of Antarctic firn density, grain size, temperature, and layer thickness will be collected and separated into training and test datasets. Microwave emissions simulated using the training data will be compared to GPM constellation measurements to evaluate and improve state-of-the-art forward microwave emission models. Based on these models, the project will develop numerical retrieval algorithms for the thermal and physical properties of Antarctic firn. Results of retrievals will be validated using the test dataset, and uncertainty and error analyses will be conducted. Lastly, changes in the thermal and physical characteristics of Antarctic firn will be examined through long-term retrieval studies exploiting GPM constellation measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Changes&#8232;in storm activity, and associated atmospheric feedbacks, have been linked to increased seasonality of the high north in the last decade, and with sea ice depletion during summer months. Cyclones are also likely to respond to changes in Arctic ice cover and ocean state indicating that&#8232;the atmosphere-ocean-ice system is tightly coupled through processes related to cyclones. Previous Arctic modeling studies typically used regional model simulations without full coupling&#8232;of the atmosphere-ocean-ice system, or fully coupled global climate models that do not permit year-on-year comparison with the observational record. This study will avoid such limitations by using&#8232;the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), for which output corresponds directly with month-on-month observational records. This&#8232;will allow assessment of the ice-ocean-atmosphere coupling processes on multiple temporal&#8232;and spatial scales, and to relate them to limited Arctic Ocean measurements to build a more complete understanding of how increased cyclone activity may be helping to shift the surface climate of the Arctic to a new, warmer state with seasonal sea ice cover, and of how cyclones&#8232;will respond to this new Arctic Ocean state. <br/><br/>The impact of cyclones on Arctic stakeholder sectors in northern and western Alaska, including coastal communities and marine transport, will be assessed through a partnership with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy and the project's inventory of Arctic cyclones and associated ocean and sea ice conditions will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Historical time series of annual and seasonal Arctic cyclone activity, maps of tracks and intensities of Arctic cyclones, and case studies of intense or impactful cyclones will be made available on a project web page. The project will engage graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow,&#8232;and results will be used in atmospheric and oceanic science undergraduate and graduate level courses at the project institutions. Outcomes from this work will be address priorities in the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region and will address key uncertainties in understanding extreme events and their role in the Arctic climate system. <br/><br/>The recent loss of Arctic sea ice has increased the potential for ocean-atmosphere coupling&#8232;in the Arctic, especially in areas of low ice concentration or where the ice edge has receded. An important aspect of increased ocean-atmosphere Arctic coupling is the&#8232; potential increase&#8232;of the ocean's response to storms. Where once mitigated by thick ice, wind-induced ice deformation and oceanic mixing are increasing as the ice pack thins. The decreasing Arctic ice cover and associated warming of the Arctic Ocean may also impact cyclone intensity and frequency. This grant will support investigation of changes in atmosphere-ice-ocean coupling in the presence of cyclones in the Arctic. It will advance our understanding of coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice processes with a focus on the role and response of cyclones in altering the state of the Arctic system. A cyclone tracking scheme will be applied to reanalyses, yielding an inventory of Arctic cyclone locations, tracks, and intensities that will provide a framework for analysis of ice and upper-ocean responses to storms. The responses of ice concentration, ocean temperature and salinity, and associated ice mass balance before, during, and after cyclones at a variety of intensities will be documented. The same analysis will be applied&#8232;to output from the high-resolution Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and to output from&#8232;a suite of global climate models (GCMs). Using a novel set of metrics computed from the output of RASM, peak temporal and spatial scales of oceanic mixing, sea ice deformation, and turbulent fluxes associated with the passage of storms in the Arctic will be determined, in order to assess coupled cyclone-ocean-sea ice processes. Changes in the cyclone climatology between pairs of coupled RASM simulations, that differ only in sea ice and ocean state, and in current and end of the 21st century CMIP5 simulations will allow for assessment of cyclone response to changing ocean and ice state.

Global costs of rapid sea-level rise to infrastructure (e.g., houses, roads, farms, ports) are likely to be large.  A possible source of water for sea-level rise is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and Thwaites Glacier in particular.  Ice sheets and glaciers contain vast quantities of water (in the form of ice) that is continually shed to the ocean, and continually replenished by snowfall (from water that evaporates from the oceans).  If the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier loses to the ocean over the next decades is much greater than the amount it receives as snowfall, then sea level in all the world's oceans would rise, possibly as much as a meter (approximately 3 feet).  In order to estimate how likely such a catastrophic scenario would be, we need to better understand the surface over which Thwaites Glacier slides.  If we can better characterize that layer (""is to smooth? Is it rough? Is it soft? Is it hard?""), then computer models of Thwaites would be much improved and we can make better projections of the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier would shed to the ocean.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to learn whether basal conditions allow for rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line or whether retreat may re-stabilize near its current grounding line. These objectives will be achieved by using dedicated ice-flow modeling to guide targeted field surveys and experiments over two seasons, and to measure the most important unknown quantities and incorporate them into the models. Numerical models will be used to generate hypotheses for basal conditions that are testable through geophysical surveys and to project future behavior of Thwaites Glacier after assimilating the resulting data. The geophysical methods include seismic, radar, gravity, and electrical surveys that together will allow for a fuller characterization of the bed.  We will conduct field surveys in areas representative of different parts of the glacier, including across the margins, near the grounding line, and along the central axis of the glacier into its catchment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis ""Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments"". The project will be undertaken by a collaborative team of scientists, with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, geophysics, glaciology, marine geology, paleoceanography, and science communication."

In order to improve predictions that enable us to anticipate and plan for future change in ice cover on seasonal to decadal time scales, we need to understand the processes driving the observed change. An area of particular interest is the temperature-driven mass balance of the ice cover. The mass balance is the balance between the amount of ice growth in the winter and the amount of melt in the summer. Mass balance is a key climate change indicator since it combines the impact of heating and cooling at the top and bottom of the ice. If there is net warming over time, then there will be thinning of the ice. Conversely, net cooling leads to thicker ice. The objective of our project is to contribute to the Arctic Observing Network by maintaining a network of autonomous ice mass balance (IMB) buoys, installed in the drift ice of the Arctic Ocean. The observations from these buoys enable us to explore what changes in sea ice thickness are taking place and how these changes occur, thereby improving our understanding of this complex and important component of the global environment. Broader Impacts include contributing to Dartmouth College?s Women in Science Program and an ?adopt a buoy? program for middle school students. <br/><br/>The primary objectives of our project are to: 1) procure and deploy a minimum of 5 IMB buoys per year, to  increase network coverage, and 2) process and archive the data from these buoys to ensure that they are fully, freely, openly, and immediately accessible to all researchers and interested users. A key to achieving the first objective is an advancement in buoy technology, creating a version of the IMB that costs less to produce, is easier to deploy, and is designed for deployment in the increasingly prevalent seasonal sea ice cover. We will continue to strategically deploy the IMBs in coordination with complementary atmospheric and oceanographic instruments to optimize the observations throughout the Arctic Ocean. We will also continue to build on our strong national and international collaborations, to maximize the extent of the IMB network across the Arctic Basin and to minimize the logistic costs associated with deployment. The end result will be an integrated atmosphere-ice-ocean observing array providing a comprehensive description of the response of the ice cover to atmospheric and oceanic forcing."

Associated with the Arctic warming and waning sea-ice cover is a reorganization of the surface and deep-water circulation of the Arctic Ocean, but understanding of the associated processes is limited. The early to mid-Holocene provides a post-glacial analogue of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, similar to scenarios that have been proposed for the next several decades. This early-mid Holocene sea ice minimum, 10?6 thousand years ago, is often attributed to changes in solar forcing. However, records providing information on upper Arctic water column stratification during episodes of minimum sea ice cover are sparse. The normal paleoceanographic proxies for water mass stratification cannot be applied in the Arctic; different approaches are required to reconstruct water column hydrography. The proposed research has the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of past Arctic water column hydrography from the early to mid-Holocene sea ice minimum and inform scenario development of future conditions in the Arctic Ocean. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to workforce development through support for the training of a PhD student.  The technology developed will be proactively transferred to the international science community through a formal workshop.  <br/><br/>Recent innovations in the combined use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (laser-ablation ICP-MS) and Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) have shown that a wealth of environmental information about water column stratification can be extracted from single shells of fossil foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) (Nps), grows its chambers (ontogenetic calcite) near the Arctic surface, and subsequently sinks through the water column where it adds a thick calcite crust around the thinly calcified chambers at sub-mixed layer depths. Thus, each individual Nps shell contains chemical and isotopic zonation from waters with distinctly different physical properties ? the generally cold low salinity surface mixed layer and warmer subsurface halocline. Intrashell variability can be measured with in situ analytical approaches. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to apply a multi-instrument approach to quantify intrashell geochemistry in Nps shells obtained from an array of boxcore samples across the Arctic Ocean. They plan to combine intrashell 18O and 13C measurements in <5 m-sized domains by SIMS with analyses of Mg/Ca (proxy for temperature), Ba/Ca (proxy for river runoff or meltwater discharge), and Na/Ca (proxy for salinity) by laser-ablation ICP-MS on the same Nps shells. The innovative SIMS ultra-small domain isotope analytical approach was developed within the last few years by PI Kozdon, and calibrated in the lab of PI Spero. Both SIMS (spot-measurements) and laser-ablation data (depth profiles through the calcite layers) can be correlated to well defined domains in the foraminiferal shells that reflect a specific stage in the specimens? ontogenetic development (?time-markers?). Each of the measurements can be assigned to a general water depth range that is related to the depth of calcite addition as Nps migrates through the water column during its ontogenetic development. Thus, the proposed analytical approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct past water column stratification between the surface and halocline from individual shells of Nps in sedimentary assemblages. This innovative multi-instrument approach will be applied to mid-Holocene and late Holocene Nps shells from ~50 14C-dated box-coretop samples from the Arctic Ocean. The cores will be carefully selected, mainly from U.S. core repositories, using the following criteria: (I) good coverage of the Arctic Ocean with a focus on key-areas sensitive to changes in water mass stratification and (II) existing 14C dates, although some of the cores will still need to be dated."

Previous field expeditions to the Allan Hills blue ice area, Antarctica, have recovered ice cores that date to one million years, the oldest ice cores yet recovered from Antarctica.  These records have revealed that interglacial CO2 concentrations decreased by 800,000 years ago and that, in the warmer world 1 million years ago, CO2 and Antarctic temperature were linked as during the last 800,000 years.  This project will return to the Allan Hills blue ice area to recover additional ice cores that date to 1 million years or older.  The climate records developed from the drilled ice cores will provide new insights into the chemical composition of the atmosphere and Antarctic climate during times of comparable or even greater warmth than the present day.  Our results will help answer questions about issues associated with anthropogenic change. These include the relationship between temperature change and the mass balance of Antarctic ice; precipitation and aridity variations associated with radiatively forced climate change; and the climate significance of sea ice extent.  The project will entrain two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar, and will conduct outreach including workshops to engage teachers in carbon science and ice cores.<br/><br/>Between about 2.8-0.9 million years ago, Earth's climate was characterized by 40,000-year cycles, driven or paced by changes in the tilt of Earth's spin axis. Much is known about the ""40,000-year"" world from studies of deep-sea sediments, but our understanding of climate change during this period is incomplete because we lack records of Antarctic climate and direct records of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.  We propose to address these issues by building on our recent studies of ancient ice from the Main Ice Field, Allan Hills, Antarctica. During previous field seasons we recovered ice extending, discontinuously, from 0.1-1.0 million years old. Ice was dated by measuring the 40Ar/38Ar (Argon) ratio of the trapped gases. Our discovery of million year-old ice demonstrates that there is gas-record-quality ice from the 40,000-year world in the Allan Hills Main Ice Field. We have identified two different sites, each overlying bedrock at ~ 200 m depth, that are attractive targets for coring ice dating to 1 million years and older. This project aims to core the ice at these two sites, re-occupy a previous site with million year-old ice and drill it down to the bedrock, and generate 10-20 short (~10-meter) cores in areas where our previous work and terrestrial meteorite ages suggest ancient surface ice.  We plan to date the ice using the 40Ar/38Ar ages of trapped Argon.  We also plan to characterize the continuity of our cores by measuring the deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios in the ice, methane, ratios of Oxygen and Argon to Nitrogen in trapped gas, the Nitrogen-15 isotope (d15N) of Nitrogen, and the Oxygen-18 isotope (d18O) of Oxygen.  As the ice may be stratigraphically disturbed, these measurements will provide diagnostic properties for assessing the continuity of the ice-core records.  Successful retrieval of ice older than one million years will provide the opportunity for follow-up work to measure the CO2 concentration and other properties within the ice to inform on the temperature history of the Allan Hills region, dust sources and source-area aridity, moisture sources, densification conditions, global average ocean temperature, and greenhouse gas concentrations.  We will analyze the data in the context of leading hypotheses of the 40,000-year world and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition to the 100,000-year world. We expect to advance understanding of climate dynamics during these periods."

Representing the role of icebergs in global climate models (GCMs) poses a formidable challenge to the scientific community. The most striking shortcoming of current iceberg models is arguably that they do not represent giant tabular icebergs, even though giant icebergs carry most of the freshwater stored in icebergs in the Southern Ocean. This lack of large icebergs in models is mostly due to the difficulties associated with adequately modeling iceberg decay. In particular, fracturing and breakup are not typically considered in iceberg models, despite being dominant iceberg decay processes. <br/><br/>Investigators are to address these issues using a hierarchy of iceberg models, ranging from an idealized analytical model to a comprehensive GCM, in concert with recent observational data. The main objective of this study is to develop a new iceberg model that:<br/>(i) accounts for iceberg breakup and fracturing processes that have been neglected to date,<br/>(ii) improves on the representation of iceberg decay processes that were considered in previous models,<br/>(iii) explicitly represents large tabular icebergs.<br/><br/>The primary broader impact of the proposed work will be through a K-12 teacher workshop series showcasing this project as an example of how scientists develop physical models. Ongoing changes in the California K-12 science standards will enable the teachers to creatively use this material in their classrooms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are intimately tied to the people, history, and ecology of the region. This project will bring together archaeologists, computer scientists, geographers, ecologists and Alaska Native rights holders to investigate caribou migrations prior to the dramatic reduction in caribou numbers during the 18th Century. A unique aspect of this project is the creation of a virtual world model of the past environment for a portion of ancient Alaska.  The researchers will then ask experienced Alaska Native hunters to enter the virtual world to seek migrating caribou under different conditions.  Using virtual reality googles and similar equipment, the hunters will be able to experience the model world as if they were actually there.  By following their movements and listening to their descriptions the researchers will be able tell how well the model is simulating reality.  By comparing the model with the hunting locations chosen by ancient hunters known from archaeology, the research team hopes to see how conditions of the environment and of caribou numbers have changed over time. In addition to informing us about the past, the model will provide a valuable new tool for ecologists to think about caribou migrations and how they might be altered in response to future oil and gas development within the region. Beyond the scientific value of the research, the inclusion of Alaska Native communities in the design process will provide an opportunity for  them to inform the model. The gaming format developed from the model will provide a valuable (and easily accessible) educational tool for K-12 students in Alaska, encourage interest in science and technology (STEM) among Alaska Native students, and provide opportunities for the involvement citizen scientists more broadly.<br/><br/>In consultation with Alaska Native communities and local experts the research team will adapt a virtual world model of caribou migration developed for the Early Holocene period in the Great Lakes region and apply it to a portion of modern Alaska.  The present proposal has two main goals.  To allow the research team to become acquainted with the Arctic context of the research and to establish the necessary collaborative contacts particularly among Alaska Native scholars, to ground the virtual world simulation in Alaska.  Second, to recruit one or more Alaska Native hunters to experience the current virtual world simulation via an immersive augmented reality system.  The placing of knowledgeable hunters within a virtual world simulation as a means of exploring the interactions of human actors in modeled environments is an emerging approach to behavioral research in many fields, and this will be among the first systematic applications of the approach to anthropology. Through these activities, the research team will verify the basic elements of the virtual world simulation and fine tune the augmented reality system for recording the movements and comments of the hunters as they traverse the model landscape.  These results will also provide important data for better understanding the Early Holocene occupation of the Great Lakes region and will highlight differences in hunting strategies and tactics observed in recent and ancient times.  The work will also lay the foundation for a systematic remote sensing survey of built hunting structures (both recent and ancient) in an archaeologically under-research portion of Alaska."

This research seeks to understand the connections between the adoption of Christian practices and the development of political power in Iceland between AD 870 and 1300. In about AD 870 the predominately pagan Norse started colonizing the previously uninhabited volcanic island. In AD 1000 Christianity began to replace the widespread pagan beliefs. By 1300, Iceland was dominated by centralized religious and political institutions. Iceland has one of the richest collections of medieval texts and excellent archaeological preservation of Viking Age farmsteads, churches, and cemeteries. This makes research here central to understanding early European history and has the potential to give us insights into the global effects of Christianization in its contemporary context.   <br/> <br/>The project employs geophysical surveying techniques already tested under a previous NSF award, PLR-1242829, ""EAGER: Assessing the Reliability of the Geophysical identification of Early Christian Churchyards and Burials in Northern Iceland.""  The further improvements this project makes in developing geophysical survey protocols, including ground penetrating radar and electromagnetic conductivity, provide for a more cost-effective alternative to traditional excavation and thus, the project has broader applications to archaeological science, forensics, historic preservation, and cultural resource management.<br/><br/>Emerging evidence indicates that the Christianization of Iceland took place in two major phases: a popular adoption in the absence of central religious authority, followed by an institutionalization of church communities and hierarchies. Soon after the Christian conversion many individual farmers established household churches and accompanying cemeteries on their own farmsteads. In the 12th century, many of the household churches and cemeteries appear to have been shut down and replaced with new communal or parish churches. The researchers wish to understand if the parish churches were located on prominent farms that were established early in the colonization sequence or whether these church farms became important political and economic centers only after the Christian conversion.<br/> <br/>The project will investigate the relationship between the settlement history and Christian practices at 13 farms in the Hegranes region of lowland Skagafjordur, just south of the Arctic Circle. Buried farmsteads and Christian cemeteries will be systematically surveyed using archaeological and geophysical survey protocols. Data will be collected on farmstead location, order of establishment, and changes in their size or organization throughout the 400-year period of study. The project will also systematically investigate evidence of Christian practices on these farms, including the presence and location of cemeteries or churches, dates of burials, and abandonment of the cemeteries and churches, including the use of churches after burials ceased. By comparing the farmstead establishment date and size to the geography of the Christian cemeteries, the team will determine the relationship between hierarchies that developed during the early colonization and hierarchies that developed later during the institutionalization of Christianity."

For example, visibility is a product of cloud cover, wind, snow conditions, terrain, and more. The research team will seek to quantify factors and test them through camps for Elders and youth.

In the research team's work with the community of Clyde River, Nunavut, they have found that synthetic environmental variables (e.g., visibility, blowing snow, wave height) are more important than individual meteorological variables (e.g., air temperature, wind speed). In addition, the work will be expanded and strengthened by working with additional communities in the US and Greenland. In short, Inuit synthesize complex variables representing the natural environment to inform decisions that facilitate their life-way in this environment. The research will be carried out in a setting familiar to Inuit and consistent with Inuit social values and interactions, organized as a series of Elder-youth science camps between Alaska Native and Eastern Arctic Inuit. This approach overlaps with strong community interests in fostering interactions and knowledge transfer among Elders and youth, as well as collaborating with visiting scientists. As Elders consider what to do, they will also be teaching the youth, making explicit many thoughts and considerations that otherwise typically remain implicit. The youth, in turn, will help document this knowledge transfer by keeping journals during the camps about their activities and what they are learning and doing. Participant observation by the research team will give insight into this process, so they can understand how awareness of weather and related factors emerge, and will allow them to create mathematical descriptions of those factors.

Trajectories of natural environment change are commonly analyzed, but less studied is how environment change opens alternative social and economic paths, which paths are most desirable, and what actions are needed to sustain them. How do Arctic communities remain viable and what are the implications for human capital development?  Is the Arctic mixed economy, consisting of wage and subsistence activities, sustainable or is the Arctic transitioning to a predominantly industrial, wage economy?  This project will help communities, workers, and businesses address these issues through analysis of current and prospective patterns of human capital development and careers in the major Arctic industries. As part of the the International Polar Research research initiative, this project will develop ?linked,? tripartite case studies of industry, workers, and communities and use videography as both research tool and as a means for community members to document and analyze ongoing changes. <br/><br/>Central to the study are the following issues:  How do communities sustain their coherence and even existence in the face of climate change, of industrial economic development, and of employment and education opportunities that appear to draw off their younger members?  How do individual workers develop skills and careers in highly seasonal work and/or while maintaining subsistence activity and traditional community participation?  How do businesses sustain and grow their activities, develop and fully utilize available human capital, and adapt to changing climate conditions and to economic growth opportunities?  Case studies include: fish processing in St. Paul/Pribilof Islands and oil and gas field services in the North Slope Borough. The Tribal Government of St. Paul will partner in the Aleut/fish processing case study; in the North Slope Borough, Barrow Arctic Science Consortium will partner in the research and several oilfield service companies have agreed to participate.<br/><br/>The important social benefits will be insights into sustainability of careers, businesses, and communities in the face of climate, social, and economic change.  It will provide multiple perspectives on the impact of climate change on human and economic activity.  Partnering with Native communities is an integral part of the methodology to document and assess the role of workforce development in future directions of community development. Video will be used to document and archive contemporary conditions as part of the historical record as well as providing raw ?data? for each community and for future research. The video capability developed in the communities and the technical assistance and participatory research will support ongoing education within and between communities as well as outreach to schools and the public outside the Arctic.<br/>"

This site will yield information on the history of the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams, and on grounding line migration.  The integrated study will include direct sampling of basal ice, water, and sediment from the lake in concert with surface geophysical surveys over a three-year period to define the hydrological connectivity among lakes on the Whillans Ice Plain and their flow paths to the sea. The geophysical surveys will furnish information on subglacial hydrology, aid the site selection for hot-water drilling, and provide spatial context for interpreting findings. The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis ""Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments"".

This project will advance the tools needed to implement adjoint models.<br/><br/>The project will pursue three inter-related work packages to overcome these limitations:<br/>(1) bringing the open-source AD tool OpenAD to full maturity on four open-source Earth system modeling frameworks used in climate research and education<br/>(2) developing  configurations around several science applications where the sensitivity of quantities of interest (cost functions) to inputs (control variables) can be configured for realistic runtimes,<br/>(3) developing a generic Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based framework to enable the coupling between high-resolution forward and low-resolution adjoint models. <br/>The proposed geoscience studies will be of interest to computational and climate scientists.  A broader impact of this research will be to enable adjoint methods to be more easily used across the geosciences, with potential to be transformative for data assimilation and sensitivity analysis in a wide range of geoscience and other disciplines."

Representing the role of icebergs in global climate models (GCMs) poses a formidable challenge to the scientific community. The most striking shortcoming of current iceberg models is arguably that they do not represent giant tabular icebergs, even though giant icebergs carry most of the freshwater stored in icebergs in the Southern Ocean. This lack of large icebergs in models is mostly due to the difficulties associated with adequately modeling iceberg decay. In particular, fracturing and breakup are not typically considered in iceberg models, despite being dominant iceberg decay processes. <br/><br/>Investigators are to address these issues using a hierarchy of iceberg models, ranging from an idealized analytical model to a comprehensive GCM, in concert with recent observational data. The main objective of this study is to develop a new iceberg model that:<br/>(i) accounts for iceberg breakup and fracturing processes that have been neglected to date,<br/>(ii) improves on the representation of iceberg decay processes that were considered in previous models,<br/>(iii) explicitly represents large tabular icebergs.<br/><br/>The primary broader impact of the proposed work will be through a K-12 teacher workshop series showcasing this project as an example of how scientists develop physical models.

Previous field expeditions to the Allan Hills blue ice area, Antarctica, have recovered ice cores that date to one million years, the oldest ice cores yet recovered from Antarctica.  These records have revealed that interglacial CO2 concentrations decreased by 800,000 years ago and that, in the warmer world 1 million years ago, CO2 and Antarctic temperature were linked as during the last 800,000 years.  This project will return to the Allan Hills blue ice area to recover additional ice cores that date to 1 million years or older.  The climate records developed from the drilled ice cores will provide new insights into the chemical composition of the atmosphere and Antarctic climate during times of comparable or even greater warmth than the present day.  Our results will help answer questions about issues associated with anthropogenic change. These include the relationship between temperature change and the mass balance of Antarctic ice; precipitation and aridity variations associated with radiatively forced climate change; and the climate significance of sea ice extent.  The project will entrain two graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar, and will conduct outreach including workshops to engage teachers in carbon science and ice cores.<br/><br/>Between about 2.8-0.9 million years ago, Earth's climate was characterized by 40,000-year cycles, driven or paced by changes in the tilt of Earth's spin axis. Much is known about the ""40,000-year"" world from studies of deep-sea sediments, but our understanding of climate change during this period is incomplete because we lack records of Antarctic climate and direct records of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.  We propose to address these issues by building on our recent studies of ancient ice from the Main Ice Field, Allan Hills, Antarctica. During previous field seasons we recovered ice extending, discontinuously, from 0.1-1.0 million years old. Ice was dated by measuring the 40Ar/38Ar (Argon) ratio of the trapped gases. Our discovery of million year-old ice demonstrates that there is gas-record-quality ice from the 40,000-year world in the Allan Hills Main Ice Field. We have identified two different sites, each overlying bedrock at ~ 200 m depth, that are attractive targets for coring ice dating to 1 million years and older. This project aims to core the ice at these two sites, re-occupy a previous site with million year-old ice and drill it down to the bedrock, and generate 10-20 short (~10-meter) cores in areas where our previous work and terrestrial meteorite ages suggest ancient surface ice.  We plan to date the ice using the 40Ar/38Ar ages of trapped Argon.  We also plan to characterize the continuity of our cores by measuring the deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios in the ice, methane, ratios of Oxygen and Argon to Nitrogen in trapped gas, the Nitrogen-15 isotope (d15N) of Nitrogen, and the Oxygen-18 isotope (d18O) of Oxygen.  As the ice may be stratigraphically disturbed, these measurements will provide diagnostic properties for assessing the continuity of the ice-core records.  Successful retrieval of ice older than one million years will provide the opportunity for follow-up work to measure the CO2 concentration and other properties within the ice to inform on the temperature history of the Allan Hills region, dust sources and source-area aridity, moisture sources, densification conditions, global average ocean temperature, and greenhouse gas concentrations.  We will analyze the data in the context of leading hypotheses of the 40,000-year world and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition to the 100,000-year world. We expect to advance understanding of climate dynamics during these periods."

Thus, snow thickness, distribution, and density, can moderate the recovery of the sea ice pack or exacerbate its loss. Airborne and satellite remote sensing are used to monitor snow depth over sea ice. Interpretation of the remotely sensed microwave signals requires accurate models of how the microwaves interact with the snow.

Results will be applied to the analysis of active and passive microwave remote sensing data of snow over sea ice. Three-dimensional computer simulations of microstructures of snow that resemble that of real snow will be performed on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to compute scattering and emission of snow covering sea-ice. The use of large scale high performance computations will permit the simulations to be run over relatively large spatial domains."

Understanding the environmental factors that control predator population dynamics is critically important for projecting the state of populations under future climate change scenarios, and for designing better conservation strategies for the Antarctic ecosystem. For the first time, datasets from a network of observational sites for the Adlie penguin across the entire Antarctic will be combined and analyzed, with a focus on linkages among the ice environment, primary production, and the population responses of Adlie penguins. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. The results of this project can be used to illustrate intuitively to the general public the complex interactions between ice, ocean, pelagic food web and top predators. This project also offers an excellent platform to demonstrate the process of climate-change science - how scientists simulate climate change scenarios and interpret model results. This project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of polar oceanography, plankton and seabird ecology, coupled physical-biological modeling and mathematical ecology. The results will be broadly disseminated to the general oceanographic research community through scientific workshops, conferences and peer-reviewed journal articles, and to undergraduate and graduate education communities, K-12 schools and organizations, and the interested public through web-based servers using existing infrastructure at the investigators' institutions. <br/><br/>The key question to be addressed in this project is how climate impacts the timing of periodic biological events (phenology) and how interannual variation in this periodic forcing influences the abundance of penguins in the Antarctic. The focus will be on the timing of ice algae and phytoplankton blooms because the high seasonality of sea ice and associated pulsed primary productivity are major drivers of the Antarctic food web. This study will also examine the responses of Adlie penguins to changes in sea ice dynamics and ice algae-phytoplankton phenology. Adlie penguins, like many other Antarctic seabirds, are long-lived, upper trophic-level predators that integrate the effects of sea ice on the food web at regional scales, and thus serve as a reliable biological indicator of environmental changes. The proposed approach is designed to accommodate the limits of measuring and modeling the intermediate trophic levels between phytoplankton and penguins (e.g., zooplankton and fish) at the pan-Antarctic scale, which are important but latent variables in the Southern Ocean food web.  Through the use of remotely sensed and in situ data, along with state of the art statistical approaches (e.g. wavelet analysis) and numerical modeling, this highly interdisciplinary study will advance our understanding of polar ecosystems and improve the projection of future climate change scenarios."

Although this process is a key aspect of plate tectonics that shapes the planet over geologic time, and is a primary cause of earthquakes, it is not known what causes subduction to cease, and what effect it has on the deepest portions of the crust and the upper part of the mantle.  By studying the age and composition of igneous rocks emplaced at the very end of the subduction cycle, this project seeks to understand what causes subduction to cease, and how this changes the composition and structure of the crust and upper mantle. Because this process occurs deep within the earth, the project will focus on rocks in the root of an ancient subduction zone, now exposed in the Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica. In addition, Antarctica remains relatively poorly understood, and this project will contribute directly to increasing our understanding of the geologic history of this region. The project will focus on training graduate and undergraduate students - incorporating hands-on experience with an array of state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation. Students will also gain a range of more general skills including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), written and oral communication, and data management - strengths that are highly relevant to careers both in the academic and Geosciences industry. Each summer, high school students will be incorporated into aspects of the laboratory-based research through the UCSB research mentorship program. The PI and graduate students will engage the general public through a purpose-built iPhone App and multimedia website. Activities will include live phone and video conversations from the field between elementary school students and members of the team in Antarctica. <br/><br/>The mechanisms by which the deep crustal delaminates or ""founders"" and is returned to the mantle remains a fundamental problem in earth science. Specifically, little is known about the temporal and spatial scales over which this process occurs or the mechanisms that trigger such catastrophic events. Igneous rocks highly enriched in potassium, called lamprophyres, are often emplaced during, and immediately after, termination of subduction and therefore potentially provide direct insight into foundering. These enigmatic rocks are important because they represent near-primary mantle melt compositions and therefore their age, geochemistry and petrologic evolution reveal key information on both the composition of the upper mantle and its thermal state. Of equal importance, they reveal how these key parameters vary through both space and time. By evaluating lamprophyres along a subduction zone margin it is possible to extract: 1) local-scale information, such as the timing and duration of melting and the role of igneous crystallization processes in generation of isotopic heterogeneities; 2)  along-strike variations in mantle source composition, temperature, and depth of melting  3) the plate-scale forces that control foundering and termination of subduction. This project will study a suite of lamprophyres along the axis of the Transantarctic Mountains, emplaced during the latest stages of the Neoproterozoic - Ordovician Ross orogeny, Antarctica (roughly 505 to 470 million years before present). High-precision geochronology (age determinations) will be combined with geochemical measurements on the rocks and minerals to understand the mechanisms and timing of deep crustal foundering/delamination."

Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these processes depends on our knowledge of the Arctic system and our ability to simulate its time-evolving state in a way that is consistent with observations. This project will employ an advanced approach for synthesizing oceanographic observations to develop a tool that establishes a baseline understanding of the Arctic system. Outcomes of the proposed research will include better quantification of the Arctic system's changes since the turn of the century, and improved understanding of the dynamical causes for these changes. It is likely that the resulting analyzed fields of ocean and sea ice properties will be widely utilized by the community in future research. <br/><br/>This project will bring together hydrographic observations obtained from ship, aircraft and autonomous instruments, sea ice data from in situ buoys, satellites and manned vessels, and boundary-layer meteorology within a state estimation infrastructure to develop a physical and dynamical description of the evolving Arctic Ocean during roughly the first decade of the 21st century. Taking advantage of a growing observational database, the project's two main objectives are: the creation of a dynamically-consistent and comprehensive synthesis of all available Arctic hydrographic and sea ice observations using the adjoint-based Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate for the period 2002-present; and scientific investigations, using the synthesis products, of physical mechanisms driving the evolving Arctic system. The team will quantify four key science issues: the time-average, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of the upper-ocean hydrography and circulation; the interannual changes in Arctic Ocean heat and freshwater (FW) content; changes in the sea ice state and air-sea fluxes; and connections between the Arctic and the Sub-polar gyre, focusing on heat and FW exchanges and feedback. Products generated will be the time-mean, mean seasonal cycle, and time-varying quantities in the Arctic Ocean, its neighboring seas and sub-polar North Atlantic of the full set of variables characterizing the coupled physical ocean-sea ice state, heat, FW, momentum and vorticity budgets, and inferred air-sea fluxes and time-mean oceanic turbulent mixing. These products will be made available to researchers and students, policy makers, industry, and the general public. <br/><br/>A substantial outreach activity will be undertaken, in collaboration the MIT Museum, to assemble diverse multimedia projects that use scientific results, including those from this project, to visualize changes due to ongoing major shifts in the Arctic Ocean.

Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these processes depends on our knowledge of the Arctic system and our ability to simulate its time-evolving state in a way that is consistent with observations. This project will employ an advanced approach for synthesizing oceanographic observations to develop a tool that establishes a baseline understanding of the Arctic system. Outcomes of the proposed research will include better quantification of the Arctic system's changes since the turn of the century, and improved understanding of the dynamical causes for these changes. It is likely that the resulting analyzed fields of ocean and sea ice properties will be widely utilized by the community in future research. <br/><br/>This project will bring together hydrographic observations obtained from ship, aircraft and autonomous instruments, sea ice data from in situ buoys, satellites and manned vessels, and boundary-layer meteorology within a state estimation infrastructure to develop a physical and dynamical description of the evolving Arctic Ocean during roughly the first decade of the 21st century. Taking advantage of a growing observational database, the project's two main objectives are: the creation of a dynamically-consistent and comprehensive synthesis of all available Arctic hydrographic and sea ice observations using the adjoint-based Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate for the period 2002-present; and scientific investigations, using the synthesis products, of physical mechanisms driving the evolving Arctic system. The team will quantify four key science issues: the time-average, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability of the upper-ocean hydrography and circulation; the interannual changes in Arctic Ocean heat and freshwater (FW) content; changes in the sea ice state and air-sea fluxes; and connections between the Arctic and the Sub-polar gyre, focusing on heat and FW exchanges and feedback. Products generated will be the time-mean, mean seasonal cycle, and time-varying quantities in the Arctic Ocean, its neighboring seas and sub-polar North Atlantic of the full set of variables characterizing the coupled physical ocean-sea ice state, heat, FW, momentum and vorticity budgets, and inferred air-sea fluxes and time-mean oceanic turbulent mixing. These products will be made available to researchers and students, policy makers, industry, and the general public. <br/><br/>A substantial outreach activity will be undertaken, in collaboration the MIT Museum, to assemble diverse multimedia projects that use scientific results, including those from this project, to visualize changes due to ongoing major shifts in the Arctic Ocean. The goal is to engage the general audience interested in the multimedia projects with actual scientific datasets to establish tangible links between the two perspectives.

This study will address key questions relating to the stability of the ice sheet, the subglacial hydrological system, and the deep-cold subglacial biosphere.  The education and outreach component aims to widely disseminate results to the scientific community and to the general public through short films, a blog, and a website.<br/><br/>Subglacial Lake Mercer is one of the larger hydrologically active lakes in the southern basin of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica.  It receives about 25 percent of its water from East Antarctica with the remainder originating from West Antarctica, is influenced by drain/fill cycles in a lake immediately upstream (Subglacial Lake Conway), and lies about 100 km upstream of the present grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.  This site will yield information on the history of the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams, and on grounding line migration.  The integrated study will include direct sampling of basal ice, water, and sediment from the lake in concert with surface geophysical surveys over a three-year period to define the hydrological connectivity among lakes on the Whillans Ice Plain and their flow paths to the sea. The geophysical surveys will furnish information on subglacial hydrology, aid the site selection for hot-water drilling, and provide spatial context for interpreting findings. The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis ""Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments"". The project will be undertaken by a collaborative team of scientists, with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, geophysics, glaciology, marine geology, paleoceanography, and science communication."

Observations of this region, known as the thermosphere, commonly show long periods (days to weeks) of relatively placid conditions, punctuated by large disturbances that can only be described as ""storms"". However, even quiet times exhibit a substantial and often seemingly random background of day-to-day variability. In the troposphere, large storms develop internally, without a requirement for sudden impulsive changes by externally imposed forcing or regional boundary conditions. While internal instability does also play a role in Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere (especially at low latitudes); much of the thermospheric weather is instead directly driven from outside by forcing from regions above and below. Upward propagating waves and tides make a ubiquitous contribution to the low-level day-to-day variability, whereas fluctuations in the solar radiation, solar wind, and Earth's magnetosphere dynamics drive a broad spectrum of thermospheric perturbations - and are entirely responsible for driving storms and other large events. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to understand the origins of day-to-day fluctuations in thermospheric weather, both large and small. Two state-of-the-art remote sensing instruments measuring thermospheric wind and temperature will be deployed in Antarctica, at latitudes that have been shown by previous studies to host the most extreme and complex thermospheric weather behavior. While previous work has measured thermospheric winds and temperatures across the globe for many years, there have never been instruments at these geomagnetic latitudes with anything even close to the proven sensitivity, resolution, and field of regard that are achieved by the proposed all-sky imaging design. Demonstrated performance of these new Fabry-Perot Spectrometers exceeds that of the previous generation of instruments at the Antarctic McMurdo and South Pole stations by more than two orders of magnitude, which will open revolutionary new insights in the fluid dynamics of Earth's polar-cap thermosphere. <br/><br/>This award will address a number of specific outstanding questions of aeronomical research: What is the main source of complex day-to-day variability that has been observed in the generally anti-sunward neutral flow across the polar cap? What are the mechanisms responsible for discrepancies between observed and modeled temperatures and tidal amplitudes within the polar cap? Do thermospheric gravity waves, propagating poleward from the auroral oval, deposit a significant flux of heat and/or momentum into the polar cap thermosphere? Are there any signatures of anthropogenic climate change and/or declining solar activity in the long-term record of thermospheric temperatures at South Pole?<br/><br/>Cutting-edge science, international partnership, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve the project's education and outreach goals. Anticipated broader impacts from this project include training of a Ph.D. graduate student, furthering international scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and providing real-time and archive data that will be of operational value to satellite operators, communicators, and navigators."

At present, global climate models do a poor job of predicting recent observed declines in Arctic sea ice, and the causes of this discrepancy remain unclear. One interpretation is that models may not be sensitive enough to capture the response of sea ice to greenhouse warming. However, another possibility is that natural cycles have accelerated the recent Arctic sea ice loss. Solving this problem has important implications not only for the interpretation of recent Arctic climate change but also the future projection for the Arctic, including the question as to when we will see the first ice free summer in the Arctic. The study will conduct targeted simulations and place these simulations in the context of observations over the last 117 years. As a result, we expect to better understand how well models capture naturally occurring variations of the Arctic climate and sea ice, and how we can improve models to yield more confident predictions. In addition, the study will train a graduate student and a postdoctoral scientist in polar aspects of climate science and general climate modeling and will provide outreach activities targeting K-12 students and teachers in Santa Barbara. <br/><br/>This project will help us understand and quantify how  atmospheric circulation in the Arctic influences winds, cloudiness, water vapor, radiation and thereby sea ice variability.

First, the investigators will use data assimilation techniques in a global earth system model and explore how tropical sea surface temperature contributes to the recent sea ice decline via teleconnections to the high latitudes. The investigators will then examine dynamical mechanisms that link Arctic circulation to remote drivers in the tropics and put circulation changes over the last 40 years into the context of longer centennial term changes. Finally, results will help evaluate model skill for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and determine whether the tropical drivers represent a main source of modeled internal variability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Associated with the Arctic warming and waning sea-ice cover is a reorganization of the surface and deep-water circulation of the Arctic Ocean, but understanding of the associated processes is limited. The early to mid-Holocene provides a post-glacial analogue of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, similar to scenarios that have been proposed for the next several decades. This early-mid Holocene sea ice minimum, 10?6 thousand years ago, is often attributed to changes in solar forcing. However, records providing information on upper Arctic water column stratification during episodes of minimum sea ice cover are sparse. The normal paleoceanographic proxies for water mass stratification cannot be applied in the Arctic; different approaches are required to reconstruct water column hydrography. The proposed research has the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of past Arctic water column hydrography from the early to mid-Holocene sea ice minimum and inform scenario development of future conditions in the Arctic Ocean. <br/><br/>The project will contribute to workforce development through support for the training of a PhD student.  The technology developed will be proactively transferred to the international science community through a formal workshop.  <br/><br/>Recent innovations in the combined use of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (laser-ablation ICP-MS) and Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) have shown that a wealth of environmental information about water column stratification can be extracted from single shells of fossil foraminifera. Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) (Nps), grows its chambers (ontogenetic calcite) near the Arctic surface, and subsequently sinks through the water column where it adds a thick calcite crust around the thinly calcified chambers at sub-mixed layer depths. Thus, each individual Nps shell contains chemical and isotopic zonation from waters with distinctly different physical properties ? the generally cold low salinity surface mixed layer and warmer subsurface halocline. Intrashell variability can be measured with in situ analytical approaches. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to apply a multi-instrument approach to quantify intrashell geochemistry in Nps shells obtained from an array of boxcore samples across the Arctic Ocean. They plan to combine intrashell 18O and 13C measurements in <5 m-sized domains by SIMS with analyses of Mg/Ca (proxy for temperature), Ba/Ca (proxy for river runoff or meltwater discharge), and Na/Ca (proxy for salinity) by laser-ablation ICP-MS on the same Nps shells. The innovative SIMS ultra-small domain isotope analytical approach was developed within the last few years by PI Kozdon, and calibrated in the lab of PI Spero. Both SIMS (spot-measurements) and laser-ablation data (depth profiles through the calcite layers) can be correlated to well defined domains in the foraminiferal shells that reflect a specific stage in the specimens? ontogenetic development (?time-markers?). Each of the measurements can be assigned to a general water depth range that is related to the depth of calcite addition as Nps migrates through the water column during its ontogenetic development. Thus, the proposed analytical approach provides an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct past water column stratification between the surface and halocline from individual shells of Nps in sedimentary assemblages. This innovative multi-instrument approach will be applied to mid-Holocene and late Holocene Nps shells from ~50 14C-dated box-coretop samples from the Arctic Ocean. The cores will be carefully selected, mainly from U.S. core repositories, using the following criteria: (I) good coverage of the Arctic Ocean with a focus on key-areas sensitive to changes in water mass stratification and (II) existing 14C dates, although some of the cores will still need to be dated."

There is increasing evidence that polar stratospheric variability and change can have a significant downward impact on the surface climate.  The proposed research will examine the connection between stratospheric circulation and chemistry and past and future changes in the surface climate of the Arctic region.  Understanding the coupling between the stratosphere and the surface in the Arctic region has potentially important implications for sea ice and weather forecasting.  In addition, the proposed research will lead to an improved understanding of the local and remote processes that will determine Arctic stratospheric and tropospheric ozone concentrations in the future.

Understanding subglacial hydrology, the persistence of life in extended isolation and the evolution and stability of subglacial habitats requires an integrated, interdisciplinary approach. The collaborative project, Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration (MIDGE) of the Biogeochemistry, Hydrology and Glaciology of Blood Falls, McMurdo Dry Valleys will integrate geophysical measurements, molecular microbial ecology and geochemical analyses to explore a unique Antarctic subglacial system known as Blood Falls. Blood Falls is a hypersaline, subglacial brine that supports an active microbial community. The subglacial brine is released from a crevasse at the surface of the Taylor Glacier providing an accessible portal into an Antarctic subglacial ecosystem. Recent geochemical and molecular analyses support a marine source for the salts and microorganisms in Blood Falls. The last time marine waters inundated this part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys was during the Late Tertiary, which suggests the brine is ancient. Still, no direct samples have been collected from the subglacial source to Blood Falls and little is known about the origin of this brine or the amount of time it has been sealed below Taylor Glacier. Radar profiles collected near Blood Falls delineate a possible fault in the subglacial substrate that may help explain the localized and episodic nature of brine release. However it remains unclear what triggers the episodic release of brine exclusively at the Blood Falls crevasse or the extent to which the brine is altered as it makes its way to the surface. <br/><br/>The MIDGE project aims to determine the mechanism of brine release at Blood Falls, evaluate changes in the geochemistry and the microbial community within the englacial conduit and assess if Blood Falls waters have a distinct impact on the thermal and stress state of Taylor Glacier, one of the most studied polar glaciers in Antarctica. The geophysical study of the glaciological structure and mechanism of brine release will use GPR, GPS, and a small passive seismic network. Together with international collaborators, the 'Ice Mole' team from FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Germany (funded by the German Aerospace Center, DLR), MIDGE will develop and deploy innovative, minimally invasive technologies for clean access and brine sample retrieval from deep within the Blood Falls drainage system. These technologies will allow for the collection of samples of the brine away from the surface (up to tens of meters) for geochemical analyses and microbial structure-function experiments. There is concern over the contamination of pristine subglacial environments from chemical and biological materials inherent in the drilling process; and MIDGE will provide data on the efficacy of thermoelectric probes for clean access and retrieval of representative subglacial samples. Antarctic subglacial environments provide an excellent opportunity for researching survivability and adaptability of microbial life and are potential terrestrial analogues for life habitats on icy planetary bodies. The MIDGE project offers a portable, versatile, clean alternative to hot water and mechanical drilling and will enable the exploration of subglacial hydrology and ecosystem function while making significant progress towards developing technologies for minimally invasive and clean sampling of icy systems."

The sea ice zone is an important habitat for a group of diatoms, largely from the genus Chaetoceros, that have a unique life cycle stage under environmental stress, when they produce a structure called a resting spore. Resting spores are meant to reseed the surface ocean when conditions are more favorable. The production of these heavy resting spores tends to remove significant amounts of carbon and silicon, essential nutrients, out of the surface ocean. As a result, this group has the potential to remove carbon from the surface ocean and can impact the sedimentary record scientists use to reconstruct environmental change. This project explores the role of resting spores in the sedimentary record using the nitrogen isotopic signature of these fossils and how those measurements are used to estimate carbon cycle changes. The work will include laboratory incubations of these organisms to answer if and how the chemistry of the resting spores differs from that of a typical diatom cell. The incubation results will be used to evaluate nutrient drawdown in sea ice environments during two contrasting intervals in earth history, the last ice age and the warm Pliocene. This work should have significant impact on how the scientific community considers the impact of seasonal sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean in terms of how it responds to and regulates global climate. The project provides training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Ongoing research efforts in Antarctic earth sciences will be disseminated through an interactive display at the home institution.<br/><br/>The work proposed here will address uncertainties in how Chaetoceros resting spores record surface nutrient conditions in their nitrogen stable isotopic composition, the relative impact of their specific signal with respect to the full sedimentary assemblage, and their potential to bias or enhance environmental reconstructions in the sea ice zone. Measurements of nitrogen stable isotopes of nitrate, biomass, and diatom-bound nitrogen and silicon-to-nitrogen ratios of individual species grown in the laboratory will be used to quantify how resting spores record nutrient drawdown in the water column and to what degree their signature is biased toward low nutrient conditions. These relationships will be used to inform diatom-bound nitrogen isotope reconstructions of nutrient drawdown from a Pliocene coastal polyna and an open ocean core that spans the last glacial maximum. This proposal capitalizes on the availability of Southern Ocean isolates of Chaetoceros spp. collected in 2017 for the proposed culture work and archived sediment cores and/or existing data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, it is predicted that the rate of growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food web that sustains subsistence marine harvests by native populations, will increase within the Arctic seas.  The limited amount of available nitrogen, a required nutrient for phytoplankton, eventually will restrict the level of growth.  Nitrogen gas dissolved in the ocean can be converted to a form readily utilizable by phytoplankton, but this has been considered primarily a warm-water process.  The principal investigators of this project recently have observed this process in the Arctic Ocean, but there is so little data that its extent remains highly speculative.  If it is widespread, it will change the way we think about future scenarios for the changing Arctic marine ecosystem, subsistence fishing, and, potentially, commercial fishing in the Arctic.  The project will also contribute to workforce development.  The principal investigator is an early-career, female scientist.  She will use the project as a mechanism to entrain an undergraduate student into research.  She will also use the project to sustain an existing educational collaboration between the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences and Hampton University, a historically black university.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that microorganisms capable of fixing N2 (diazotrophs) are present in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, that they produce measurable rates of N2 fixation in near shore and offshore Arctic marine waters and that diazotroph community composition will differ between coastal sites, which are influenced by terrestrial inputs, versus open water sites. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas will be sampled during a cruise in late summer 2016, when hydrographic and nutrient conditions are likely to favor diazotrophic populations. The impact that N2 fixation will have on Arctic ecosystems is dependent on its rate, spatial extent and the conditions that favor it. As a consequence, on each cruise the PIs propose to determine diazotroph community composition, examine their distributions based on the presence of the nitrogenase gene (nifH), measure rates of primary productivity and uptake of inorganic and organic N and C substrates using 15N and 13C tracer techniques, and to compare these to hydrographic, nutrient, and overall microbial community composition profiles made along cruise transects. The proposed work will determine the extent of active N2 fixation within the region in the context of other key biogeochemical and microbial community parameters."

This Early Action Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports the development of a new theory and methodology in the social sciences for investigating and understanding communities facing increasing uncertainty about their social and economic future.   Substance abuse is just one manifestation of social stress that characterizes communities where viable futures are increasingly difficult to grasp for large segments of the population.   This project is rooted in the investigator's four decades of anthropological field research in communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, and similar comparative experience in the communities of Robeson County North Carolina.   Both communities have experienced economic and social stress brought about by relocations, factory closures, and natural disasters.  However, the majority of members from each community have experienced and interpreted these events in very different ways.   The insights gained from this project hold promise for understanding the different ways communities experience social and economic uncertainty.  From these insights, the researcher hopes to gain new knowledge about the relationship between these stressors and a vision for a viable future; insights that can inform intervention methods that support community health and well-being. <br/><br/>This award supports a comparative study of communities in severe economic and social stress, seeking to understand the very different ways that the communities themselves conceptualize the causes and consequences both of the stressors and of their very different reactions to social and economic uncertainty.  This research will examine the data from two communities in the north Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with comparative research with two communities in Robeson County North Carolina.  In both places local communities, since the mid-1990s, have experienced major declines in employment and wages, plus declining social support programs.  The researcher points out that there have been locally constructed and fairly intense efforts both to help those who suffer and to mitigate the consequences of social and economic stress, yet the differences persist.  The emphasis in this research begins with seeking to understand the range of responses from community to community.  Using these circumstances as a starting point, the Principal Investigator will develop new theories and methods for the study of ""everyday life histories"" as a means for assessing locally constructed concepts of risk and uncertainty. <br/><br/>The research builds on the concept and methods for studying ""everyday histories"" first developed at the Max Planck Institute for History.  This research project further develops these concepts and methods by a examining of how people have lived and currently live within and against a history that stretches into what they see as an increasingly uncertain future. Toward this end the researcher will be reviewing and reinterpreting decades of his field notes on these communities, and further developing research methods which focus both on socially constructed silences in communities and obstacles to the social recognition of both ""open"" and ""half-hidden"" pleas for help.  The research will contribute not only to a more nuanced and powerful theory of social stress and stressors but has the potential developing a methodology for uncovering the complex relationships between stress as a social phenomenon and the negative behavioral and physical responses to it."

Cold deserts, like the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), are similar to hot deserts in that they accumulate high concentrations of salts because there is not enough water to flush the salts out of the soils into the ocean.  The accumulation of salt allows for the creation of brine-rich groundwater that freezes at much lower temperatures. Field work will focus on several groundwater features in the MDV including Don Juan Pond, a shallow lake that accumulates extremely high levels of salts and does not freeze until the temperature reaches -51 degrees C (-60 degrees F).  The setting offers the potential to better understand this unique water environment including life at its extremes. It also serves as an analog environment for Mars, a planet that is entirely underlain by permafrost, similar to the MDV. This project will support a doctoral student at the University of Washington Department of Earth and Space Sciences, who will be trained in chemical analysis, chemical and physical modeling, and remote field work in a polar desert environment.<br/><br/>Past research suggests that the movement of soluble ions in sediment and soil is controlled by the water activity, permeability, and the thermal regime; however, processes controlling the ionic redistribution in Antarctic environments are poorly constrained. This project aims to better understand the formation, salt redistribution, and water activity of pervasive brine-rich groundwater that is enriched in calcium chloride.  A primary goal is to develop a brine thermal;reactive;transport model for the MDV region using data collected from the field to constrain model inputs and ground-truth model outputs. The model will develop a Pitzer-type thermodynamic, reactive transport model and couple it to a ground temperature model.  The model will test mechanisms of groundwater formation in the MDV and the properties (e.g. composition, temperature, and water activity) of widespread shallow brine-rich waters.   Water is an essential ingredient for life and defining processes that control the availability of water is critical for understanding the habitability of extreme environments, including Mars."

The formation of this dense water has regional and global importance because it influences the ocean current system. Polynya processes are also tied to the amount of sea ice formed, ocean heat lost to atmosphere, and atmospheric CO2 absorbed by the Southern Ocean. Unfortunately, the ocean-atmosphere interactions that influence the deep ocean water properties are difficult to observe directly during the Antarctic winter. This project will combine field measurements and laboratory experiments to investigate whether differences in the concentration of noble gasses (helium, neon, argon, xenon, and krypton) dissolved in ocean waters can be linked to environmental conditions at the time of their formation. If so, noble gas concentrations could provide insight into the mechanisms controlling shelf and bottom-water properties, and be used to reconstruct past climate conditions. Project results will contribute to the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) theme of The Future and Consequences of Carbon Uptake in the Southern Ocean. The project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in environmental monitoring, and earth and ocean sciences methods. <br/><br/>Understanding the causal links between Antarctic coastal processes and changes in the deep ocean system requires study of winter polynya processes. The winter period of intense ocean heat loss and sea ice production impacts two important Antarctic water masses: High-Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW), and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which then influence the strength of the ocean solubility pump and meridional overturning circulation. To better characterize how sea ice cover, ocean-atmosphere exchange, brine rejection, and glacial melt influence the physical properties of AABW and HSSW, this project will analyze samples and data collected from two Ross Sea polynyas during the 2017 PIPERS winter cruise. Gas concentrations will be measured in seawater samples collected by a CTD rosette, from an underwater mass-spectrometer, and from a benchtop Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer. Noble gas concentrations will reveal the ocean-atmosphere (dis)equilibrium that exists at the time that surface water is transformed into HSSW and AABW, and provide a fingerprint of past conditions. In addition, nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), argon, and CO2 concentration will be used to determine the net metabolic balance, and to evaluate the efficacy of N2 as an alternative to O2 as glacial meltwater tracer. Laboratory experiments will determine the gas partitioning ratios during sea ice formation. Findings will be synthesized with PIPERS and related projects, and so provide an integrated view of the role of the wintertime Antarctic coastal system on deep water composition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It provides a natural laboratory to study a volcanic system that has been in a continuous state of activity with a persistent lava lake over at least the last 40 years. Worldwide only four other volcanoes with such long-lived lava lakes exist: Erta Ale, Ethiopia; Kilauea, Hawaii; Nyiragongo, Congo; and Ambrym, Vanuatu. These volcanoes are a rare anomaly that provide a window into the underlying magmatic system and behavior. Erebus is of particular interest as it cycles through phases of very explosive activity every 20 thousand years. This project will investigate interactions between the magmatic system, the rift it is located in, and the impact of the gravitational load the volcano imposes on the underlying crust and its own magmatic system. Possible interactions between these factors may explain the changes in activity. The project will analyze geophysical data that have been collected at Erebus over at least the last two decades. The results of this work will be available to the public and scientific community and inform geodynamic models in this region. The project funds an early-career scientist and a graduate student at New Mexico Tech and contributes to the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>The proposed work targets scientific questions recently formulated by the community during the 2016 NSF-sponsored Scientific Drivers and Future of Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory workshop. The location and geometry of the magmatic plumbing from vent to lower crust system remain poorly constrained, particularly below 1 km depth. The style and causes for changes in volcanic and magmatic activity over the short term (minutes to hours) and on the decadal scale remains enigmatic. Two decades of campaign and continuous GPS data on Ross Island will inform about the longer term dynamics of both, Ross Island growing within the Terror Rift, and Erebus? deeper magmatic system. This project will organize and analyze all existing GPS data for Ross Island, and interpret any anomalies in the resulting time series. These activities require organization, consistent processing and interpretation/modeling of the existing ~20 years of GPS data, which include campaign, continuous, and high-rate GPS observations. We will generate these position time series in a consistent local reference frame and make the results, including models of transient deformation available to the community. Volcanic, tectonic and isostatic adjustment related deformation will be modeled to place Erebus in a broad volcano-tectonic framework of West Antarctica. During the data analysis phase, the utility of existing GPS data for reflection studies of snow and sea-level dynamics will also be evaluated."

One of the best ways to catalog and understand these changes is through the study of Arctic rivers. Rivers are an excellent indicator of overall Arctic change as the water in the river at any given time (its ""discharge"") is a reflection of all of the other components of the water and energy cycles: precipitation, evaporation, and groundwater movements. However, logistical difficulties and shifting international priorities have resulted in a steep decline in gauge monitoring  network. Likewise, the unique geomorphology (the way rivers shape and are shaped by the landscape) of Arctic rivers is relatively understudied. Without advances in open source data and understanding of Arctic rivers we lack the ability to assess recent Artic changes that are affecting citizens and ecosystems alike, and our ability to accurately predict the future climate and water resources of the Arctic is greatly impaired.<br/><br/>Therefore, this project seeks an unprecedented accounting of the pan-Arctic hydrologic cycle built from the river up. The project will first develop the basic open-source river data needed to assess recent changes in Arctic hydrology and then use these data to catalog and understand the state of the Arctic's water. Specifically, the project will couple the recent explosion in big-data remote sensing and specific remote sensing discharge estimation techniques with classic fluvial geomorphology to estimate discharge for every Arctic river wider than 150m from 1984 to present using NASA's Landsat family of satellites. This remotely sensed Arctic river assessment will be founded upon a backbone of detailed fieldwork as designed and executed by undergraduates at UMass Amherst in a new program: Integrating Geosciences and Engineering in the Arctic (IGEA). IGEA participants will design and lead fieldwork intended to deepen understanding of unique Arctic geomorphology, and this information will be absorbed to improve the discharge estimates made from remote sensing. IGEA students will design field experiments in the spring semester as juniors, perform Arctic fieldwork in the summer after their junior year, and then analyze their data and train the next cohort of participants in the fall of their senior year. Undergraduates are purposefully drawn from two different disciplines, Engineering and Geosciences, to address disciplinary siloing at the undergraduate level and to train, teach, and inspire the next generation of interdisciplinary thinkers through this immersive Arctic research program. Finally, the IGEA-informed remotely sensed discharge data will be used to calibrate an open source global hydrology model, integrating the other components of this project to reach a fuller understanding of the entire Arctic system achieved through improved process-based understanding of Arctic rivers."

Before the core is even processed, data from the borehole probe will immediately determine the depth-age relationship, augment 3D mapping of South Pole stratigraphy, aid in searches for the oldest ice in Antarctica, and reveal layers of volcanic or extraterrestrial fallout.  Regarding the intellectual merit, the oriented borehole log will be essential for investigating features in the ice sheet that may have implications for ice core chronology, ice flow, ice sheet physical properties and stability in response to climate change.  The tools and techniques developed in this program have applications in glaciology, biogeoscience and exploration of other planetary bodies. The program aims for a deeper understanding of the consequences and causes of abrupt climate change. The broader impacts of the project are that it will include outreach and education, providing a broad training ground for students and post-docs.  Data and metadata will be made available through data centers and repositories such as the National Snow and Ice Data Center web portal. <br/><br/>The laser dust logger detects reproducible paleoclimate features at sub-centimeter depth scale.  Dust logger data are being used for synchronizing records and dating any site on the continent, revealing accumulation anomalies and episodes of rapid ice sheet thinning, and discovering particulate horizons of special interest.  In this project we will deploy a laser dust logger equipped with a magnetic compass to find direct evidence of preferentially oriented dust.  Using optical scattering measurements from IceCube calibration studies at South Pole and borehole logs at WAIS Divide, we have detected a persistent anisotropy correlated with flow and crystal fabric which suggests that the majority of insoluble particulates must be located within ice grains.  With typical concentrations of parts-per-billion, little is known about the location of impurities within the polycrystalline structure of polar ice.  While soluble impurities are generally thought to concentrate at inter-grain boundaries and determine electrical conductivity, the fate of insoluble particulates is much less clear, and microscopic examinations are extremely challenging.  These in situ borehole measurements will help to unravel intimate relationships between impurities, flow, and crystal fabric.  Data from this project will further develop a unique record of South Pole surface roughness as a proxy for paleowind and provide new insights for understanding glacial radar propagation.  This project has field work in Antarctica."

In the case of coastal Alaska over the past several thousand years, the available data indicate that for the most part, the answer has been ""not much"" - the marine ecosystem seems to have remained relatively stable, even through periods of climate change such as the Medieval Warm Period and the so-called ""Little Ice Age"". The one exception to this generalization is found on Unalaska Island, in the eastern Aleutians. At about 4000 years ago, ringed seals, which are an ice-adapted species, made up a significant portion of the subsistence base. This suggests that temperatures were substantially colder than they are today. However, many of the species that are common in the area today (in the absence of significant levels of sea ice) were also an important part of the subsistence economy 4000 years ago.  <br/><br/>This research aims to try to address this apparent contradiction; was it cold and icy? Or was it generally more temperate, much as it is today? To do so, the scientists will (a) study the growth patterns and shell chemistry of modern and archaeological butter clams, which will give us an indication of what the water conditions were like. They will also (b) conduct a detailed analysis of all of the species present in the archaeological midden sites, including the age composition of what was being harvested, as an indication of what the environmental conditions were like. And, finally, they will (c) conduct a detailed analysis of the artifacts associated with marine mammal hunting to determine the likelihood that hunters 4000 years ago developed a specialized toolkit for hunting in the sea ice.<br/><br/>As coastal communities throughout the Arctic face important decisions regarding the possibility of major climate change, the research team believes that it will be important to have some ""test cases"" that provide information on how various communities have responded to climate change in the past. The archaeological sites on Unalaska Island provide nearly 4000 years worth of data of adaptation to past climate change; data that are directly relevant to understanding the challenges of future climate change.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the effects of Late Holocene climate change on animal biodiversity and human foraging activity in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. This three-year, interdisciplinary study will use zooarchaeological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in Late Holocene climate significantly affected local environments, ecosystems, and human hunting strategy in the eastern Aleutian Islands. This interdisciplinary project will apply models of human foraging behavior to research human-animal-environmental interactions in the context of climate change using three major lines of evidence: 1) growth patterns and stable oxygen isotopes in archaeological shellfish will be used to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; 2) archaeological faunal material from several taxonomic groups will be used to test whether animal distribution and behavior have changed through time in response to changes in climate; 3) artifacts will be analyzed to look for adaptations to the marine mammal hunting toolkit in response to changes in climate and resource availability. More specifically, the research team proposes a research program that will use multiple datasets from Unalaska Island to address whether sea ice and ice-loving (""pagophilic"") fauna were present in this region during the Neoglacial phase, suggesting a dramatic change in prehistoric climate. The interdisciplinary nature of archaeology makes it uniquely positioned to accomplish two things: 1) to offer truly long term data about the ecological, climate, and resource histories for the Gulf of Alaska, data that are vital to understanding both ancient and contemporary human and environmental interaction in this region and 2) to collaborate with local Native Alaskan communities and students, resource managers, and cultural resource managers to collect, interpret, and disseminate the data and findings."

When permafrost warms and thaws, any buried ground ice present melts. This can lead to ground surface caving, changes in terrain, and damage to infrastructure. Permafrost thaw can also change dynamics of carbon cycling and affect near-surface hydrology causing the ground surface to become wetter or drier. To understand how fast and where permafrost is warming, this project supports the ongoing collection of high-quality, long-term data on ground temperature at more than 250 permafrost monitoring sites in Alaska, Siberia, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. To refine detection of ground warming, the investigators will supplement some monitoring sites with sensors to directly measure the heat flux between the near-surface permafrost and ground surface. To understand the relationship between permafrost warming and ground surface subsidence, the investigators will also monitor and map geomorphological changes along a transect that runs south to north across sub-Arctic and Arctic Alaska.  <br/><br/>This proposal strengthens the International Network of Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Observatories and provides the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) and the NSF Arctic Data Center with a consistent, representative, and high quality standardized long-term data series of selected permafrost parameters. This project will continue to maintain and acquire data from the existing Alaskan and Northwest Canadian network of permafrost observatories for the period 2019 to 2023; continue to develop a sustainable network of permafrost observatories in the Russian Arctic and participate in the acquisition of a comparable set of standardized data from regional observatories; participate in the implementation of the international TSP project as the US contribution to the GTN-P; continue to develop and update a joint Alaska-Russian permafrost temperature database and provide data to other data systems; and monitor the geomorphological impact of permafrost degradation at five surface observation sites.

Such a collapse would have a potentially devastating effect on the ability of the magnetic field to shield us from cosmic ray bombardment, placing our electrical grid at grave risk, among other things.  The probability of such a drastic event happening depends on the average strength of the magnetic field.  If the average is approximately equal to the present field (as many researchers assume), then the fact that the field is dropping rapidly would be more alarming than if the magnetic field is quite a bit higher than average, as implied by the current data for the ancient magnetic field from Antarctica.  The argument over the average field strength stems from the difficulty of its estimation.  The new approach advocated for in this proposal will allow researchers to obtain a robust data set for high southerly latitudes which will greatly enhance confidence in estimates of the average ancient field strength, contributing to our ability to assess the likelihood of catastrophic collapse of the geomagnetic field.  <br/><br/>The difficulty in estimating the average magnetic field strength over the past five million years is apparent when one examines data for ancient field strength as a function of latitude.  Directions of the geomagnetic field have been well approximated by an axial dipole (bar magnetic) at the center of the Earth that is aligned with the spin axis. But the signal of such an axial geomagnetic dipole, whereby the field strength doubles from the equator to the poles, is not readily apparent in the database of field strength estimates from the last five million years.  There are several possible explanations for this troubling failure: 1) combining data from different ages with possibly different average intensities leads to an inappropriate comparison of field states, 2) there is a depression of field strength at high latitude, perhaps reflecting the role of the  `tangent cylinder?, or 3) there is noise and/or bias introduced by poor selection criteria or poor experimental design.  The latter is a likely explanation as published data from the 1960 lava flow on Hawaii display the entire range of intensity values observed on the Earth's surface today, yet samples from this lava flow should all have one distinct value.  This proposal benefits from the development of new experimental methods, better field strategies and a new approach to data selection that will allow accurate estimation of the ancient field strength through a comprehensive field campaign to collect lava flow samples from previously studied outcrops targeting the most promising material.  These will be analyzed using the most robust experimental protocol and subjected to rigorous selection criteria proven to reject inaccurate results, leading to both accurate and precise estimates of ancient field strength."

The pilot proved the viability of the technique, which makes use of ringed seals who spend the majority of their time in such fjords and who may be appropriately equipped with integrated, location-tracking, CTD, and satellite communication instrumentation. The observations, which will be collected in partnership with colleagues at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, will be archived in national data bases, on a project website, and made widely available to others in near real-time. This project will address a currently missing, critical component of the Arctic Observing Network, namely observations of ocean temperatures and salinities along the periphery of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The methodology will lead to a practical, sustainable data stream for hydrographic properties in the notoriously difficult to access regions of the Greenland inner fjords, thus further filling out the overall Arctic Observing Network data portfolio.  Such observations are needed to develop improved physics that can subsequently be directly used in IPCC class, coupled climate models.  The data collection will also be of immense value to researchers studying the behavior of the ringed seals in Greenland. Virtually no behavioral data exists for these seals in the ice-ocean fjords, and the project data can be used to learn about the habitat and distribution of the seals, and ultimately of their possible vulnerability to climate change."

Rising sea level is challenging societies around the globe, but current predictions of future sea level rise contain uncertainty. Greenland's ice, if fully melted, would raise global sea levels more than 7 m. However, at present, we do not have data or models that allow for a definitive consensus view of Greenland Ice Sheet vulnerability to climate change, and our sea level predictions are only as good as our ability to model Greenland Ice Sheet change using computer simulations and the data driving those simulations. Vast datasets of observations and increasingly sophisticated computer models are being employed to solve this problem. Yet, significant knowledge and disciplinary barriers make collaboration between data and model groups the exception rather than the norm. The PIs propose to establish a community-building scientific and educational cyber hub to enable seamless access to data, and coordination and synergy between different scientific disciplines. The overarching goal is to increase the accuracy of predictions of the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea level rise by 2050, 2100 and beyond. The project will support two female PIs (one of which is a young investigator) and partial funding for two graduate students.<br/><br/>Observational datasets of Greenland Ice Sheet change, both from the satellite era and the recent geologic past, are rapidly expanding. Some of these observations have been used for calibration and validation of ice sheet models thereby improving the physical understanding of ice sheet behavior and estimates of future sea level rise. But substantial data-model gaps remain due to the knowledge barrier of understanding and using satellite- and paleo-data and the lack of a standard framework for using available observational datasets in ice sheet modeling experiments. There is significant potential to generate a long-lasting cyberinfrastructure framework with ice sheet data, software tools, online cloud-based execution and educational materials. When combined, this would lead to rapid progress in improving ice sheet modeling capability and decreasing uncertainty in sea level rise forecasting. The PIs will bring together experts in ice sheet observation, data analysis and modeling to guide the creation of a community hub that will enable two-way communication between data generators and modelers. The PIs will pilot software tools necessary to facilitate interoperability among the various data sets and modeling tools and investigate new metrics for model-data intercomparison and model assessment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much attention has focused on the loss of sea ice recorded from 2007-2012, the concomitant appearance of thousands of walruses on Alaska's and Russia's beaches, and the unfortunate consequence of large numbers of trampling mortalities.  In addition, an unusual number of walruses in poor body condition were reported on Wrangel Island in 2007, many of which subsequently died.  While walrus haul-out and mortality events are not historically isolated occurrences, these past haul-outs on Alaska's coasts, associated with reduced sea ice abundance, signify a change to this population.  These occurrences are disquieting taken together with a decrease in estimated walrus based on surveys from 2006 versus 1990, (129,000  in 2006 compared to 200,000 in 1990), and current data on reduced fertility.  The Pacific walrus is of critical importance to subsistence consumers in Alaska (and other areas of the Arctic).  Despite impressive data from in-depth studies of Pacific walruses over the last 40-50 years, it is difficult to implement proposed co-management and conservation plans based on data from such a relatively short time span, much less project the impact of additional changes to the Arctic ecosystem on both walruses and humans subsisting on them.<br/><br/>This project aims to integrate several disciplines including archaeology, ethnology, biology, and ecology using diverse sources of data including DNA, stable isotope, steroid, and trace element analysis as well as to ascertain long-term trends of walrus feeding ecology, foraging location, and stock genetics over the last two millenia. This time frame includes large climatic anomalies such as the Medieval Warm and the Little Ice Age, thereby presenting scientists with the possibility of understanding how walruses adapt during times of stress and change.  Present-day samples will be obtained from Alaskan subsistence hunters, historic samples will be acquired from museums, and prehistoric samples from archaeological collections.  Each type of data will act as a building block to better understand walruses and how they adapt to change in Arctic ecosystems.  DNA analysis will provide insights into population bottlenecks and potentially adaptive differentiation between stocks.  Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen and growth ring layers of teeth will define overall feeding ecologies of individuals through time.  Trace element analysis will reveal foraging locations, potential population structure, and changes of essential and non-essential elements over time.  Bone steroid hormones (i.e., stress hormones) can delineate population structure and health over time, and translation of historic taped interviews and use of previously archived studies will reveal traditional knowledge of walrus habitats and feeding habits over the last 100 years."

The bedrock hidden beneath this ice sheet may provide clues to how today's continents formed, while the ice itself contains records of Earth's atmosphere from distant eras. New drilling technologies are now available to allow for direct sampling of these materials from more than two kilometers below the ice surface. However, getting this material will require knowing where to look. The Southern Plateau Ice-sheet Characterization and Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (SPICECAP) project will use internationally collected airborne survey data to search East Antarctica near the South Pole for key locations that will provide insight into Antarctica's geology and for locating the oldest intact ice on Earth.  Ultimately, scientists are interested in obtaining samples of the oldest ice to address fundamental questions about the causes of changes in the timing of ice-age conditions from 40,000 to 100,000 year cycles.  SPICECAP data analysis will provide site survey data for future drilling and will increase the overall understanding of Antarctica's hidden ice and geologic records.

The SPICECAP project will train new interdisciplinary scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>This study focuses on processing and interpretation of internationally collected aerogeophysical data from the Southern Plateau of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The data include ice penetrating radar data, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetics. The project will provide information on geological trends under the ice, the topography and character of the ice/rock interface, and the stratigraphy of the ice.  The project will also provide baseline site characterization for future drilling.   Future drilling sites and deep ice cores for old ice require that the base of the ice sheet be frozen to the bed (i.e. no free water at the interface between rock and ice) and the assessment will map the extent of frozen vs. thawed areas. Specifically, three main outcomes are anticipated for this project.   First, the study will provide an assessment of the viability of Titan Dome, a subglacial highland region located near South Pole, as a potential old ice drilling prospect.  The assessment will include determining thehydraulic context of the bed by processing and interpreting the radar data,ice sheet mass balance through time by mapping englacial reflectors in the ice and connecting them to ice stratigraphy in the recent South Pole,and ice sheet geometry using laser altimetry.   Second, the study will provide an assessment of the geological context of the Titan Dome region with respect to understanding regional geologic boundaries and the potential for bedrock sampling.   For these two goals, we will use data opportunistically collected by China, and the recent PolarGAP dataset.   Third, the study will provide an assessment of the risk posture for RAID site targeting in the Titan Dome region, and the Dome C region.  This will use a high-resolution dataset the team collected previously at Dome C, an area similar to the coarser resolution data collected at Titan Dome, and will enable an understanding of what is missed by the wide lines spacing at Titan Dome.  Specifically, we will model subglacial hydrology with and without the high resolution data, and statistically examine the detection of subglacial mountains (which could preserve old ice) and subglacial lakes (which could destroy old ice), as a function of line spacing."

A variety of satellite and surface tools currently exist to help understand snow accumulation and the loss of ice from outlet glaciers or melting, but the magnitude of water vapor exchange between the interior ice sheet and the atmosphere remains essentially unknown. This vapor flux could potentially be a very large factor in calculating the mass gain or loss of the ice sheet.  Vapor flux occurs either by addition to the ice surface through vapor deposition and condensation or losses due to sublimation. This project seeks to utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, for collecting atmospheric water vapor samples to constrain vapor flux on the Greenland Ice Sheet.  A remote-controlled sampling pod containing multiple air-capture chambers and environmental sensors will be retrofitted to a commercially available multi-copter drone and flown above the ice surface to collect samples. Upon landing, the atmospheric samples will be analyzed for water isotopes, which are variations of water molecules with different molecular weights that can, for example, provide evidence of vapor flux into or away from the ice sheet. The goal of this project is to use drone-captured data to address major gaps in the understanding of frozen water storage on the Greenland ice sheet, which could reduce uncertainty in estimates of global sea level rise. The data can also be used to improve satellite algorithms used for high-latitude measurements of water isotopes; to improve general circulation models; and improve meteorological understanding of the atmosphere in general. Further, these data may also substantiate the current understanding of long-term temperature records recovered from water isotopes of polar ice cores. Initial testing and atmospheric measurements using the drone-sampling unit will occur in Summer 2018 at an ice core camp in Northeast Greenland. A second deployment in 2019 will allow for improvements to the drone-sampling unit, and a possible deployment of a fixed wing drone aircraft, for measurement of high-resolution data across the 4-month summer field season. <br/><br/>This project will result in the first drone retrofitted with a water vapor sampling pod, which can be directly analyzed in the field following flight. In doing so, the project stands to provide the first detailed and high-resolution airborne measurements of water vapor isotopes in the critical atmospheric boundary layer just above the Greenland Ice Sheet. This region is typically too expensive and dangerous for manned-flight missions, and balloon release experiments have proven logistically burdensome with limited scientific returns. This study brings together researchers from the fields of Aerospace Engineering and Geochemistry.  Students and researchers will receive drone pilot training through a Federal Aviation Administration accredited class.  Undergraduate and graduate students will receive laboratory training to assist in processing and interpreting the data. A near real-time blog for public viewing and outreach will be available during field operations, which will include field updates, selected data, photography, and film. Public lectures and scientific talks will further disseminate the knowledge learned during this project. As the technology for this project progresses, it could be transferred to other projects, such as detection of fugitive emissions from oil and gas wells or to measure methane release in regions of thawing permafrost.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fact that many of these processes are interconnected, are loosely constrained by data, and involve not only the ice, but also the atmosphere, ocean, and solid Earth, makes this a challenging endeavor, but one that is essential for Earth-system modeling and the resulting climate and sea-level forecasts that are provided to policymakers worldwide. Based on the amount of ice present in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its ability to flow and/or melt into the ocean, its complete collapse would result in a global sea-level rise of 3.3 to 5 meters, making its stability and rate of change scientific questions of global societal significance. Whether or not a collapse eventually occurs, a better understanding of the potential West Antarctic contribution to sea level over the coming decades and centuries is necessary when considering the fate of coastal population centers.  Recent observations of the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica indicate that it is experiencing faster mass loss than any other region of the continent.

But incompletely understood physical processes (e.g., basal hydrology, rheology, and sliding; tidal effects; ice-ocean interaction along the shelf and within the grounding zone) and lack of resolution in basal topography datasets making the ultimate outcome uncertain. Thus, there is a pressing need for high-resolution simulations of this region that include numerical representations of controlling physical processes (many of which are applicable elsewhere) within a higher-order ice-sheet model capable of assimilating recent observations and providing uncertainty analyses associated with model and data limitations.  By focusing on the Amundsen Sea Embayment as a connected region across the 10-10,000-meter scales using a hierarchy of one, two, and three-dimensional models along with the sensitivity analysis tools built into the Ice Sheet System Model, this project aims to produce (1) the most reliable results to date when compared with studies that consider only one ice stream or the entire ice sheet and (2) estimates of differing dynamic responses arising from errors in data, model parameterizations, and forcings.  Given the uncertainties, the project will produce a range of predictions with characteristic trends that can be recognized within future observational data sets. As new data become available, some predicted rates of change could be culled from the predictive paths generated by this study."

Confounding predictive model development are large gaps that remain in the understanding of the role albedo feedbacks are playing in sea ice loss.<br/><br/>This project will improve the understanding the impacts of solar energy absorption and partitioning on ice mass balance by tracking Arctic Observing Network (AON) sea ice sites as they move through space and time, using the rich datasets being collected at the sites as case studies. The approach integrates AON data with measurements from prior field campaigns, atmospheric reanalysis products, and high resolution remote sensing data using a 3D resolved sea ice-ocean mixed layer coupled model. The objectives are to quantify the deposition of solar energy within a 10x10km study domain around the sites with meter-scale resolution, identify the fate of that solar energy over time (e.g. ocean storage vs. ice bottom melt vs. lateral melt), and improve the ability of our resolved scale model to represent the processes controlling solar absorption and fate. The model explicitly represents critical ice and ocean processes such as melt pond formation, brine drainage, freshwater balance, and upper ocean stratification, providing a tool for data integration that can account for all first order processes impacting radiative transfer and heat storage. Important gaps in initialization datasets will be addressed by an ensemble modeling approach. Iterative comparison of site observations with model states will inform the selection of poorly constrained initial conditions, evaluate system sensitivity, and allow testing of improved model parameterizations for processes such as pond evolution."

An important part of Arctic ecosystems and Aboriginal livelihood, wild reindeer have been monitored by scientists for almost 50 years. During this time, herds have exhibited large changes in size and these changes have been recorded in almost all herds across the animal?s range. The increase in the number of wild reindeer 20-30 years ago was almost universally followed by a significant population loss in the last decade. In addition, recent monitoring revealed substantial shifts in the distribution of wild populations. The decline in wild reindeer is likely related to natural cycles and changes in the Arctic environment caused by climate change and increased anthropogenic activity. In order to explain the observed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer, it is necessary to collect long-term and seasonal observations.  The Taimyr Reindeer Herd (TRH) is both the largest and the longest monitored wild reindeer herd in Eurasia. The Extreme North Agricultural Research Institute in Noril?sk, Russia, has observed the TRH since 1969. Only a limited amount of the information on the TRH has been released, digitized, processed, analyzed or published. Much of the information is held in single-copy paper in locations and under conditions that threaten its longevity. The proposed project aims to digitize all available past records concerning the Taimyr wild reindeer populations and develop related datasets on climate and habitat over the decades of observation. <br/><br/>The Taimyr Reindeer Migration Reanalysis (TAMARA) project will be based upon a collaborative and integrated interdisciplinary international network of reindeer experts, arctic researchers, and geospatial scientists.

Building on both international and local experiences the investigators will implement a major data digitization and dissemination effort that will be a considerable contribution to the polar cyberinfrastructure pertaining to Arctic terrestrial mammals. The project has the following objectives: 1) Retrieve, digitize, archive, transfer, process and publish historical observational data collected between 1969 and 2009, document relevant methodologies, and develop appropriate metadata; 2) Develop value-added data products resulting from the (re)analysis of historical spatial migration patterns of the TRH; and 3) Contribute to developing polar spatial cyberinfrastructure by creating a comprehensive and open data visualization and data dissemination system. The TAMARA project will be an integral part of the worldwide network of reindeer observation programs. The project will involve US and Russian scientists and students, supporting one graduate student and two part-time undergraduates.

The fact that many of these processes are interconnected, are loosely constrained by data, and involve not only the ice, but also the atmosphere, ocean, and solid Earth, makes this a challenging endeavor, but one that is essential for Earth-system modeling and the resulting climate and sea-level forecasts that are provided to policymakers worldwide. Based on the amount of ice present in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its ability to flow and/or melt into the ocean, its complete collapse would result in a global sea-level rise of 3.3 to 5 meters, making its stability and rate of change scientific questions of global societal significance. Whether or not a collapse eventually occurs, a better understanding of the potential West Antarctic contribution to sea level over the coming decades and centuries is necessary when considering the fate of coastal population centers.  Recent observations of the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica indicate that it is experiencing faster mass loss than any other region of the continent.  At present, the long-term stability of this embayment is unknown, with both theory and observations suggesting that collapse is possible.  This study is focused on this critical region.

At that same time, global sea level was elevated by ~6-9 m, relative to present, according to studies of exposed corals in Australia, the Seychelles, and the Caribbean.   Such high sea level today would displace up to 20% of the US population. It is estimated that Greenland glacial melting could have accounted for ~2 m of sea-level rise, thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of mountain glaciers could account for ~0.5 m each, but Antarctica must account for the bulk of it. Where did the melting occur?  It has been speculated that the one particular part of Antarctica (the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, WAIS) was the site of the inferred melting. The marine sediments that have accumulated off-shore West Antarctica should provide evidence of this melting, but the lack of robust age control in Antarctic marine sediments has stymied their interpretation in terms of past instability of WAIS. This proposal tests a relatively new method, involving the recording of the past geomagnetic field by the sediments themselves, that can provide age models for the Antarctic marine sediments, contribute their interpretation in terms of instability of WAIS over the last few climate cycles, and hence contribute to our current climate/sea level dilemma.  <br/><br/>Over the last 20 years, relative (geomagnetic) paleointensity (RPI) proxies have been combined with oxygen isotope data in Quaternary sediments in the North Atlantic with the objective of implementing RPI as a high-resolution stratigraphic correlation tool.  The relatively rapid rate of change of geomagnetic field intensity (currently about 5% per century), and the fact that sediments with sedimentation rates <~50 cm/kyr are likely to record only the main axial dipole component of the field, means that RPI can be expected to provide a high-resolution global correlation tool. There are now several examples of tandem correlations involving RPI and oxygen isotope data over the last few Myrs, implemented through automated matching protocols such as 'Match'. The results have led to the generation of temporally calibrated reference stacks for RPI (such as PISO) that can be used, in conjunction with oxygen isotope data, to provide improvements in the resolution of Quaternary stratigraphies. This proposal is to test the use of RPI as a stratigraphic tool in marine sediment drifts off the Antarctic Peninsula and in the Bellingshausen Sea, using seven piston cores recovered in early 2015 during cruise JR298 of the RRS James Clark Ross.  The west Antarctic region provides an important test of the stratigraphic role of relative paleointensity (RPI) proxies because the sedimentation history of Antarctic sediment drifts is a key to interpreting their sedimentation history in terms of instability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS). The paucity of foraminiferal carbonate at high southerly latitudes means that age models in sediments from the region cannot rely on oxygen isotope data. Age models in these Antarctic drifts have relied on the association of high biogenic siliceous/carbonate percentage (as well as proxies for high biogenic content from magnetic susceptibility, wet bulk density and biogenic Ba content) with interglacial marine isotopic stages.  These methodologies are not ideal because they have low resolution and impose interpretations on the sediment record. For these reasons, we seek new methods for determining age in these drift sediment using RPI to interpret sedimentation rates, XRF core scanning data, and ice-rafting debris (IRD) proxies, in terms of instability of WAIS and APIS.  This project will be assisted by an undergraduate researcher."

Sea surface height is one of the ten Global Ocean Observing Systems (GOOS) Essential Ocean Variables. It is important as the measure of long-term sea level rise and on shorter time scales, tides and storm surges. The difference between sea surface height and the height of the geoid is dynamic ocean topography (DOT), which constitutes the surface pressure gradient that drives geostrophic surface velocity, a second GOOS Essential Ocean Variable. DOT observations are combined with density profiles, such as measured by oceanographic buoys (e.g., Argo floats in temperate oceans and Ice Tethered Profilers in ice-covered seas) to infer velocity shear, which makes it possible to measure absolute water velocity versus depth, a third GOOS Essential Ocean Variable. In ice-covered seas, except during high winds, the sea ice drift (Vice) largely follows the geostrophic surface velocity (Vgeo). The difference between Vice and Vgeo plays an increasingly critical role in stabilizing the doming of the Beaufort Sea Gyre in the Arctic Ocean. Furthermore, cross-shelf gradients in DOT drive secondary circulations (e.g., upwelling and downwelling) responsible for shelf-basin exchanges, which are critical to maintaining the Arctic Ocean cold halocline. Observations of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) content are needed to understand changes in atmospheric conditions globally and in the Arctic in particular. Observations of tropospheric precipitable water vapor content are needed to understand changes in atmospheric conditions, the global water cycle, and water vapor as the dominant greenhouse gas. This is particularly true over the Arctic Ocean where such observations by other means are largely non-existent. Condensed water vapor (in clouds) reflects incoming solar radiation and traps long-wave radiation near the surface, making soundings of moisture content critical to understanding the role of clouds in the surface heat budget, the water cycle, atmospheric dynamics, and their effect on sea ice, operational weather forecasts, and radio propagation. PWV content in clouds reflects incoming solar radiation and traps long-wave radiation near the surface, making soundings of moisture content critical to understanding the role of clouds in the surface heat budget, the water cycle, atmospheric dynamics, and their effect on sea ice. These effects are critical in operational forecasts of weather and radio propagation. In spite of the importance of DOT and PWV content, wholly autonomous in situ measurements of these variables have not been made. Satellite altimeters greatly expand the areal coverage of DOT observations, but in situ DOT and PWV content observations are critical to provide ground truth for the satellites and fill high-frequency temporal gaps.<br/><br/>The Applied Physics Lab (APL) will build six DOT Buoys combining the Iridium data telemetry, power systems, and ice-capable buoy hull of a proven APL drifting buoy with a dual-frequency GPS receiver similar to what is used in a proven moored internally recording GPS buoy built by partners at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Past data from the PMEL buoy will be used to design the optimum sampling strategy for the DOT Buoy. Partners at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) will perform the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) processing. APL and JPL will evaluate the DOT Buoy performance and facilitate application of the buoys to planned ONR (SODA, SIZRS), NASA (ICESat-2, SWOT), and NOAA (IABP) programs in 2019-2021. The DOT Buoys will use precision dual-frequency GPS and PPP processing of GPS data to determine DOT to 1-cm accuracy and PWV to 1-mm accuracy. PPP and the dual frequency capability of the receiver address the key sources of GPS errors. PPP processing relies on a worldwide array of stationary GPS receivers to determine the errors in GPS satellite orbits and clocks. Corrections for these errors will be applied to raw code and phase information from the DOT Buoy GPS receptions to derive positions good to 1-cm accuracy. However, this requires that full code and phase information must be telemetered from the drifting buoy for post processing with 1-week latency. The basic hardware and PPP scheme are well proven. The challenge is to design an Iridium telemetry system and sampling strategy that measure DOT and Precipitable Water Vapor content at appropriate spatial and temporal scales and buffers the data for transmission through an Iridium data link. The proposed buoys will be suitable for surface or air deployment in sea ice or open water. The buoys will immediately enhance research in the Arctic Ocean by a number of federal agencies (ONR, NASA, NOAA, NSF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Antarctic ice sheet rises into the atmosphere more than 2 kilometers above sea level, affecting atmospheric circulation in the same way a large mountain range does. Changes in ice sheet size in the past would have caused changes in atmospheric circulation, and hence climate, that should be detectable in paleoclimate data from ice and sediment cores. The project will examine the evidence for past ice sheet changes using a comparison of such data with results from numerical climate model experiments.  The intellectual merit of this project is that knowing how the Antarctic ice sheet may have changed during previous warm periods is fundamental to understanding the response of ice sheets to climate change. There is evidence that West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) may already be in the beginning stages of collapse. The broader impact is that the outcomes of this research will inform projections of how much, and how fast, the WAIS may change in the future. The project is a joint effort between the University of Washington (Seattle, USA) and the British Antarctic Survey (Cambridge, U.K.), and is the result of independent and complementary efforts by groups from both institutions. The project will support two postdocs, and will help to encourage further international cooperative and multi-disciplinary research in this area.<br/><br/>This project, submitted under the NSF/GEO-UK NERC lead agency opportunity (NSF 14-118) and the Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) solicitation, will use a combination of existing paleoclimate data and new model simulations to examine the influence of a changing Antarctic ice sheet on climate. Model-data comparisons will be used to test the hypothesis that a collapse of the WAIS occurred during the last interglacial period, and to evaluate whether the timing and rate of WAIS collapse can be constrained through the acquisition of new ice core records from Antarctica. Multiple, high-resolution, fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) will be used to create an ensemble of simulations that include varying scenarios for Antarctic ice sheet change. The project will use the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), the Hadley Centre Couple Model version 3 (HadCM3), and the Max Planck institute model, ECHAM5. Using multiple models improves understanding of the key processes and provides a critical measure of the influence of model biases on the model-data comparison."

Despite their importance to climate, direct measurements of these gases in the atmosphere are limited to the last 50 years at best.  Air trapped in ice cores extends those data back hundreds of millennia, and measurements of greenhouse gases in ice cores underpin much of our understanding of global chemical cycles relevant to modern climate change.  Existing records vary in quality and detail. The proposed work fills gaps in our knowledge of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide over the last 10,000 years.  New measurements from an ice core from the South Pole will be used to determine what role changes in ocean and land based processes played in controlling these gases, which decreased during the first 2,000 years of this time period, then gradually increased toward the present.  The work will address a major controversy over whether early human activities could have impacted the atmosphere, and provide data to improve mathematical models of the land-ocean-atmosphere system that predict how future climate change will impact the composition of the atmosphere and climate.  <br/><br/>For nitrous oxide the work will improve on existing concentration records and provide a novel, detailed Holocene stable isotope record.  It will also develop measurement of the isotopomers of nitrous oxide and explore their utility for understanding aspects of the Holocene nitrous oxide budget.  The primary goal is to determine if marine and/or terrestrial emissions of nitrous oxide change in response to changes in Holocene climate.  A new Holocene isotopic record for carbon dioxide (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes), will improve the precision of existing records by a factor 5 and increase the temporal resolution.  These data will be used to evaluate controversial hypotheses about why carbon dioxide concentrations changed in the Holocene and provide insight into millennial scale processes in the carbon cycle, which are not resolved by current isotopic data.  A graduate student will receive advanced training during and the student and principle investigator will conduct outreach efforts targeted at local middle school students.  The proposed work will also contribute to teaching efforts by the PI and to public lectures on climate and climate change.  The results will be disseminated through publications, data archive, and the OSU Ice Core Lab web site. New analytical methods of wide utility will also be developed and documented."

The Maritime Archaic peoples (ca. 6,000 B.C.-1,000 B.C.) were the first to colonize the Eastern Subarctic and Arctic of North America. They created a way of life that allowed them to successfully occupy the entire coast and near interior of Newfoundland and Labrador for thousands of years, and maintain relationships with contemporaneous cultures that stretched throughout much of northeastern North America. However, we still know very little about their initial settlement of the region, their early social organization, and the ways these processes were affected by ecological factors. The aim of this research is to examine the initial settlement of Newfoundland within the larger context of the peopling of northeastern North America and the roles that historical processes, both cultural and environmental, played in that broader framework. This will include new archaeological excavations at early Maritime Archaic sites in Newfoundland, as well as investigation and analysis of existing Maritime Archaic artifact collections from throughout the region. It will also examine ecological data, such as plant and animal remains, to assess the wider role of environmental change in the initial occupation of the eastern Subarctic and how early cultural adaptations developed within northern coastal and island ecosystems. <br/><br/>This project is an international collaboration of professional archaeologists, graduate students, and undergraduates. The training and education of undergraduate students is a critical component of this project. Moreover, project members will continue to collaborate with local communities to develop economic and preservation initiatives related to the archaeological sites and cultural heritage associated with this research and to create educational opportunities for students and community members in the region. <br/><br/>This research will have extensive implications for our understanding of how and when people first settled the easternmost region of North America, and northern coasts and islands more generally. The earliest human migration onto any landscape is a complex, interactive, and dynamic historical process. In North America, the colonization process is often generalized within an evolutionary perspective that envisions humans simply reacting to ecological opportunities offered by newly available landscapes and resources at the end of the last Ice Age. It is also often framed as solely a Paleoindian process that did not extend far into the Holocene, despite the fact that large portions of northern North America were not colonized until the Middle Holocene. New archaeological fieldwork and collections analysis concerning the Archaic expansion onto and around the island of Newfoundland will inform larger models of human colonization within the region, as well as in other Arctic and Subarctic coastal zones. This includes the initial peopling of North America on the other side of the continent and the role that northern coasts and islands played in that process. It will also help us better understand the interaction between Archaic people and their environment and the adaptation strategies they employed in unknown coastal and island landscapes, as well as the relative impact they had on those environments. <br/><br/>To address these issues the research team will survey and date extant collections to fine-tune the chronological resolution of the initial colonization processes of Newfoundland. They will also conduct new excavations at the Stock Cove and Stock Cove West sites in eastern Newfoundland where Maritime Archaic deposits have been found that appear to stratigraphically correlate to their earliest occupations of the region and that have the first evidence of architecture by Archaic peoples on the island. This will be assessed with a suite of new dates and analyses of material remains recovered from those excavations. Additionally, new geophysical surveys employing ground penetrating radar and magnetometry will be conducted to locate new Archaic deposits to help focus the excavations and noninvasively assess other archaeological deposits that could address the earliest settlement of Newfoundland. Finally, ecological data (e.g. insects, faunal remains, macrobotanicals) will be collected and analyzed to help reconstruct environmental patterns that may have impacted and influenced the peopling and settlement process by the Maritime Archaic. <br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts that include: 1) the first excavation and analysis of a Maritime Archaic structure on the island of Newfoundland; 2) the contribution of important data to our understanding of Archaic social organization and settlement in the eastern Subarctic/Arctic; 3) obtaining key environmental data that will assist with the assessment of environmental change throughout the Holocene and may inform the development of modern policies regarding the mitigation of environmental change and economic impacts (e.g., sea mammal hunting, fishing quotas, wildlife conservation, sea ice extent, coastal erosion); 4) the training of undergraduate students in archaeological field and laboratory methods; 5) international dissemination of our results to both academic and public audiences, and; 6) increased interaction with local communities, regional museums, and other interested parties within Newfoundland and Labrador concerning their heritage and cultural resources, including public lectures and the development of educational tools (e.g., social media, historical markers, pamphlets, booklets) for those communities."

Permafrost is experiencing large changes stemming from the unprecedented degree of environmental change being observed in the Arctic. Changes in the permafrost system have profound effects on the ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, and human occupation of cold environments. The main indicators of permafrost stability are permafrost temperature and thickness of the active-layer (layer of earth materials between the ground surface and the top of the permafrost that undergoes an annual cycle of freezing and thawing). These parameters are considered to be Essential Climatic Variables (ECVs) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the Global Terrestrial Observing Network (GTOS). The Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program represents the only coordinated program providing collection, standardization, open access, and dissemination of active-layer data world-wide. Widespread, systematic changes in the thickness of the active layer could have profound effects on the flux of greenhouse gases, on the human infrastructure in cold regions, and on landscape and hydrologic processes. It is therefore critical that observational and analytical procedures continue over decadal periods to assess trends and detect cumulative, long-term changes. This award will support the continuation of the active-layer observations conducted by the CALM program at the network of 168 sites distributed over circumpolar Arctic region. CALM program is an integral part of the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost. <br/><br/>Long-term observations of active-layer thickness and dynamics, obtained using standard measurement protocols, are the essential rationale behind the CALM project. Local site conditions and seasonal variations in climate create complex interactions that determine the magnitude of seasonal soil thaw and information about related biogeochemical processes. Long-term time series of thaw measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions are required to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models. Measurement of thaw subsidence, which are critical for identifying potential threats to human infrastructure in the Arctic, is an integral part of the observation program. The objectives of the observational network stress the need for long-term active layer, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements, integration of data to provide the basis for comprehensive assessments of changes in active-layer and near-surface permafrost, and preparation and dissemination of data sets to assist detailed process studies, and in validating and developing of climate change, ecology, hydrology, and geocryology models. The geographical focus of the network of CALM grids and soil temperature sites is on Arctic tundra environments, where the program has made a substantial progress at building a consistent, long-term database that has been used effectively and extensively by the modeling community. Although this project is concerned only with observing stations located in the Arctic region, it is important to note that CALM is a global network incorporating observatories outside the Arctic Circle, including a rapidly developing Antarctic component (CALM-South). More than half of the sites in the CALM network are maintained and data reported on a voluntary basis. Educational and outreach activities are an integral part of the proposed research. The project will provide opportunities for field experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary school through postdoctoral. The circum-Arctic nature of CALM will foster extensive international collaboration between students involved in project activities.

While impressive, it is difficult to assess the significance of these very recent records in the context of longer term variability, since the continuous satellite record only dates back to 1978. The limited length of the continuous sea ice record, is a significant confounding factor in ascertaining whether the observed current changes are due to natural variability alone, or represent a forced anthropogenic response.

Using satellite tracking devices the team will examine the movement and diving behavior of leopard seals and couple this information with measurements of their physiological capacity.  The project will determine whether leopard seals- who feed on diverse range of prey- are built differently than their deep diving relatives the Weddell and elephant seal who feed on fish and squid.  The team will also determine whether leopard seals are operating at or near their physiological capability to determine how much, if any, ?reserve capacity? they might have to forage and live in changing environments.   A better understanding of their home ranges, movement patterns, and general behavior will also be informative to help in managing human-leopard seal interactions. The highly visual nature of the data and analysis for this project lends itself to public and educational display and outreach, particularly as they relate to the changing Antarctic habitats. The project will use the research results to educate the public on the unique physiological and ecological adaptations to extreme environments seen in diving marine mammals, including adaptations to exercise under low oxygen conditions and energy utilization, which affect and dictate the lifestyle of these exceptional organisms.

This project seeks to better understand the ability of the leopard seal to cope with a changing environment.  The project will first examine the foraging behavior and habitat utilization of leopard seals using satellite telemetry. Specifically, satellite telemetry tags will be used to obtain dive profiles and movement data for individuals across multiple years. Diet and trophic level positions across multiple temporal scales will then be determined from physiological samples (e.g., blood, vibrissae, blubber fatty acids, stable isotopes, fecal matter). Oceanographic data will be integrated with these measures to develop habitat models that will be used to assess habitat type, habitat utilization, habitat preference, and home range areas for individual animals.  Diet composition for individual seals will be evaluated to determine whether specific animals are generalists or specialists. Second, the team will investigate the physiological adaptations that allow leopard seals to be apex predators and determine to what extent leopard seals are working at or near their physiological limit. Diving behavior and physiology of leopard seals will be evaluated (for instance the aerobic dive limit for individual animals and skeletal muscle adaptations will be determined for diving under hypoxic conditions). Data from time-depth recorders will be used to determine foraging strategies for individual seals, and these diving characteristics will be related to physiological variables (e.g., blood volume, muscle oxygen stores) to better understand the link between foraging behavior and physiology. The team will compare myoglobin storage in swimming muscles associated with both forelimb and hind limb propulsion and the use of anaerobic versus aerobic metabolic systems while foraging."

Previous studies have shown that particulate organic carbon (POC; fixed organic matter) seasonally builds up around the productive Antarctic seas before moving off-shore.  The project will serve as a step toward better quantifying the export of POC from around the Antarctic Peninsula and better understanding the larger Southern Ocean carbon cycle. The project will promote education by supporting graduate and  undergraduate students. New data sets on offshore transport pathways and POC variability will be generated in a consistent and systematic manner, and will be available to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This proposal will examine the offshore export of particulate organic carbon (POC) off the Antarctic Peninsula, from areas of high accumulation near the coast to areas offshore.  We hypothesize that both wind-driven surface Ekman transport and transport by nonlinear mesoscale eddies can make significant contributions to the offshore export of POC. Specifically, the project will (1) identify areas of enhanced accumulation of POC off the Antarctic Peninsula; (2) quantify spatial and temporal variability in offshore transport by nonlinear mesoscale eddies and by winds in a surface Ekman layer; and (3) compare the estimates of offshore transport to the POC distribution away from the coast to identify preferred transport pathways or hotspots for offshore export of coastal water and POC off the Peninsula. This study will utilize decade-long satellite observations of POC based on algorithms validated against in situ data, ocean vector winds, eddy kinematic and propagation characteristics based on altimeter data, and results from a high resolution eddy resolving ocean model coupled to a sea ice model. The study will focus on the Antarctic Peninsula during summer, when reduced cloud/sea ice cover when satellite data availability is high."

Rather than viewing place names as lists of disassociated points, the integrative approach adopted here reveals connections between configurations of named places and socio-ecological dimensions of landscape, thus providing insights into biological and cultural diversity, adaptation and resilience, and cultural values and ecosystem services within the context of environmental change. In particular, this project provides a foundation for biocultural diversity research at the local level, avoiding subjectively-defined ethnic and linguistic boundaries. By comparing current and traditional resource use, ecosystem services can be understood, helping to inform policy and management decisions.<br/><br/>The open and extensible platform developed by this project will provide a foundation for use by both researchers and community members.  The web-based platform and associated mobile apps provided can be easily navigated by K-12 students, yielding opportunities to incorporate geographic and environmental learning directly into the classroom. At the same time, the project framework has full GIS capabilities, allowing users to access geolinguistic datasets with analytical tools of their own choosing.   The long-term institutional commitments by the two collaborating institutions positions this project to grow into the standard repository for Indigenous place name data in Alaska."

In the Arctic, six massive rivers capture freshwater runoff from two-thirds of the land area that drains to the Arctic Ocean.  The chemistry of this runoff reflects watershed characteristics (e.g. soil composition), and carries essential nutrients to the marine environment.  The overarching scientific objective of the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) is to make sustained observations of the chemistry of these six large rivers, which is vital for assessing changes on land that subsequently impact physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Arctic Ocean. The project involves partnerships with the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council, The Pilot Station Traditional Council, the Gwichya Gwich?in Renewable Resource Council, and with the University of Alaska at Kuskowkwin community college that serves the largely Yup?ik residents of the Yukon-Kuskowkwim Delta. . <br/><br/>The six rivers included in the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory are the Yukon and Mackenzie in North American and the Ob?, Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma in Eurasia.  The rivers will be sampled near their mouths, every two months for three years, using identical sample collection and preservation protocols.  Approximately 40 parameters will be measured on all samples including dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations and isotopic compositions, concentrations of dissolved nutrients, major ions, and trace elements, and optical properties of dissolved organic matter, including UV absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices.  For QA/QC purposes, every analysis will be conducted at a single laboratory.  The resulting data, along with complementary data on river discharge, will be made available without restriction at the Arctic-GRO website (arcticgreatrivers.org) and through the NSF Arctic Data Center.  Arctic-GRO data, which build on observatory records that extend back to 2003, provide valuable end-members for the oceanographic research community as well as for analyses of terrestrial landscape change."

Surges are brief events during which these rates increase up to 100 times greater than the normal flow rate. Surges, which typically last between a few months and a few years on any given glacier, occur at intervals of decades to centuries. Therefore, few detailed observations of surges are available for study. Negribreen, one of the largest glaciers in Svalbard, has started to surge last summer. This project will collect different data sets that will be used with satellite data to characterize the surging glacier.  The project will contribute to STEM workforce development by supporting the training of a graduate student and an undergraduate student. Observations from this project will be added to an existing website and to develop presentations for the K-12 community.<br/><br/>A combination of observations (laser altimetry, video, GPS data, photographs from small aircraft, and satellite data) and recently developed analysis approaches will be used to develop an understanding of glacier response (deformation, crevassing, acceleration, surge progression in the glacier system, elevation change and mass transfer) to surge dynamics. The principal investigator has been studying the 2011-2013 and 1993-1995 surges of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System, Alaska, using similar techniques and numerical modeling. Bering Glacier is a warm-based glacier and Negribreen a cold-based glacier. Results from the two systems will be compared and contrasted. It is anticipated that characteristics of surges common to different climate conditions may be isolated from those dependent upon specific environmental conditions."

In the face of accelerated ice sheet contribution to sea level rise, it remains uncertain how the GrIS will adjust to a warming Arctic, declining sea ice and related changing precipitation patterns. This is a concern, given that future sea level rise is strongly dependent on the GrIS response to arctic change. The scientific community is currently undecided between a model of a dynamic GrIS that becomes greatly reduced during warm periods and a model where it is relatively stable, even through periods warmer than today. This proposal addresses the idea that increased arctic precipitation offsets GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperature. The researchers will test this by contributing significant new information on arctic system change and related GrIS dynamics during past and ongoing warm periods, and employing an ice sheet modeling effort synthesizing all new data aimed at both past and future GrIS simulations. The researchers explicitly combine multiple scientific disciplines to provide a better understanding of how key arctic system components such as precipitation, temperature, sea-ice cover and GrIS mass balance are interconnected. The results will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise.<br/><br/>This project will train six graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher. The cross-cutting research program is paralleled by the scope of the outreach plan, to develop a variety of deliverables, including development of an iBook and public outreach events. In addition the team will participate in public outreach events in Buffalo and New York City,  where the public and scientists interact in a casual setting. Finally, this work has synergies with ongoing missions at NASA and other programs within the NSF.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Due to recent advances in numerical ice sheet models and new sub-ice topography of Greenland, combined with finely-tuned field approaches and geochronologic techniques, the time is ripe for a coordinated, cross-disciplinary effort focusing on cryosphere variability in a warming Arctic; the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and sea ice constitute the largest, and most critical components of the arctic cryosphere. The hypothesis that increased arctic precipitation can counterbalance GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperatures stems from recent findings suggesting that it may be more stable than expected during interglacials. The researchers will: generate new GrIS margin reconstructions during and since the mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum (9,000 to 5,000 years ago), with a powerful approach that combines lake sediment stratigraphy with new sub-ice topography and novel high-sensitivity cosmogenic isotope methods; develop new Holocene climate reconstructions of moisture, temperature and sea ice conditions from lake and ocean sediments and an advanced synthesis of existing arctic ice core and other paleoclimate data; and employ state-of-the-art numerical ice sheet modeling fueled by ice margin and climate reconstructions to test a range of climatic and dynamic controls on GrIS change. If the idea is supported, then it would suggest a relatively stable GrIS during warm periods. If, however, this project provides evidence that the GrIS retreated considerably during the warmer-than-present mid-Holocene and in turn, that the GrIS has reacted more sensitively to temperature than to precipitation change, the results would support a tightly coupled ice sheet size-temperature link and in turn, a much greater near-term GrIS contribution to sea level rise. Either result will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise."

The area-integrated total sea ice extent grew to record maximum values in four of the last six years, yet the 2015-16 summer was marked by record low ice cover. While impressive, it is difficult to assess the significance of these very recent records in the context of longer term variability, since the continuous satellite record only dates back to 1978. The limited length of the continuous sea ice record, is a significant confounding factor in ascertaining whether the observed current changes are due to natural variability alone, or represent a forced anthropogenic response. As a result, the scientific understanding of the Antarctic sea ice trends remains poor, as does confidence in projections of future Antarctic sea ice trends. <br/><br/>To address this challenge, this project seeks to reconstruct sea ice extent and sea ice concentration, using the relationships between satellite-observed sea ice, sea level pressure, tropical sea surface temperature, ENSO indices, some proxy data (ice cores, etc.), and in situ Southern Ocean temperature data.

This project focuses on the study of emissions from arctic tundra wildfires. Chemical tracers of wildfires, including carbon monoxide, methane, and a series of volatile organic compounds will be monitored in the atmosphere at the Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit), which, while considered one of the most pristine and remote locations in the Northern Hemisphere, has previously been shown to receive fire plumes from coastal Greenland and other arctic regions further away.  Observations will be applied in modeling research to assess the impacts of the increasing frequency and geographical extent of fires on the arctic environment and lower latitudes.<br/><br/>This project will deliver continuous high time resolution data for wildfire emission and climate forcing atmospheric constituents at GEOSummit.  All data will be submitted to the Arctic Data Center for worldwide dissemination.  Data analyses and modeling will improve assessments of fire emissions and their environmental and climate impacts.

In the face of accelerated ice sheet contribution to sea level rise, it remains uncertain how the GrIS will adjust to a warming Arctic, declining sea ice and related changing precipitation patterns. This is a concern, given that future sea level rise is strongly dependent on the GrIS response to arctic change. The scientific community is currently undecided between a model of a dynamic GrIS that becomes greatly reduced during warm periods and a model where it is relatively stable, even through periods warmer than today. This proposal addresses the idea that increased arctic precipitation offsets GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperature. The researchers will test this by contributing significant new information on arctic system change and related GrIS dynamics during past and ongoing warm periods, and employing an ice sheet modeling effort synthesizing all new data aimed at both past and future GrIS simulations. The researchers explicitly combine multiple scientific disciplines to provide a better understanding of how key arctic system components such as precipitation, temperature, sea-ice cover and GrIS mass balance are interconnected. The results will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise.<br/><br/>This project will train six graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher. The cross-cutting research program is paralleled by the scope of the outreach plan, to develop a variety of deliverables, including development of an iBook and public outreach events. In addition the team will participate in public outreach events in Buffalo and New York City,  where the public and scientists interact in a casual setting. Finally, this work has synergies with ongoing missions at NASA and other programs within the NSF.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Due to recent advances in numerical ice sheet models and new sub-ice topography of Greenland, combined with finely-tuned field approaches and geochronologic techniques, the time is ripe for a coordinated, cross-disciplinary effort focusing on cryosphere variability in a warming Arctic; the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and sea ice constitute the largest, and most critical components of the arctic cryosphere. The hypothesis that increased arctic precipitation can counterbalance GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperatures stems from recent findings suggesting that it may be more stable than expected during interglacials. The researchers will: generate new GrIS margin reconstructions during and since the mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum (9,000 to 5,000 years ago), with a powerful approach that combines lake sediment stratigraphy with new sub-ice topography and novel high-sensitivity cosmogenic isotope methods; develop new Holocene climate reconstructions of moisture, temperature and sea ice conditions from lake and ocean sediments and an advanced synthesis of existing arctic ice core and other paleoclimate data; and employ state-of-the-art numerical ice sheet modeling fueled by ice margin and climate reconstructions to test a range of climatic and dynamic controls on GrIS change. If the idea is supported, then it would suggest a relatively stable GrIS during warm periods. If, however, this project provides evidence that the GrIS retreated considerably during the warmer-than-present mid-Holocene and in turn, that the GrIS has reacted more sensitively to temperature than to precipitation change, the results would support a tightly coupled ice sheet size-temperature link and in turn, a much greater near-term GrIS contribution to sea level rise. Either result will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise."

Models estimate that the Ross Sea sector was one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise from Antarctica as the ice sheet adjusted during the past ten thousand years from the glacial period to the Holocene. In this sector, ice flow into the embayment comes through West Antarctic ice streams and through East Antarctic outlet glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains. Observational data constrain the last glacial maximum and the Holocene retreat, but models are necessary to understand the environmental conditions needed for outlet glaciers to reach observed high stands, to fit the observed patterns of retreat, and to understand how the contribution of ice from West Antarctica and from East Antarctica changed over time.<br/><br/>The investigators will use available geological and geophysical data in combination with forward ice-flow models and inverse models to investigate the evolution of the four Transantarctic outlet glaciers where sufficient data exist. The objectives of this new modeling are to constrain the glaciological conditions necessary for these glaciers to thicken during the last glacial, thin during the Holocene, and reach their present-day state. By testing specific hypotheses this work contributes to an interdisciplinary effort to understand Holocene deglaciation of the Ross Sea Embayment. In addition, the modeling will address the resolving power of the available data to answer key questions for each target glacier. Broader impacts include mentoring a graduate student, public outreach, incorporation of research into high-school and university classes, and support of an early-career investigator."

Many physical processes at a range of time and space scales determine this mass loss, but their relative roles in net loss or gain and trends are poorly understood. This project will investigate the physics of glacier-ocean interaction for a specific system, Petermann Gletscher (PG), using data to improve understanding of processes at the marine margin of PG that drains a large fraction of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) into a deep fjord connected to Nares Strait via a floating, up to 1800 feet thick, ice shelf. The ice shelf has undergone significant retreat in the last few years, from 80 km long in 2010 to 50 km today. Observations of warming of the deep water in Nares Strait and Petermann Fjord, and of ice-shelf thinning during the decade preceding retreat, lead to a hypothesis that increased basal melting contributes to loss of the ice shelf. The project is motivated by three aspects of the Petermann Gletscher and Fjord system: (1) its importance as a gateway for GIS mass loss; (2) comparison of ocean dynamics in Petermann Fjord with previously studied southern Greenland systems; and (3) the value of PG as a well-constrained system for studying processes that contribute to mass loss from other northern Greenland and Antarctic ice-shelf systems and their contribution to rising global sea level. The project takes advantage of recent observations of this system, including ongoing satellite-relayed data from sub-ice-shelf moorings.<br/><br/>This project would contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce through support for the training of two graduate and three undergraduate students, including a student from an under-represented group in STEM fields.  The PI would continue his international collaborations with Swedish, English, and Canadian collaborators that were developed as part of the initial Petermann Gletscher study aboard I/B Oden in 2015.  Outreach to the general public would be facilitated through the PI?s website, blog, occasional media interviews, and embedding national print journalists in the field work.  <br/><br/>Time series analyses will characterize how sub-glacial waters change along the central melt channel with the tides and seasons. Description of the average state and interpretation of variations will be aided by ocean survey data properties collected in the adjacent ocean by ship between 2003 and 2015. Both time- and frequency-domain statistical analyses will reveal correlation time and space scales. More specifically, Fourier, wavelet, and Hilbert transforms will be used to provide estimates of amplitude and phase at discrete scales. Frequency-domain linear system analyses will reveal input-output relations between multiple time series that represent forcings (e.g., atmospheric temperature and wind stress when sea-ice is mobile or absent, tides) and responses (e.g., depth of surface mixed layer, heat content of the meltwater plume, ice velocity and basal melt rate). Analyses of data from GPS and pressure sensors at each mooring will determine the degree of floatation at each site as the glacier transitions from >365 m to <100 m in thickness. Summer ocean surveys describe the inflowing Atlantic waters that will become diluted by basal melt and by direct injection of freshwater. Thermodynamic constraints on the solid-to-fluid phase transition of glacier ice melted by the ocean result in a characteristic relation of ocean temperatures and salinity (the Gade-line), which is set by the latent heat of melting. A second mixing line arises from ice-shelf surface melting and direct runoff into the fjord. In some fjord systems, this component includes a substantial discharge of subglacial water generated upstream of the grounding line. The proposed temperature-salinity analyses will reveal the importance of this sub-glacial freshwater source along the central melt-channel."

One line of evidence for accelerated glacier ice loss has been an increase in the rate at which the land has been rising across the Antarctic Peninsula as measured by GPS receivers.  However, GPS observations of uplift are limited to the last two decades.  One goal of this study is to determine how these newly observed rates of uplift compare to average rates of uplift across the Antarctic Peninsula over a longer time interval. Researchers will reconstruct past sea levels using the age and elevation of ancient beaches now stranded above sea level on the low-lying coastal hills of the Antarctica Peninsula to determine the rate of uplift over the last 5,000 years.  The researchers will also analyze the structure of the beaches using ground-penetrating radar and the characteristics of beach sediments to understand how sea-level rise and past climate changes are recorded in beach deposits.  The benefits of these new records will be threefold: (1) they will help determine the natural variability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and relative sea level (2) they will provide new insight about uplift and the structure of the Earth's interior; and 3) they will help researchers refine the methods used to determine the age of geologic deposits.

The purpose of this project is to use optically stimulated luminescence to date a series of newly discovered raised beaches along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and an already known, but only preliminarily dated, series of raised beaches in the South Shetland Islands. Data to be collected at the raised beaches include the age and elevation, ground-penetrating radar profiles, and the roundness of cobbles and the lithology of ice-rafted debris. The study will test three hypotheses: (1) uplift rates have increased in modern times relative to the late Holocene across the Antarctic Peninsula, (2) the sea-level history at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is distinctly different than that of the South Shetland Islands, and (3) cobble roundness and the source of ice-rafted debris on raised beaches varied systematically through time reflecting the climate history of the northern Antarctic Peninsula."

A downward September trend has accelerated over the last decade, with the 10 lowest September sea-ice extents occurring in the last 10 years. An essentially ice-free Arctic during summer is expected by mid-century. Loss of the sea- ice cover has profound consequences for ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic, so there is an urgent need to advance sea-ice predictions in all seasons at both the pan-Arctic and regional scales. A better quantification of the role of oceanic heat and climate variations in the Pacific sector, new observational-based sea-ice products, and network activities will advance understanding of seasonal predictability of Arctic sea ice, the limits of this predictability, and the economic value of forecasts for stakeholders. The network supported by this grant will examine origins and impacts of extreme ocean surface warming in preconditioning the ice cover in the Pacific Arctic for continued major reductions in sea-ice extent and duration. <br/><br/>A key finding that emerged from the earlier Sea Ice Prediction Network (SIPN) effort is that predictions of September sea-ice extent tend to have less skill in extreme years that strongly depart from the trend line. The objective of proposed research under Phase 2 of SIPN (SIPN2) is to improve forecast skill through adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that includes modeling, new products, data analysis, scientific networks, and stakeholder engagement. This grant will: Investigate the sensitivity of subseasonal-to-seasonal sea-ice predictability in the Alaska Arctic to variations in oceanic heat and large- scale atmospheric forcing using a dynamical model Community Earth System Model (NCAR CESM) and statistical forecasting tools, focusing on spatial fields in addition to total extent summaries; Assess the accuracy of Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) submissions based on methodology and initialization; Develop new observation-based products for improving sea-ice predictions, including sea-ice thickness, surface roughness, melt ponds, and snow depth; Evaluate the socio-economic value of sea-ice forecasts to stakeholders who manage ship traffic and coastal village resupply in the Alaska Sector, and engage the public in Arctic climate and sea-ice prediction through blog exchanges, accessible SIO reports, bi-monthly webinars, and by making public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike; and Continue and evolve network activities to generate SIO forecasts and reporting for September minima as in SIPN and expand SIPN2 forecasts to include full spatial resolution and emerging ice-anomaly-months (October - November). <br/><br/>This work will directly engage stakeholders that create and use sea-ice forecasts in Alaska and lead to improved safety around sea ice. Work under SIPN2 will also track public awareness and perceptions regarding sea ice, helping to raise understanding through accessible reports, discussions, and public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike. Stakeholder engagement during the research process will potentially facilitate rapid research-to-operations implementation of the products of this work."

To mitigate and properly react to this threat, society needs accurate predictions of future sea-level variations. The largest uncertainty in these predictions comes from estimating the amount of ice that melts from polar ice sheets, especially from the West Antarctica ice sheet. Right now, scientists estimate the mass variations of ice sheets in two ways. The first way is using airplanes and repeated flybys to monitor the variation of ice sheet topography and estimate the gain or loss of ice. The second way is using satellite measurements to track gravity fluctuations that correlate with the variation of ice sheet volume. Both techniques work, but both have limitations including cost and resolution. This project uses a passive seismic monitoring method to estimate the change in weight of the ice pressing on the Earth's crust. One advantage of this seismic method is that vibrations are recorded continuously; therefore, it is possible to monitor the changes of the ice sheet with better temporal resolution. The sensitivity of the seismic waves also provides a picture of the structure of the interface between the ice and the rocks beneath the ice, where most of the dynamics and changes of the ice sheet take place. This information is difficult to obtain with other methods. In this project, the researchers will process and analyze previously acquired seismic data from the POLENET-ANET array, measuring variations in seismic wave speed through time to assess the amount of ice lost or gained. They will also determine important information about the mechanical properties at the ice-rock interface. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar to develop this new branch of seismological research and more generally the field of environmental seismology. This project will also support the education of a PhD student who will work in close collaboration with the postdoctoral scholar and the two researchers.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The researchers plan to monitor ice-mass variations in the West-Antarctic ice sheet by measuring and interpreting seismic velocity changes in crust beneath the ice sheet. This project will extend similar work already completed on the Greenland ice sheet, where ice-mass fluctuations were found to lead to poroelastic changes in the crust and modify the seismic-wave velocity. This investigation uses a passive seismology method, whereby repetitive seismic noise correlation functions are computed from records of Earth's ambient seismic noise field. Measurements of the temporal changes in the correlation functions are made and then related to variations of the poroelastic properties of the crust. The physical model for the relationship between ice-mass change and surface-wave velocity change has previously been verified using GRACE satellite data in Greenland. This project will specifically focus on the recent rapid ice loss in Western Antarctica using data from the POLENET-ANET seismic network. A comparison between the ice-sheet behaviors in Greenland and Antarctica will provide clarification about the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed seismic velocity changes. This new method will be a transformative approach to monitor ice sheets with the potential for much higher spatial and temporal resolution than existing methods. The fact that this method relies on seismic waves makes the approach completely independent from other modern ice-sheet monitoring techniques."

One line of evidence for accelerated glacier ice loss has been an increase in the rate at which the land has been rising across the Antarctic Peninsula as measured by GPS receivers.  However, GPS observations of uplift are limited to the last two decades.  One goal of this study is to determine how these newly observed rates of uplift compare to average rates of uplift across the Antarctic Peninsula over a longer time interval. Researchers will reconstruct past sea levels using the age and elevation of ancient beaches now stranded above sea level on the low-lying coastal hills of the Antarctica Peninsula to determine the rate of uplift over the last 5,000 years.  The researchers will also analyze the structure of the beaches using ground-penetrating radar and the characteristics of beach sediments to understand how sea-level rise and past climate changes are recorded in beach deposits.  The benefits of these new records will be threefold: (1) they will help determine the natural variability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and relative sea level (2) they will provide new insight about uplift and the structure of the Earth's interior; and 3) they will help researchers refine the methods used to determine the age of geologic deposits.   The study results will be shared in outreach events at K-12 schools and with visitors of the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum.  Three graduate students will be supported through this project.  <br/><br/>Technical description<br/><br/>Paleo sea-level data is critical for reconstructing the size and extent of past ice sheets, documenting increased uplift following glacial retreat, and correcting gravity-based measurements of ice-mass loss for the impacts of post-glacial rebound. However, there are only 14 sites with relative sea-level data for Antarctica compared to over 500 sites used in a recent study of the North American Ice-Sheet complex.  The purpose of this project is to use optically stimulated luminescence to date a series of newly discovered raised beaches along the eastern Antarctic Peninsula and an already known, but only preliminarily dated, series of raised beaches in the South Shetland Islands. Data to be collected at the raised beaches include the age and elevation, ground-penetrating radar profiles, and the roundness of cobbles and the lithology of ice-rafted debris. The study will test three hypotheses: (1) uplift rates have increased in modern times relative to the late Holocene across the Antarctic Peninsula, (2) the sea-level history at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is distinctly different than that of the South Shetland Islands, and (3) cobble roundness and the source of ice-rafted debris on raised beaches varied systematically through time reflecting the climate history of the northern Antarctic Peninsula."

Waesche volcano. Reconstructing WAIS geometry when the ice sheet was smaller than present is difficult and data are lacking because the evidence lies beneath the present ice sheet. This study will drill through the ice sheet and recover bedrock that can be analyzed for its surface exposure history to help determine when the surface became overridden by the ice sheet. This study will provide constraints on the past maximum and minimum spatial extent of WAIS during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Understanding the geometry of a reduced WAIS during intervals when the planet was warmer than present may provide a possible analogue for future environmental conditions given predicted temperature trends. A reduction of WAIS results in rising sea levels which threatens coastal communities across the globe. The data will help improve numerical ice sheet models to better predict WAIS response to current and future climate trends. The project supports a teacher educational workshop and the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to obtain rock samples from beneath the WAIS through shallow (<80 m) drilling at Mt. Waesche, a volcano in Marie Byrd Land, near an ice dome of WAIS (2000 m elevation). The lithologies of lava flows exposed on the flank of the volcano are well-suited for cosmogenic 3He and 36Cl as well as 40Ar/39Ar measurements which will establish eruption and exposure age. Existing 40Ar/39Ar data indicate basaltic lava flows on the volcano flank as young as 350 ka. Thus, measured cosmogenic nuclides measured in rock cores from beneath the ice surface will be indicative of relatively recent exposure during periods of reduced ice elevation, most likely, during the last interglacial. The first field season is focused on identifying appropriate locations for drilling and a ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey of the subglacial topography <100m under the blue ice area. Mapping and dating the adjacent exposed lava flows will allow tracing of lava flows of known age and composition below the ice margin that will be targeted for drilling the following year. The second field season activities include drilling 8 boreholes (two transects) through blue ice with the Winkie drill near the ice margin to 80 m depth to obtain rock cores from the sub-ice lava flows. 3He exposure ages will constrain the duration and minimum extent of past surface lowering of the WAIS in Marie Byrd Land. Deeper GPR imaging (up to 700 m) will hope to reveal additional evidence of lava/ice interactions that would independently place constraints on lower ice levels during past eruptions. Results from this study will be compared with the modeled ice elevation histories at Mt. Waesche to validate ice sheet modeling efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from this comparison will contribute to a better understanding of the Antarctic ice sheet during the most recent global warming that ended the last ice age. This period is of interest since it will help inform our understanding of Antarctic ice sheet behavior in a future climate warming.  Such data also will help inform models that attempt to simulate not only the behavior of the ice sheet during the end of the last ice age, but also its future response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Of particular interest is the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to the global warming that ended the last ice age, because it yields important clues about likely future ice-sheet behavior under a warming climate. In this project, scientists will reconstruct the thinning history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Ross Sea sector during the last glacial/interglacial transition on the headlands of the southern Royal Society Range.

Finally, this record will be compared with a beryllium- and radiocarbon-dated chronology that will be produced of adjacent independent alpine glaciers that terminated on land during the last glacial maximum and whose deposits show cross-cutting relationships with those of the ice sheet. Results from this comparison will bear on the behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the termination of the last ice age.

Melting ice from the last retreat, from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago, raised sea levels by 8 meters or more, but the extents of previous retreats are less well known.  The main goal of this project is to understand how Antarctic ice retreats: fast or slow, stepped or steady, and which parts of the ice sheet are most prone to retreat. Antarctica loses ice by two main processes: melting of the underside of floating ice shelves and calving of icebergs. Icebergs themselves are ephemeral, but they carry mineral grains and rock fragments that have been scoured from Antarctic bedrock. As the icebergs drift and melt, this 'iceberg-rafted debris' falls to the sea-bed and is steadily buried in marine sediments to form a record of iceberg activity and ice sheet retreat. The investigators will read this record of iceberg-rafted debris to find when and where Antarctic ice destabilized in the past. This information can help to predict how Antarctic ice will behave in a warming climate. <br/><br/>The study area is the Weddell Sea embayment, in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica. Principal sources of icebergs are the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea embayment, where ice streams drain about a quarter of Antarctic ice. The provenance of the iceberg-rafted debris (IRD), and the icebergs that carried it, will be found by matching the geochemical fingerprint (such as characteristic argon isotope ages) of individual mineral grains in the IRD to that of the corresponding source area. In more detail, the project will: <br/><br/>1. Define the geochemical fingerprints of the source areas of the glacially-eroded material using samples from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea.  Existing data indicates that the hinterland of the Weddell embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas, making it possible to apply geochemical provenance techniques to determine the origin of Antarctica icebergs. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till samples to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information identifies which groups of ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents), and the stratigraphy of the cores shows the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using a new method of uranium-series isotope measurements in fine grained material.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/> The behavior of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams is a critical topic for climate change and future sea level rise. The goal of this proposal is to constrain ice sheet response to changing climate in the Weddell Sea during the three most recent glacial terminations, as analogues for potential future warming. The project will also examine possible contributions to Meltwater Pulse 1A, and test the relative stability of the ice streams draining East and West Antarctica. Much of the West Antarctic ice may have melted during the Eemian (130 to 114 Ka), so it may be an analogue for predicting future ice drawdown over the coming centuries. <br/><br/>Geochemical provenance fingerprinting of glacially eroded detritus provides a novel way to reconstruct the location and relative timing of glacial retreat during these terminations in the Weddell Sea embayment. The two major objectives of the project are to: <br/><br/>1. Define the provenance source areas by characterizing Ar, U-Pb, and Nd isotopic signatures, and heavy mineral and Fe-Ti oxide compositions of detrital minerals from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea, using onshore tills and existing sediment cores from the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves. Pilot data demonstrate that detritus originating from the east and west sides of the Weddell Sea embayment can be clearly distinguished, and published data indicates that the hinterland of the embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/><br/>2.

At the same time, human development continues to encroach and intensify, primarily due to demand for natural resources, such as oil and gas. The vast and remote nature of Arctic-boreal regions typify their landscapes, environment, wildlife, and people, but their size and isolation also make it difficult to study how their ecosystems are changing. To overcome these challenges, autonomous recording networks can be used to characterize ""soundscapes"" - a collection of sounds that emanate from landscapes. Unlike traditional observing methods that are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, sound-recording networks provide a cost-effective means to both monitor and understand the response of wildlife to environmental and anthropogenic changes across vast areas. One particular challenge with this sound-measurement approach is extracting useful ecological information from the large volumes of soundscape data that are collected. This project will develop the techniques necessary to overcome this challenge.<br/><br/>The researchers' goal is to understand the influence of both environmental dynamics and increasing anthropogenic activity on the behavior and phenology of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus), waterfowl, and songbird communities in Arctic-boreal Alaska and northwestern Canada. Through co-production of knowledge with local land managers and indigenous communities, the research team will combine field observations, modeling, and analyses that include: (1) soundscape measurements, (2) camera-trap observations, (3) automated soundscape analyses, (4) analyses of camera-trap caribou observations, (5) high-resolution modeling of environmental variables, (6) statistical analyses including wildlife occupancy, diversity, and phenology modeling, and (7) a human-computation game to collect descriptions of our acoustic recordings that allows for the participation of local and Indigenous players of the game. The project will contribute understanding of how both avian communities and caribou populations are responding to spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions and increasing development of the oil and gas industry in a region where such comprehensive, large-scale research has rarely been possible. Further, at the request of various Tribal organizations, our research will provide insight into how industrial noise influences traditional practices. In addition, our research will provide baseline data on all natural sounds, including data on bird and caribou activity, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge prior to oil and gas development.

Project results will allow assessment of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's rate of change and the time frame for its accelerating contribution to global sea-level rise, which is predicted to have an amplified impact for U.S. coastlines. This research program builds on and leverages prior investments in autonomous observational infrastructure through technological advances and international partnerships. Archived open-access data from the project will facilitate a range of studies that will advance basic knowledge of the Antarctic continent and its ice sheet cover. The project will train and mentor an interdisciplinary cohort of polar scientists through field work, workshops, and a summer school leveraged by an online resource library.   <br/><br/>The POLENET-ANET autonomous GPS and seismic network will be reconfigured to acquire higher-resolution in situ data focused around the Amundsen Embayment to capture spatially varying crustal motions and Earth structure in a region where the ice sheet is rapidly changing. The pattern and scale of lateral variations in mantle temperature, viscosity, and lithospheric elastic thickness at the resolution necessary to characterize this system will be established from seismological studies incorporating the new instrumentation footprint.  Absolute mantle viscosity values will be independently determined using crustal motion data from high-precision GPS time series together with West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) surface mass balance and ice history information.  Where mantle viscosity varies over short spatial scales and bedrock topography below the ice sheet is complex, as is hypothesized for West Antarctica, both positive and negative feedbacks between the ice sheet and the solid earth may occur, acting to stabilize or destabilize ice dynamics by raising or lowering the grounding line and reducing or increasing retrograde bed slopes below major outlet glaciers. New constraints on 3-D Earth structure will be built into innovative 3-D glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models and coupled models of climate-cryosphere-solid Earth systems.  These advanced models, constrained by the new observations obtained in this project, will simulate the past and future evolution of the WAIS to improve estimates of changing ice mass in West Antarctica, establish where the WAIS may be stabilized by ongoing Earth deformation, and reduce uncertainties in projections of future sea level change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is also the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, and thus its deposits and landforms contain unique records of past climate not accessible elsewhere in the Antarctic continent or the world. In order to accurately interpret any geologic feature, however, we must understand how it forms and changes through time. In particular, in the Dry Valleys, we have a poor understanding of the rates and causes of one of Earth's most fundamental geologic phenomenon - physical rock breakdown. For example, the Dry Valleys lack moisture, which is thought to play a key role in rock breakdown in most other locations on the planet. What serves to fracture rocks in this seemingly inert environment? This project aims to answer that question by 'listening' as rocks crack in the Dry Valleys. We will instrument boulders with sensors that act as miniature seismographs, recording even the smallest microcracking on and within the rocks. At the same time, we will monitor the weather and environment around the rocks to record the conditions that trigger cracking events. While we collect these data, we will gather rock samples from deposits of different ages (from thousands to millions of years old) in the Dry Valleys. Measurements on these samples will allow us to see how quickly rocks breakdown and how their characteristics change over geologic time. The combined datasets will allow future scientists to more accurately understand the paleoclimates and landscapes of Antarctica, and possibly even Mars.  This project will also serve to support two female investigators in a field where women are still largely underrepresented. The project will also provide unique exposure and experience to students, ranging from elementary students to the undergraduate and graduate students who will be working directly on various aspects of the project. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys experience some of the lowest erosion rates on Earth. However, our current understanding of the relative role that different weathering factors (moisture, freezing temperatures, thermal cycling, salt crystallization or hydration, and wind abrasion) play in these and other environments is limited. Further, in the Dry Valleys, there has been no systematic evaluation of the variance in weathering and associated rock erosion rates, which may change significantly as a function of subaerial exposure duration, lithology, and texture. This research seeks to (1) characterize the primary drivers of rock breakdown, (2) better quantify erosion rates, and (3) determine the lithological and environmental factors that influence weathering and erosion in the Dry Valleys. Rock breakdown (cracking) will be recorded in real-time on in situ boulders using a custom acoustic emission monitoring system. By coupling acoustic emission data with micrometeorological measurements at and near rock surfaces, this study will directly test hypotheses relating to the environmental drivers of rock breakdown under this unique polar desert climate over short (minute to monthly) timescales. Cosmogenic nuclide techniques including a novel combination of 6 isotopes (Be-10, Al-26, He-3, Ne-21, Cl-36, C-14) together with rock property measurements (e.g., strength, elastic moduli, thermal properties) will be used to elucidate the complex relationship between long-term (kyr to Myr) boulder erosion rates, lithology, rock properties, and subaerial exposure duration. By synthesizing these measurements with short-term cracking data from the acoustic emission system, the proposed work will thoroughly examine which lithological and environmental factors and grain-scale processes are driving geomorphic evolution in the Dry Valleys. By constraining boulder erosion rates and determining their sensitivity to rock properties and age, the results will be directly applicable to cosmogenic nuclide exposure age studies in this region. Additionally, the resulting information on weathering processes and their relationship to rock morphology in the Dry Valleys can be used to address hypotheses as to formation of similar rock morphologies on Mars. The Project Investigators will participate in an elementary school outreach program run by Gonzaga University, and the project will support an undergraduate and graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An isotope of the element beryllium, 10Be, is produced in the atmosphere by high-energy protons (cosmic rays) that enter Earth's atmosphere from space.  It is removed from the atmosphere by settling or by scavenging by rain or snowfall.  Hence, concentrations of 10Be in snow at the South Pole reflect the production rate of 10Be in the atmosphere.  Because the rate of production of 10Be over Antarctica depends primarily on the strength of the Sun's magnetic field, measurements of 10Be in the South Pole ice core will provide a record of changes in solar activity.  The South Pole ice core will reach an age of 40,000 years at the bottom.  The project will result in measurements of 10Be at annual resolution for the last 100 years and selected periods in the more distant past, such as the Maunder Minimum, a period during the late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed, or the last glacial cold period, about 20,000 years ago.  A climate model that can simulate the production of 10Be in the atmosphere, it's transport through the atmosphere, and its deposition at the snow surface in Antarctica will be used to aid in using the 10Be data to determine past changes in solar activity from decadal to millennial scale, and in turn to evaluate the role of the Sun in Earth?s climate from a new perspective.<br/><br/>The production of 10Be in Earth's atmosphere results from the spallation of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere by cosmic rays.  Cosmic ray variations in the high latitudes are primarily modulated by solar variability. Time-series records of 10Be from ice cores are therefore important for deriving variations in solar activity through time, which is fundamental to understanding climate variability. Deposition of 10Be to the ice surface is also influenced by variability in atmospheric circulation and deposition processes, and South Pole is the best available location for minimizing the influence of variable atmospheric circulation on 10Be deposition. To date, only one record of 10Be exists from South Pole; that record is widely used in solar forcing estimates used in climate models, but covers only the last millennium and ends in CE 1982.  We will obtain 10Be concentration measurements in a 1500-m, 40000-year long ice core from the South Pole.  This will extend the existing record both further back in time and forward to the present, providing overlap with the modern instrumental record of solar and climate variability. High resolution (annual to biannual) measurements will be made in targeted areas of interest, including the last 100 years, the Maunder Minimum (CE 1650-1715), and the last glacial maximum. The novel data will be used in conjunction with climate model experiments that incorporate 10Be production, transport, and deposition physics. Together, data and modeling will create an updated record of atmospheric 10Be production and hence of solar activity."

This is important because stability of the stratification of the ocean determines its circulation, heat transport and formation of deep water, which in turn affect the local and regional climate system, as well as ocean/atmosphere/climate interaction in lower latitudes. Thus understanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of lower salinity water (called 'freshwater') is of fundamental importance for understanding future states of the Arctic Ocean. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the region of the ocean north of Greenland, where water and sea ice ultimately take one of two pathways south. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. The project is especially interested in the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. For this purpose data collected as part of the Arctic Observing Network will be compared to model simulations and vice versa to test hypotheses concerning the circulation, accumulation and release of freshwater and its components in the Arctic Ocean and to test the performance of an Arctic Ocean model. This project will create data products for researchers and educators interested in the Arctic and its response to climate change. Circulation patterns of the individual freshwater components and other synthesized outputs, along with information and documentation needed to assist educators, will be made publicly available through an online site that is expected to have significant traffic from educators in academia and secondary school levels. This project will provide the core of a PhD dissertation for a graduate student. <br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Understanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of freshwater is of fundamental importance for examining possible future scenarios of the freshwater lens covering the Arctic Ocean, the role of freshwater in internal circulation within the Arctic, and the role of freshwater in deep water formation in the convective regions of the Nordic seas and the North Atlantic. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the Switchyard (SY) region in the context of an Arctic Ocean-wide analysis of freshwater component sources and pathways. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. There will be special emphasis on the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. <br/><br/>Recent long-term observations conducted in the Switchyard (SY) region as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) program, have revealed detailed information on both the total freshwater balance, and the components contributing to it: Pacific Water (PW), Meteoric Water (MW: River Runoff and P-E), and Sea Ice Meltwater (SIMW). The SY observations along a section between Alert and the North Pole show rapid changes in the contributions of individual freshwater components to the total inventory along with gradual changes in the total freshwater content. From backtracking the surface circulation in time based on sea ice drift patterns, the group infers that the rapid changes in the freshwater components are probably due to shifts in the sea ice and surface water source regions and pathways on time scales as short as one year, the frequency of their observations. <br/><br/>This project will combine the SY freshwater component data with those from previous (icebreaker) expeditions to characterize the main features of their distributions. In a second step, the team will extend the sea ice tracking method developed by Maslanik and Fowler to include Ekman transport in the surface ocean and will download GCM runs that simulate individual FW components. They will track the observed freshwater components back to their source regions, and forward to their exit points from the Arctic, and will identify mechanisms impacting the freshwater component circulation, especially in the SY region where they have an 8-year time series. The principal intellectual contributions will come from integrating observed freshwater component inventories and pathways with those obtained from model simulations, inferring the dynamics governing the freshwater component distributions and their adjustment as functions of source terms and atmospheric forcing."

Through investigations of Inuit foodways at the former Moravian mission of Lichtenau (1774-1974, now Alluitsoq), this project moves archaeological and anthropological studies in southernmost Greenland in a new direction by focusing on the emergence of new ethnic identities (i.e., ethnogenesis) and the sociopolitical dimensions of food during the colonial era. This project will integrate analysis of artifacts, animal bones, fat residue from foods, historic records, and local resident participation to better understand these interactions. The project was designed and will be carried out in conjunction with local Greenlandic communities, the Greenland National Museum and Archives, the University of Greenland, the University of Stirling (Scotland), and the Danish National Museum. Further, project data will be made available to other researchers working in diverse fields ranging from ancient DNA studies to environmental restoration and have applicability to Inuit societies across North America. Finally, the Alluitsoq project builds local capacity to mitigate loss of coastal heritage and takes part in world-wide efforts to save coastal archaeological sites in the Arctic, with implications for Alaskan coastal communities. <br/><br/>Advanced, well-established archaeological and ethnographic methods are integrated with the theoretical perspective of Historical Ecology to answer two research questions: 1) Do foodways exhibit statistically significant changes during the late 18th to early 20th century occupation of Alluitsoq; and 2) are foodways used to generate and perform an emergent ethnic and national Inuit identity in Colonial Greenland's Reconstructing past foodway change and persistence is achieved through an analysis of durable faunal remains that considers represented species, minimum numbers of individuals of different taxa, and processing evidence. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of lipids preserved on artifacts and in sediment deposits reveals the contribution of non-durable or completely consumed foods (e.g., dried peas or wheat flour) to the diet of Alluitsoq residents. Ethnohistoric data from descendant interviews and historic documents build an interpretive framework to assess whether the observed foodway patterns are the result of reconfigured Inuit ethnic identities. To articulate these ethnohistoric data with archaeological results, the researchers use the methods of Grounded Theory to code interviews and documents, identify conceptual categories, and assess the salience of ethnic taxa to the historic and present-day Greenlandic community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The geologic record of Earth's past offers a glimpse of what could be in store for the future.  Research by Ivany and her team looks to Antarctica during a time of past global warmth to see how seasonality of temperature and rainfall in coastal settings are likely to change in the future.  They will use the chemistry of fossils (a natural archive of these variables) to test a provocative hypothesis about near-monsoonal conditions in the high latitudes when the oceans are warm.  If true, we can expect high-latitude shipping lanes to become more hazardous and fragile marine ecosystems adapted to constant cold temperatures to suffer.  With growing information about how human activities are likely to affect the planet in the future, we will be able to make more informed decisions about policies today. This research involves an international team of scholars, including several women scientists, training of graduate students, and a public museum exhibit to educate children about how we study Earth's ancient climate and what we can learn from it.<br/><br/>Antarctica is key to an understanding how Earth?s climate system works under conditions of elevated CO2. The poles are the most sensitive regions on the planet to climate change, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and the degree to which high-latitude warming is amplified are important components for climate models to capture. Accurate proxy data with good age control are therefore critical for testing numerical models and establishing global patterns. The La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island is the only documented marine section from the globally warm Eocene Epoch exposed in outcrop on the continent; hence its climate record is integral to studies of warming. Early data suggest the potential for strongly seasonal precipitation and runoff in coastal settings.  This collaboration among paleontologists, geochemists, and climate modelers will test this using seasonally resolved del-18O data from fossil shallow marine bivalves to track the evolution of seasonality through the section, in combination with independent proxies for the composition of summer precipitation (leaf wax del-D) and local seawater (clumped isotopes).  The impact of the anticipated salinity stratification on regional climate will be evaluated in the context of numerical climate model simulations.  In addition to providing greater clarity on high-latitude conditions during this time of high CO2, the combination of proxy and model results will provide insights about how Eocene warmth may have been maintained and how subsequent cooling came about. As well, a new approach to the analysis of shell carbonates for 87Sr/86Sr will allow refinements in age control so as to allow correlation of this important section with other regions to clarify global climate gradients.  The project outlined here will develop new and detailed paleoclimate records from existing samples using well-tuned as well as newer proxies applied here in novel ways. Seasonal extremes are climate parameters generally inaccessible to most studies but critical to an understanding of climate change; these are possible to resolve in this well-preserved, accretionary-macrofossil-bearing section. This is an integrated study that links marine and terrestrial climate records for a key region of the planet across the most significant climate transition in the Cenozoic."

This research (1) improves the spatial coverage and accuracy of measurements of surface uplift using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and (2) probes the structure of the deep earth using seismology. These observations will be integrated into a state-of-the-art, 3-D ice sheet model to simulate the past and future behavior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and assess its vulnerability. Project results will allow assessment of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's rate of change and the time frame for its accelerating contribution to global sea-level rise, which is predicted to have an amplified impact for U.S. coastlines. This research program builds on and leverages prior investments in autonomous observational infrastructure through technological advances and international partnerships. Archived open-access data from the project will facilitate a range of studies that will advance basic knowledge of the Antarctic continent and its ice sheet cover. The project will train and mentor an interdisciplinary cohort of polar scientists through field work, workshops, and a summer school leveraged by an online resource library.   <br/><br/>The POLENET-ANET autonomous GPS and seismic network will be reconfigured to acquire higher-resolution in situ data focused around the Amundsen Embayment to capture spatially varying crustal motions and Earth structure in a region where the ice sheet is rapidly changing. The pattern and scale of lateral variations in mantle temperature, viscosity, and lithospheric elastic thickness at the resolution necessary to characterize this system will be established from seismological studies incorporating the new instrumentation footprint.  Absolute mantle viscosity values will be independently determined using crustal motion data from high-precision GPS time series together with West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) surface mass balance and ice history information.  Where mantle viscosity varies over short spatial scales and bedrock topography below the ice sheet is complex, as is hypothesized for West Antarctica, both positive and negative feedbacks between the ice sheet and the solid earth may occur, acting to stabilize or destabilize ice dynamics by raising or lowering the grounding line and reducing or increasing retrograde bed slopes below major outlet glaciers. New constraints on 3-D Earth structure will be built into innovative 3-D glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models and coupled models of climate-cryosphere-solid Earth systems.  These advanced models, constrained by the new observations obtained in this project, will simulate the past and future evolution of the WAIS to improve estimates of changing ice mass in West Antarctica, establish where the WAIS may be stabilized by ongoing Earth deformation, and reduce uncertainties in projections of future sea level change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Melting ice from the last retreat, from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago, raised sea levels by 8 meters or more, but the extents of previous retreats are less well known.  The main goal of this project is to understand how Antarctic ice retreats: fast or slow, stepped or steady, and which parts of the ice sheet are most prone to retreat. Antarctica loses ice by two main processes: melting of the underside of floating ice shelves and calving of icebergs. Icebergs themselves are ephemeral, but they carry mineral grains and rock fragments that have been scoured from Antarctic bedrock. As the icebergs drift and melt, this ?iceberg-rafted debris? falls to the sea-bed and is steadily buried in marine sediments to form a record of iceberg activity and ice sheet retreat. The investigators will read this record of iceberg-rafted debris to find when and where Antarctic ice destabilized in the past. This information can help to predict how Antarctic ice will behave in a warming climate. <br/>The study area is the Weddell Sea embayment, in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica. Principal sources of icebergs are the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea embayment, where ice streams drain about a quarter of Antarctic ice. The provenance of the iceberg-rafted debris (IRD), and the icebergs that carried it, will be found by matching the geochemical fingerprint (such as characteristic argon isotope ages) of individual mineral grains in the IRD to that of the corresponding source area. In more detail, the project will: <br/>1. Define the geochemical fingerprints of the source areas of the glacially-eroded material using samples from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea.  Existing data indicates that the hinterland of the Weddell embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas, making it possible to apply geochemical provenance techniques to determine the origin of Antarctica icebergs. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information identifies which groups of ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents), and the stratigraphy of the cores shows the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using a new method of uranium-series isotope measurements in fine grained material.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/> The behavior of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams is a critical topic for climate change and future sea level rise. The goal of this proposal is to constrain ice sheet response to changing climate in the Weddell Sea during the three most recent glacial terminations, as analogues for potential future warming. The project will also examine possible contributions to Meltwater Pulse 1A, and test the relative stability of the ice streams draining East and West Antarctica. Much of the West Antarctic ice may have melted during the Eemian (130 to 114 Ka), so it may be an analogue for predicting future ice drawdown over the coming centuries. <br/>Geochemical provenance fingerprinting of glacially eroded detritus provides a novel way to reconstruct the location and relative timing of glacial retreat during these terminations in the Weddell Sea embayment. The two major objectives of the project are to: <br/>1. Define the provenance source areas by characterizing Ar, U-Pb, and Nd isotopic signatures, and heavy mineral and Fe-Ti oxide compositions of detrital minerals from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea, using onshore tills and existing sediment cores from the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves. Pilot data demonstrate that detritus originating from the east and west sides of the Weddell Sea embayment can be clearly distinguished, and published data indicates that the hinterland of the embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/>2.

The melting of glaciers in mountain areas worldwide in response to global warming is a major cause of sea level rise and increases in nuisance coastal flooding. However, the world's largest land-based ice sheets are situated in the Polar Regions and their response under continued warming is very difficult to predict. One reason for this uncertainty is a lack of observations of ice behavior and melt under conditions of warming, as it is a relatively new global climate state lasting only a few generations so far. Researchers will investigate ice growth on Antarctica under past warm conditions using geological archives embedded in the layers of sand and mud under the sea floor near Antarctica. By peeling back at the layers beneath the seafloor investigators can read the history book of past events affecting the ice sheet. The Antarctic continent on the South Pole, carries the largest ice mass in the world. The investigator's findings will substantially improve scientists understanding of the response of ice sheets to global warming and its effect on sea level rise.<br/><br/><br/>Abstract (technical)<br/>The melt of land based ice is raising global sea levels with at present only minor contributions from polar ice sheets. However, the future role of polar ice sheets in climate change is one of the most critical uncertainties in predictions of sea level rise around the globe. The respective roles of oceanic and atmospheric greenhouse forcing on ice sheets are poorly addressed with recent measurements of polar climatology, because of the extreme rise in greenhouse forcing the earth is experiencing at this time. Data on the evolution of the West Antarctic ice sheet is particularly sparse. To address the data gap, researchers will reconstruct the timing and spatial distribution of Antarctic ice growth through the last greenhouse to icehouse climate transition around 37 to 33 Ma. They will collect sedimentological and geochemical data on core samples from a high-latitude paleoarchive to trace the shutdown of the chemical weathering system, the onset of glacial erosion, ice rafting, and sea ice development, as East and West Antarctic ice sheets coalesced in the Weddell Sea sector. Their findings will lead to profound increases in the understanding of the role of greenhouse forcing in ice sheet development and its effect on the global climate system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An isotope of the element beryllium, 10Be, is produced in the atmosphere by high-energy protons (cosmic rays) that enter Earth's atmosphere from space.  It is removed from the atmosphere by settling or by scavenging by rain or snowfall.  Hence, concentrations of 10Be in snow at the South Pole reflect the production rate of 10Be in the atmosphere.  Because the rate of production of 10Be over Antarctica depends primarily on the strength of the Sun's magnetic field, measurements of 10Be in the South Pole ice core will provide a record of changes in solar activity.  The South Pole ice core will reach an age of 40,000 years at the bottom.  The project will result in measurements of 10Be at annual resolution for the last 100 years and selected periods in the more distant past, such as the Maunder Minimum, a period during the late 17th century during which no sunspots were observed, or the last glacial cold period, about 20,000 years ago.  A climate model that can simulate the production of 10Be in the atmosphere, it's transport through the atmosphere, and its deposition at the snow surface in Antarctica will be used to aid in using the 10Be data to determine past changes in solar activity from decadal to millennial scale, and in turn to evaluate the role of the Sun in Earth?s climate from a new perspective.<br/><br/>The production of 10Be in Earth's atmosphere results from the spallation of oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere by cosmic rays.  Cosmic ray variations in the high latitudes are primarily modulated by solar variability. Time-series records of 10Be from ice cores are therefore important for deriving variations in solar activity through time, which is fundamental to understanding climate variability. Deposition of 10Be to the ice surface is also influenced by variability in atmospheric circulation and deposition processes, and South Pole is the best available location for minimizing the influence of variable atmospheric circulation on 10Be deposition. To date, only one record of 10Be exists from South Pole; that record is widely used in solar forcing estimates used in climate models, but covers only the last millennium and ends in CE 1982.  We will obtain 10Be concentration measurements in a 1500-m, 40000-year long ice core from the South Pole.  This will extend the existing record both further back in time and forward to the present, providing overlap with the modern instrumental record of solar and climate variability. High resolution (annual to biannual) measurements will be made in targeted areas of interest, including the last 100 years, the Maunder Minimum (CE 1650-1715), and the last glacial maximum. The novel data will be used in conjunction with climate model experiments that incorporate 10Be production, transport, and deposition physics. Together, data and modeling will create an updated record of atmospheric 10Be production and hence of solar activity."

The network supported by this grant will examine origins and impacts of extreme ocean surface warming in preconditioning the ice cover in the Pacific Arctic for continued major reductions in sea-ice extent and duration. <br/><br/>A key finding that emerged from the earlier Sea Ice Prediction Network (SIPN) effort is that predictions of September sea-ice extent tend to have less skill in extreme years that strongly depart from the trend line. The objective of proposed research under Phase 2 of SIPN (SIPN2) is to improve forecast skill through adopting a multi-disciplinary approach that includes modeling, new products, data analysis, scientific networks, and stakeholder engagement. This grant will: Investigate the sensitivity of subseasonal-to-seasonal sea-ice predictability in the Alaska Arctic to variations in oceanic heat and large- scale atmospheric forcing using a dynamical model Community Earth System Model (NCAR CESM) and statistical forecasting tools, focusing on spatial fields in addition to total extent summaries; Assess the accuracy of Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) submissions based on methodology and initialization; Develop new observation-based products for improving sea-ice predictions, including sea-ice thickness, surface roughness, melt ponds, and snow depth; Evaluate the socio-economic value of sea-ice forecasts to stakeholders who manage ship traffic and coastal village resupply in the Alaska Sector, and engage the public in Arctic climate and sea-ice prediction through blog exchanges, accessible SIO reports, bi-monthly webinars, and by making public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike; and Continue and evolve network activities to generate SIO forecasts and reporting for September minima as in SIPN and expand SIPN2 forecasts to include full spatial resolution and emerging ice-anomaly-months (October - November). <br/><br/>This work will directly engage stakeholders that create and use sea-ice forecasts in Alaska and lead to improved safety around sea ice. Work under SIPN2 will also track public awareness and perceptions regarding sea ice, helping to raise understanding through accessible reports, discussions, and public data sources useful to non-scientists and scientists alike. Stakeholder engagement during the research process will potentially facilitate rapid research-to-operations implementation of the products of this work."

The rate and pattern of glacier retreat in these circumstances is thought to be controlled by the terrain under the ice. This project incorporates evidence of past ice-retreat events and other field data, such as grounding-line positions and dates, subglacial topography, and meltwater features, into numerical models of ice flow to investigate the influence that grounding-line processes and subglacial topography have on glacier retreat rates over the past 15,000 years.<br/><br/>Recent observations suggest that Antarctic ice mass loss is largely driven by perturbations at or near the grounding line. However, the lack of information on subglacial and grounding-line environments causes large uncertainties in projections of mass loss and sea-level rise. This project will integrate geologic data from the deglaciated continental shelf into numerical models of varying complexity from one to three-dimensions. Rarely do numerical ice-sheet models of Antarctica have multiple constraints on dynamics over the past ~15,000 years (a period that spans the deglaciation of the Antarctic continental shelf since the Last Glacial Maximum).  The geologic constraints include grounding-line positions, deglacial chronologies, and information on grounding line-ice shelf processes.   The models will be used to investigate necessary perturbations and controls that meet the geological constraints. The multidisciplinary approach of merging geologic reconstructions of paleo-ice behavior with numerical models of ice response will allow the research team to test understanding of subglacial controls on grounding-line dynamics and assess the stability of modern grounding lines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interviews with Yup'ik residents of Quinhagak will focus on how Yup'ik communities defined gender in the past, and how gendered identities may be visible archaeologically in the artifacts and built spaces of Nunalleq. Using community knowledge as the cornerstone for archaeological interpretations ensures that Yup'ik perspectives are honored in the research process and that gendered social identities are considered in a complex and contextual manner. As a community-based project, this research is part of a larger disciplinary movement towards Indigenous community involvement in the planning and implementation of archaeological projects and the interpretation and analysis of resultant data. The benefits of such approaches are myriad: not only does community-based research attend to the specific needs and conditions of Indigenous communities (many of whom are marginalized), but such strategies often result in more robust and publically-relevant research questions and analysis. Together, the Nunalleq site and the neighboring community of Quinhagak provide a unique opportunity for community-based research on gender. Located just a few miles outside of Quinhagak, Nunalleq has long been a fixture in local histories, and its links to the 13th-17th century Bow and Arrow wars connect it to a broader regional heritage that has been little explored. Nunalleq has been subject to remarkable permafrost preservation, with artifacts of unusual quality being recovered in very high numbers. The confluence of having high-quality archaeological data alongside a community with knowledge of and interest in the site creates an ideal setting for community-based research on gender and social identities, themes that are best explored with robust archaeological and oral historical data. That themes of gender and social identity have received little attention in regional archaeological studies further suggests the importance of this study, as does Nunalleq's status as an archaeological resource increasingly threatened by environmental change."

Melting ice from the last retreat, from 19,000 to 9,000 years ago, raised sea levels by 8 meters or more, but the extents of previous retreats are less well known.  The main goal of this project is to understand how Antarctic ice retreats: fast or slow, stepped or steady, and which parts of the ice sheet are most prone to retreat. Antarctica loses ice by two main processes: melting of the underside of floating ice shelves and calving of icebergs. Icebergs themselves are ephemeral, but they carry mineral grains and rock fragments that have been scoured from Antarctic bedrock. As the icebergs drift and melt, this ?iceberg-rafted debris? falls to the sea-bed and is steadily buried in marine sediments to form a record of iceberg activity and ice sheet retreat. The investigators will read this record of iceberg-rafted debris to find when and where Antarctic ice destabilized in the past. This information can help to predict how Antarctic ice will behave in a warming climate. <br/>The study area is the Weddell Sea embayment, in the Atlantic sector of Antarctica. Principal sources of icebergs are the nearby Antarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea embayment, where ice streams drain about a quarter of Antarctic ice. The provenance of the iceberg-rafted debris (IRD), and the icebergs that carried it, will be found by matching the geochemical fingerprint (such as characteristic argon isotope ages) of individual mineral grains in the IRD to that of the corresponding source area. In more detail, the project will: <br/>1. Define the geochemical fingerprints of the source areas of the glacially-eroded material using samples from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea.  Existing data indicates that the hinterland of the Weddell embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas, making it possible to apply geochemical provenance techniques to determine the origin of Antarctica icebergs. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/>2. Document the stratigraphic changes in provenance of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) and glacially-eroded material in two deep water sediment cores in the NW Weddell Sea. Icebergs calved from ice streams in the embayment are carried by the Weddell Gyre and deposit IRD as they pass over the core sites. The provenance information identifies which groups of ice streams were actively eroding and exporting detritus to the ocean (via iceberg rafting and bottom currents), and the stratigraphy of the cores shows the relative sequence of ice stream activity through time. A further dimension is added by determining the time lag between fine sediment erosion and deposition, using a new method of uranium-series isotope measurements in fine grained material.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/> The behavior of the Antarctic ice sheets and ice streams is a critical topic for climate change and future sea level rise. The goal of this proposal is to constrain ice sheet response to changing climate in the Weddell Sea during the three most recent glacial terminations, as analogues for potential future warming. The project will also examine possible contributions to Meltwater Pulse 1A, and test the relative stability of the ice streams draining East and West Antarctica. Much of the West Antarctic ice may have melted during the Eemian (130 to 114 Ka), so it may be an analogue for predicting future ice drawdown over the coming centuries. <br/>Geochemical provenance fingerprinting of glacially eroded detritus provides a novel way to reconstruct the location and relative timing of glacial retreat during these terminations in the Weddell Sea embayment. The two major objectives of the project are to: <br/>1. Define the provenance source areas by characterizing Ar, U-Pb, and Nd isotopic signatures, and heavy mineral and Fe-Ti oxide compositions of detrital minerals from each major ice stream entering the Weddell Sea, using onshore tills and existing sediment cores from the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves. Pilot data demonstrate that detritus originating from the east and west sides of the Weddell Sea embayment can be clearly distinguished, and published data indicates that the hinterland of the embayment is made up of geochemically distinguishable source areas. Few samples of onshore tills are available from this area, so this project includes fieldwork to collect till to characterize detritus supplied by the Recovery and Foundation ice streams. <br/>2.

To mitigate and properly react to this threat, society needs accurate predictions of future sea-level variations. The largest uncertainty in these predictions comes from estimating the amount of ice that melts from polar ice sheets, especially from the West Antarctica ice sheet. Right now, scientists estimate the mass variations of ice sheets in two ways. The first way is using airplanes and repeated flybys to monitor the variation of ice sheet topography and estimate the gain or loss of ice. The second way is using satellite measurements to track gravity fluctuations that correlate with the variation of ice sheet volume. Both techniques work, but both have limitations including cost and resolution. This project uses a passive seismic monitoring method to estimate the change in weight of the ice pressing on the Earth's crust. One advantage of this seismic method is that vibrations are recorded continuously; therefore, it is possible to monitor the changes of the ice sheet with better temporal resolution. The sensitivity of the seismic waves also provides a picture of the structure of the interface between the ice and the rocks beneath the ice, where most of the dynamics and changes of the ice sheet take place. This information is difficult to obtain with other methods. In this project, the researchers will process and analyze previously acquired seismic data from the POLENET-ANET array, measuring variations in seismic wave speed through time to assess the amount of ice lost or gained. They will also determine important information about the mechanical properties at the ice-rock interface. The project will support a postdoctoral scholar to develop this new branch of seismological research and more generally the field of environmental seismology. This project will also support the education of a PhD student who will work in close collaboration with the postdoctoral scholar and the two researchers.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The researchers plan to monitor ice-mass variations in the West-Antarctic ice sheet by measuring and interpreting seismic velocity changes in crust beneath the ice sheet. This project will extend similar work already completed on the Greenland ice sheet, where ice-mass fluctuations were found to lead to poroelastic changes in the crust and modify the seismic-wave velocity. This investigation uses a passive seismology method, whereby repetitive seismic noise correlation functions are computed from records of Earth's ambient seismic noise field. Measurements of the temporal changes in the correlation functions are made and then related to variations of the poroelastic properties of the crust. The physical model for the relationship between ice-mass change and surface-wave velocity change has previously been verified using GRACE satellite data in Greenland. This project will specifically focus on the recent rapid ice loss in Western Antarctica using data from the POLENET-ANET seismic network. A comparison between the ice-sheet behaviors in Greenland and Antarctica will provide clarification about the underlying physical processes responsible for the observed seismic velocity changes. This new method will be a transformative approach to monitor ice sheets with the potential for much higher spatial and temporal resolution than existing methods. The fact that this method relies on seismic waves makes the approach completely independent from other modern ice-sheet monitoring techniques."

Field studies have documented rapid population growth under favorable environmental conditions, resulting in dense blooms of salps that substantially change the pelagic ecosystem in regards to both structure and processes.  Because this zooplankton can proliferate rapidly and it is not readily consumed by upper trophic levels, its periodic dominance has the potential to drastically chance ecosystem energetics as well as change material export to the deep ocean.  Completion of a comprehensive reference genome for the Antarctic salp will enable the identification of genes and gene networks underlying physiological responses and allow detection of potential processes driving natural selection and the species? adaptation strategies to the Antarctic Environment.  Comparative genomic analysis will add the dimension of time to inferences about organismal adaptation and allow consideration of their potential to adapt to future environmental changes, and will allow examination of novel aspects of genomic evolution found only in the invertebrate class Tunicata. The completed salp reference genome will provide a valuable foundational resource for other scientists working on this species as well as the genomic basis for function and adaptation in the Antarctic. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The primary goal of this effort is to examine the rapid genome evolution characteristic of this tunicate species and examine the genomic bases of the species? potential for adaptation, and specifically the role of flexible gene networks for successful responses to changing environmental conditions. The primary hypothesis driving this research is that predicted S. thompsoni orthologs (i.e., genes of the same function that share a common ancestor) that show evidence of rapid evolution are indicative of positive selection, and further that these genes and associated gene networks provide the basis for rapid adaptation of the Antarctic salp to environmental variation associated with a changing ocean. The proposed genome assembly strategy will allow further refinements and scaffolding of the current, highly fragmented genome assembly using the methods developed during previous work. Specimens of S. thompsoni now archived at UConn will be analyzed to improve the salp genome assembly, increasing overall scaffold length, and decreasing the number of total contigs.  High-quality reference assemblies will be obtained with two high-output paired-end sequencing runs (Illumina) on a single individual, coupled with three runs on the Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencer. The same sequencing strategy will be performed on a sub-sampling of tissues from the same specimen to produce a very high quality reference transcriptome, which will allow for high quality gene models and near-complete gene predictions in the genome assembly. Comparisons with available genomic data for Urochordate and Cephalochordate species will increase the number of orthologs analyzed. Orthologous genes will be tested for evidence of rapid selection in the salp lineage, and the results will be compared to published expression profiles and ontology functions for the salp. All data will be made publicly available via existing web portals; a project website will be developed to disseminate research results for access by the both research and educational communities. Website design will use a local instance of jbrowse that will offer annotations, downloadable data files, and tracts of previously-published datasets."

At the same time, human development continues to encroach and intensify, primarily due to demand for natural resources, such as oil and gas. The vast and remote nature of Arctic-boreal regions typify their landscapes, environment, wildlife, and people, but their size and isolation also make it difficult to study how their ecosystems are changing. To overcome these challenges, autonomous recording networks can be used to characterize ""soundscapes"" - a collection of sounds that emanate from landscapes. Unlike traditional observing methods that are expensive, labor-intensive, and logistically challenging, sound-recording networks provide a cost-effective means to both monitor and understand the response of wildlife to environmental and anthropogenic changes across vast areas. One particular challenge with this sound-measurement approach is extracting useful ecological information from the large volumes of soundscape data that are collected. This project will develop the techniques necessary to overcome this challenge.<br/><br/>The researchers' goal is to understand the influence of both environmental dynamics and increasing anthropogenic activity on the behavior and phenology of migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus), waterfowl, and songbird communities in Arctic-boreal Alaska and northwestern Canada. Through co-production of knowledge with local land managers and indigenous communities, the research team will combine field observations, modeling, and analyses that include: (1) soundscape measurements, (2) camera-trap observations, (3) automated soundscape analyses, (4) analyses of camera-trap caribou observations, (5) high-resolution modeling of environmental variables, (6) statistical analyses including wildlife occupancy, diversity, and phenology modeling, and (7) a human-computation game to collect descriptions of our acoustic recordings that allows for the participation of local and Indigenous players of the game. The project will contribute understanding of how both avian communities and caribou populations are responding to spatiotemporal variations in environmental conditions and increasing development of the oil and gas industry in a region where such comprehensive, large-scale research has rarely been possible. Further, at the request of various Tribal organizations, our research will provide insight into how industrial noise influences traditional practices. In addition, our research will provide baseline data on all natural sounds, including data on bird and caribou activity, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge prior to oil and gas development.

Satellite remote-sensing, regional climate modeling and nonlinear analysis techniques will be used to: assess variability of observed surface melt occurrence; benchmark model-based melt proxies versus observed melt; diagnose synoptic-scale meteorological/sea-ice controls on melt; and assess future change in melt proxies based on regional models driven by CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) general circulation models (GCMs). Understanding surface melt on polar ice sheets is important because surface melt affects albedo, can produce useful paleoclimatic records, contributes to mass balance through runoff, and is a trigger for ice-shelf collapse leading to ice-flow acceleration and sea-level rise. Improved understanding of the synoptic-meteorological causes of melting, and of the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate melting accurately, would help assess the effects of future warming on melting, ice-sheet flow and sea level rise. The investigators propose three main research themes to help address these issues: (1) regional-atmospheric-model skill assessments and diagnosis of present synoptic controls on surface melt; (2) application of results from the model skill assessments to GCM-based climate scenarios for estimates of future change; and (3) expanding satellite-based retrieval of surface melt state characterization through retrieval of melt magnitude using a novel fusion of passive microwave and optical/thermal satellite data. In addition to addressing key questions relating Greenland ice sheet balance to sea-level change, the project includes outreach to the public, primarily through a web site, and numerous educational impacts. The project would support undergraduate and graduate students, and involves investigators from a primarily undergraduate institution with a significant population of first-generation college students, and from a Hispanic-serving institution.

This is important because stability of the stratification of the ocean determines its circulation, heat transport and formation of deep water, which in turn affect the local and regional climate system, as well as ocean/atmosphere/climate interaction in lower latitudes. Thus understanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of lower salinity water (called 'freshwater') is of fundamental importance for understanding future states of the Arctic Ocean. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the region of the ocean north of Greenland, where water and sea ice ultimately take one of two pathways south. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. The project is especially interested in the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. For this purpose data collected as part of the Arctic Observing Network will be compared to model simulations and vice versa to test hypotheses concerning the circulation, accumulation and release of freshwater and its components in the Arctic Ocean and to test the performance of an Arctic Ocean model. This project will create data products for researchers and educators interested in the Arctic and its response to climate change. Circulation patterns of the individual freshwater components and other synthesized outputs, along with information and documentation needed to assist educators, will be made publicly available through an online site that is expected to have significant traffic from educators in academia and secondary school levels. This project will provide the core of a PhD dissertation for a graduate student. <br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Understanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of freshwater is of fundamental importance for examining possible future scenarios of the freshwater lens covering the Arctic Ocean, the role of freshwater in internal circulation within the Arctic, and the role of freshwater in deep water formation in the convective regions of the Nordic seas and the North Atlantic. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the Switchyard (SY) region in the context of an Arctic Ocean-wide analysis of freshwater component sources and pathways. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. There will be special emphasis on the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. <br/><br/>Recent long-term observations conducted in the Switchyard (SY) region as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) program, have revealed detailed information on both the total freshwater balance, and the components contributing to it: Pacific Water (PW), Meteoric Water (MW: River Runoff and P-E), and Sea Ice Meltwater (SIMW). The SY observations along a section between Alert and the North Pole show rapid changes in the contributions of individual freshwater components to the total inventory along with gradual changes in the total freshwater content. From backtracking the surface circulation in time based on sea ice drift patterns, the group infers that the rapid changes in the freshwater components are probably due to shifts in the sea ice and surface water source regions and pathways on time scales as short as one year, the frequency of their observations. <br/><br/>This project will combine the SY freshwater component data with those from previous (icebreaker) expeditions to characterize the main features of their distributions. In a second step, the team will extend the sea ice tracking method developed by Maslanik and Fowler to include Ekman transport in the surface ocean and will download GCM runs that simulate individual FW components. They will track the observed freshwater components back to their source regions, and forward to their exit points from the Arctic, and will identify mechanisms impacting the freshwater component circulation, especially in the SY region where they have an 8-year time series. The principal intellectual contributions will come from integrating observed freshwater component inventories and pathways with those obtained from model simulations, inferring the dynamics governing the freshwater component distributions and their adjustment as functions of source terms and atmospheric forcing."

Multinational investments in geophysical infrastructure over the last few decades, especially broadband seismometers operating for several years, are allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes. To specifically leverage those past investments, we will analyze past and current data to gain a better understanding of Antarctic seismicity. Our recent research revealed that certain large earthquakes occurring elsewhere in the world triggered ice movement near various stations throughout Antarctica. We plan to conduct an exhaustive search of the terabytes of available data, using cutting-edge computational techniques, to uncover additional evidence for ice crevassing, ice stream slip, and earth movement during earthquakes. One specific focus of our research will include investigating whether some of these phenomena may be triggered by external influences, including passing surface waves from distant earthquakes, ocean tides, or seasonal melt. We plan to produce a catalog of the identified activity and share it publicly, so the public and researchers can easily access it. To reach a broader audience, we will present talks to high school classes, including Advanced Placement classes, in the Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas with emphasis on general aspects of seismic hazard, climate variability, and the geographies of Antarctica. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, training for graduate students, and support for an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>In recent years, a new generation of geodetic and seismic instrumentation has been deployed as permanent stations throughout Antarctica (POLENET), in addition to stations deployed for shorter duration (less than 3 years) experiments (e.g. AGAP/TAMSEIS). These efforts are providing critical infrastructure needed to address fundamental questions about both crustal-scale tectonic structures and ice sheets, and their interactions.  We plan to conduct a systematic detection of tectonic and icequake activities in Antarctica, focusing primarily on background seismicity, remotely-triggered seismicity, and glacier slip events. Our proposed tasks include: (1) Identification of seismicity throughout the Antarctic continent for both tectonic and ice sources. (2) An exhaustive search for additional triggered events in Antarctica during the last ~15 years of global significant earthquakes. (3) Determination of triggered source mechanisms and whether those triggered events also occur at other times, by analyzing years of data using a matched-filter analysis (where the triggered local event is used to detect similar events). (4) Further analysis of GPS measurements over a ~5.5 year period from Whillans Ice Plain, which suggests that triggering of stick-slip events occurred after the largest earthquakes. An improved knowledge of how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to external perturbations such as dynamic stresses from large distant earthquakes and recent ice unloading could lead to a better understanding of ice failure and related dynamic processes. By leveraging the vast logistical investment to install seismometers in Antarctica over the last decade, our project will build an exhaustive catalog of tectonic earthquakes, icequakes, calving events, and any other detectable near-surface seismic phenomena."

However, the lack of information on subglacial and grounding-line environments causes large uncertainties in projections of mass loss and sea-level rise. This project will integrate geologic data from the deglaciated continental shelf into numerical models of varying complexity from one to three-dimensions. Rarely do numerical ice-sheet models of Antarctica have multiple constraints on dynamics over the past ~15,000 years (a period that spans the deglaciation of the Antarctic continental shelf since the Last Glacial Maximum).  The geologic constraints include grounding-line positions, deglacial chronologies, and information on grounding line-ice shelf processes.   The models will be used to investigate necessary perturbations and controls that meet the geological constraints.

Measuring the quantity of the rare isotopes enables the length of time that the rock or soil has been exposed to the atmosphere to be calculated.  <br/><br/>The distribution of cosmic rays around the globe depends on Earth's magnetic field, and this distribution must be accurately known if useful exposure ages are to be obtained.  Currently there are two remaining theories, narrowed down from many, of how to calculate this distribution.  Measurements from a site that is at both high altitude and high latitude (close to the poles) are needed to test the two theories.  This study involves both field and lab research and includes a Ph.D. student and an undergraduate student.   The research team will collect rocks from lava flows on an active volcano in Antarctica named Mount Erebus and measure the amounts of two rare isotopes: 36Cl and 3He.  The age of eruption of the samples will be determined using a highly accurate method that does not depend on cosmic rays, called 40Ar/39Ar dating.  The two cosmic-ray theories will be used to calculate the ages of the samples using the 36Cl and 3He concentrations and will then be compared to the ages calculated from the 40Ar/39Ar dating.  The accurate cosmic-ray theory will be the one that gives the same ages as the 40Ar/39Ar dating.  Identification of the accurate theory will enable use of the cosmogenic surface dating methods anywhere on earth. <br/><br/>Technical Description:  Nuclides produced by cosmic rays in rocks at the surface of the earth are widely used for Quaternary geochronology and geomorphic studies and their use is increasing every year. The recently completed CRONUS-Earth Project (Cosmic-Ray Produced Nuclides on Earth) has systematically evaluated the production rates and theoretical underpinnings of cosmogenic nuclides. However, the CRONUS-Earth Project was not able to discriminate between the two leading theoretical approaches: the original Lal model (St) and the new Lifton-Sato-Dunai model (LSD). Mathematical models used to scale the production of the nuclides as a function of location on the earth, elevation, and magnetic field configuration are an essential component of this dating method. The inability to distinguish between the two models was because the predicted production rates did not differ sufficiently at the location of the calibration sites. <br/><br/>The cosmogenic-nuclide production rates that are predicted by the two models differ significantly from each other at Erebus volcano, Antarctica. Mount Erebus is therefore an excellent site for testing which production model best describes actual cosmogenic-nuclide production variations over the globe. The research team recently measured 3He and 36Cl in mineral separates extracted from Erebus lava flows. The exposure ages for each nuclide were reproducible within each flow (~2% standard deviation) and in very good agreement between the 3He and the 36Cl ages. However, the ages calculated by the St and LSD scaling methods differ by ~15-25% due to the sensitivity of the production rate to the scaling at this latitude and elevation. These results lend confidence that Erebus qualifies as a suitable high- latitude/high-elevation calibration site. The remaining component that is still lacking is accurate and reliable independent (i.e., non-cosmogenic) ages, however, published 40Ar/39Ar ages are too imprecise and typically biased to older ages due to excess argon contained in melt inclusions.<br/><br/>The research team's new 40Ar/39Ar data show that previous problems with Erebus anorthoclase geochronology are now overcome with modern mass spectrometry and better sample preparation.  This indicates a high likelihood of success for this proposal in defining an accurate global scaling model. Although encouraging, much remains to be accomplished.  This project will sample lava flows over 3 km in elevation and determine their 40Ar/39Ar and exposure ages. These combined data will discriminate between the two scaling methods, resulting in a preferred scaling model for global cosmogenic geochronology. The LSD method contains two sub-methods, the 'plain' LSD scales all nuclides the same, whereas LSDn scales each nuclide individually. The project can discriminate between these models using 3He and 36Cl data from lava flows at different elevations, because the first model predicts that the production ratio for these two nuclides will be invariant with elevation and the second that there should be ~10% difference over the range of elevations to be sampled. Finally, the project will provide a local, finite-age calibration site for cosmogenic-nuclide investigations in Antarctica."

To forecast, and thus mitigate that impact, it is necessary to develop accurate understanding of the interaction processes between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. These processes are mainly initiated on the planet's dayside and can be observed at high latitudes in both hemispheres, near the ionospheric intersection of geomagnetic field lines that map from the high-altitude interaction region. A variety of coupled phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales are produced by this interaction that transfer the solar wind energy and momentum through the magnetosphere down to the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. Developing our understanding of these interaction processes and how they couple to both polar ionospheres is important for developing physical models that can describe and predict ""space weather"" disturbances ? a major goal of the recently adopted National Space Weather Strategy. This goal has been hampered so far by the lack of sufficient data to investigate processes and to validate global models, particularly in the Southern hemisphere.<br/><br/>This award will overcome the above problem through the operation and use of data from a new generation of autonomous instrument platforms strategically deployed in the Southern polar cap. This research will continue studies of various physical mechanisms involved in the solar wind interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere for better understanding of the multi-scale, global, and interhemispheric electrodynamic coupling within the entire Geospace system. Important aspects of these investigations include operation of a new chain of autonomous low-power ground-based instruments deployed along the 40-degree geomagnetic meridian in the East Antarctic. These stations are geomagnetically conjugate to the Greenland West Coast chain of long-term-running magnetometers supported by Danish scientists. These interhemispheric connections are crucial for interpretation of satellite observations (such NASA's THEMIS and MMS missions) in and near the magnetopause and for further understanding of the global geospace system's dynamics. The project will employ young scientists in the operation of remote Antarctic stations, as well as investigate space weather events, and, thus, contribute to the development of the nation?s scientific workforce. Use of the project's data to validate space weather models can provide benefit to society as a whole as it aids to protect various navigation, communications, and defense technologies that can be impacted by space weather."

Complementary glider sensors measuring physical, chemical, and biological parameters will provide mesoscale and sub-mesoscale hydrographic information from which phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish interactions and the relationships between these organisms and physics drivers (sea ice, circulation features) will be investigated. The approach proposed here, glider acoustics, is relatively new and has the potential to be transformational for investigating food webs and the Ross Sea ecosystem. <br/><br/>Researchers will modify and integrate an Acoustic Zooplankton and Fish Profiler (AZFP) multi-frequency echo sounder into a Slocum Webb G2 glider with the capability to differentiate between krill and other types of zooplankton, including copepods, and different sizes of krill and silverfish.

The seismic velocity models will reveal features including crustal thinning due to rifting in West Antarctica, the structures associated with mountain building, and the boundaries between different tectonic blocks. The models will be compared to continents that are better understood geologically to constrain the tectonic evolution of Antarctica. In addition, the work will provide better insight into how the solid earth interacts with and influences the development of the ice sheet. Surface heat flow will be mapped and used to identify regions in Antarctica with potential melting at the base of the ice sheet. This melt can lead to reduced friction and lower resistance to ice sheet movement.  The models will help to determine whether the earth response to ice mass changes occurs over decades, hundreds, or thousands of years. Estimates of mantle viscosity calculated from the seismic data will be used to better understand the pattern and timescales of the response of the solid earth to changes in ice mass in various parts of Antarctica.<br/><br/>The study will advance our knowledge of the structure of Antarctica by constructing two new seismic models and a thermal model using different but complementary methodologies.

It is also the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, and thus its deposits and landforms contain unique records of past climate not accessible elsewhere in the Antarctic continent or the world. In order to accurately interpret any geologic feature, however, we must understand how it forms and changes through time. In particular, in the Dry Valleys, we have a poor understanding of the rates and causes of one of Earth's most fundamental geologic phenomenon - physical rock breakdown. For example, the Dry Valleys lack moisture, which is thought to play a key role in rock breakdown in most other locations on the planet. What serves to fracture rocks in this seemingly inert environment? This project aims to answer that question by 'listening' as rocks crack in the Dry Valleys. We will instrument boulders with sensors that act as miniature seismographs, recording even the smallest microcracking on and within the rocks. At the same time, we will monitor the weather and environment around the rocks to record the conditions that trigger cracking events. While we collect these data, we will gather rock samples from deposits of different ages (from thousands to millions of years old) in the Dry Valleys. Measurements on these samples will allow us to see how quickly rocks breakdown and how their characteristics change over geologic time. The combined datasets will allow future scientists to more accurately understand the paleoclimates and landscapes of Antarctica, and possibly even Mars.  This project will also serve to support two female investigators in a field where women are still largely underrepresented. The project will also provide unique exposure and experience to students, ranging from elementary students to the undergraduate and graduate students who will be working directly on various aspects of the project. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Rocks in the McMurdo Dry Valleys experience some of the lowest erosion rates on Earth. However, our current understanding of the relative role that different weathering factors (moisture, freezing temperatures, thermal cycling, salt crystallization or hydration, and wind abrasion) play in these and other environments is limited. Further, in the Dry Valleys, there has been no systematic evaluation of the variance in weathering and associated rock erosion rates, which may change significantly as a function of subaerial exposure duration, lithology, and texture. This research seeks to (1) characterize the primary drivers of rock breakdown, (2) better quantify erosion rates, and (3) determine the lithological and environmental factors that influence weathering and erosion in the Dry Valleys. Rock breakdown (cracking) will be recorded in real-time on in situ boulders using a custom acoustic emission monitoring system. By coupling acoustic emission data with micrometeorological measurements at and near rock surfaces, this study will directly test hypotheses relating to the environmental drivers of rock breakdown under this unique polar desert climate over short (minute to monthly) timescales. Cosmogenic nuclide techniques including a novel combination of 6 isotopes (Be-10, Al-26, He-3, Ne-21, Cl-36, C-14) together with rock property measurements (e.g., strength, elastic moduli, thermal properties) will be used to elucidate the complex relationship between long-term (kyr to Myr) boulder erosion rates, lithology, rock properties, and subaerial exposure duration. By synthesizing these measurements with short-term cracking data from the acoustic emission system, the proposed work will thoroughly examine which lithological and environmental factors and grain-scale processes are driving geomorphic evolution in the Dry Valleys. By constraining boulder erosion rates and determining their sensitivity to rock properties and age, the results will be directly applicable to cosmogenic nuclide exposure age studies in this region. Additionally, the resulting information on weathering processes and their relationship to rock morphology in the Dry Valleys can be used to address hypotheses as to formation of similar rock morphologies on Mars. The Project Investigators will participate in an elementary school outreach program run by Gonzaga University, and the project will support an undergraduate and graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multinational investments in geophysical infrastructure over the last few decades, especially broadband seismometers operating for several years, are allowing us to observe many interesting natural phenomena, including iceberg calving, ice stream slip, and tectonic earthquakes. To specifically leverage those past investments, we will analyze past and current data to gain a better understanding of Antarctic seismicity. Our recent research revealed that certain large earthquakes occurring elsewhere in the world triggered ice movement near various stations throughout Antarctica. We plan to conduct an exhaustive search of the terabytes of available data, using cutting-edge computational techniques, to uncover additional evidence for ice crevassing, ice stream slip, and earth movement during earthquakes. One specific focus of our research will include investigating whether some of these phenomena may be triggered by external influences, including passing surface waves from distant earthquakes, ocean tides, or seasonal melt. We plan to produce a catalog of the identified activity and share it publicly, so the public and researchers can easily access it. To reach a broader audience, we will present talks to high school classes, including Advanced Placement classes, in the Austin, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan areas with emphasis on general aspects of seismic hazard, climate variability, and the geographies of Antarctica. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduates, training for graduate students, and support for an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>In recent years, a new generation of geodetic and seismic instrumentation has been deployed as permanent stations throughout Antarctica (POLENET), in addition to stations deployed for shorter duration (less than 3 years) experiments (e.g. AGAP/TAMSEIS). These efforts are providing critical infrastructure needed to address fundamental questions about both crustal-scale tectonic structures and ice sheets, and their interactions.  We plan to conduct a systematic detection of tectonic and icequake activities in Antarctica, focusing primarily on background seismicity, remotely-triggered seismicity, and glacier slip events. Our proposed tasks include: (1) Identification of seismicity throughout the Antarctic continent for both tectonic and ice sources. (2) An exhaustive search for additional triggered events in Antarctica during the last ~15 years of global significant earthquakes. (3) Determination of triggered source mechanisms and whether those triggered events also occur at other times, by analyzing years of data using a matched-filter analysis (where the triggered local event is used to detect similar events). (4) Further analysis of GPS measurements over a ~5.5 year period from Whillans Ice Plain, which suggests that triggering of stick-slip events occurred after the largest earthquakes. An improved knowledge of how the Antarctic ice sheet responds to external perturbations such as dynamic stresses from large distant earthquakes and recent ice unloading could lead to a better understanding of ice failure and related dynamic processes. By leveraging the vast logistical investment to install seismometers in Antarctica over the last decade, our project will build an exhaustive catalog of tectonic earthquakes, icequakes, calving events, and any other detectable near-surface seismic phenomena."

Birds have a unique respiratory system that includes both air sacs and lungs (called parabronchi) and has a one-way, rather than bidirectional, air flow pattern. This allows a high proportion of the oxygen in inhaled air to be transferred into the blood so that it can be circulated by the cardiovascular system to the tissues. In diving birds such as the emperor penguin, the air sac-to-tissue oxygen delivery is essential to the dive capacity, and is one of the adaptations that allows this species to dive deeper than 500 meters. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the transfer of oxygen from air sacs to blood and the subsequent distribution of oxygen to tissues are poorly understood. The emperor penguin is ideal for investigation of this oxygen cascade because of its large body size, dive capacity, physiological data base, and the prior development of research techniques and protocols for this species. This study should provide insight into a) the mechanisms underlying the efficiency of the bird oxygen transport system, b) the physiological basis of penguin dive behavior, and the ability of penguins to adapt to environmental change, and c) perhaps, even the design of better therapeutic strategies and tools for treatment of respiratory disease.

These educational programs at SeaWorld have outreach to diverse groups of grade school and high school students. One graduate student will also be trained, and participate in Antarctic physiological research. <br/><br/>This project will examine the transport of oxygen from air sacs to tissues in a series of studies with temporarily captive emperor penguins that are free-diving at an isolated dive hole research camp in McMurdo Sound. Physiological data will be obtained with application of backpack recorders for the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in air sacs and/or blood, and backpack heart rate/stroke rate recorders.

Much of this carbon uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where water from the deep ocean comes to the surface. How much water ""up-wells,"" and therefore how much carbon is absorbed, is believed to depend on the strength and location of the major westerly winds in the southern hemisphere.  These wind patterns have been shifting southward in recent decades, and future changes could impact the global carbon cycle and promote the circulation of relatively warm water from the deep ocean on to the continental shelf, which contributes to enhanced Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise. Understanding of the westerly winds and their role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the circulation of ocean water is therefore very important.   The work supported by this award will study past movement of the SH westerlies in response to natural climate variations. Of particular interest is the last deglaciation (20,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the global climate made a transition from an ice age climate to the current warm period.  During this period, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from about 180 ppm to 270 parts per million, and one leading hypothesis is that the rise in carbon dioxide was driven by a southward movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies.

Research shows that a lack of self-determination, either at the community level or the individual level, can negatively affect one's health and well-being, which includes educational and economic achievement, as well as the long-term sustainability of social and cultural systems.  This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant project collaborates with an Alaska Native community to explore how Tribal members and nontribal members use self-determination, either individually or as a group, to achieve sustainability and wellbeing.  A deeper understanding of the relationship between self-determination and wellbeing among Alaska Native peoples has the potential to provide insights into the health and wellbeing of other Indigenous Tribes and minority groups in the United States.  This information could be critical to national interests by informing better education, health, and economic policies leading to the health and wellbeing of all people in the nation. <br/> <br/>Paragraph 2<br/>This project uses the method of ethnographic futures research to conduct interviews about the future as envisioned by community members in South Central Alaska.

Working with an Alaska Native community, focus groups and a community meeting will be conducted following the interviews to talk about the ideas identified in the interview optimistic scenarios and how to achieve those ideas. The analysis of this data has the potential to demonstrate what Tribal and nontribal members think the Tribe can do to improve sustainability and wellbeing, and how to achieve those goals. The data has the potential to inform others, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, by demonstrating how utilizing futures research can engage community members in self-determining acts through planning, and potentially making changes, for better outcomes in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. <br/><br/>The project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region?s ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums."

Geologic samples allow exploration of potential mechanisms for carbon dioxide drawdown during glacial periods through the use of geochemical proxies. Nitrogen and silicon isotope signatures from fossil diatoms (microscopic plants) are used to investigate changes in the physical supply and biological demand for nutrients (like nitrogen and silicon and carbon) in the Southern Ocean. The project will evaluate the use the nitrogen and silicon isotope proxies through a series of laboratory experiments and Southern Ocean field sampling. The results will provide quantification of real relationships between nitrogen and silicon isotopes and nutrient usage in the Southern Ocean and allow exploration of the role of other factors, including biological diversity, ice cover, and mixing, in altering the chemical signatures recorded by diatoms. Seafloor sediment samples will be used to evaluate how well the signal created in the water column is recorded by fossil diatoms buried in the seafloor. Improving the nutrient isotope proxies will allow for a more quantitative understanding of the role of polar biology in regulating natural variation in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The project will also result in the training of a graduate student and development of outreach materials targeting a broad popular audience.<br/><br/>This project seeks to test the fidelity of the diatom nitrogen and silicon isotope proxies, two commonly used paleoceanographic tools for investigating the role of the Southern Ocean biological pump in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations on glacial-interglacial timescales. Existing ground-truthing data, including culture experiments, surface sediment data and downcore reconstructions, all suggest that nutrient utilization is the primary driver of isotopic variation in the Southern Ocean. However, strong contribution of interspecific variation is implied by recent culture results. Moreover, field and laboratory studies present some contradictory results in terms of the relative importance of interspecific variation and of inferred  post-depositional alteration of the nutrient isotope signals. Here, a first order test of the N and Si diatom nutrient isotope paleo-proxies, involving water column dissolved and particulate sampling and laboratory culturing of field-isolates, is proposed. Southern Ocean water, biomass, live diatoms and fossil diatom sampling will be conducted to investigate species and assemblage related variability in diatom nitrogen and silicon isotopes and their relationship to surface nutrient fields and early diagenesis. Access to fresh materials produced in an analogous environmental context to the sediments of primary interest is critical for making robust paleoceanographic reconstructions. Field sampling will occur along 175W, transecting the Antarctic Circumpolar Current from the subtropics to the marginal ice edge. Collection of water, sinking/suspended particles and multi-core samples from 13 stations and 3 shipboard incubation experiments will be used to test four proposed hypotheses that together evaluate the significance of existing culture results and seek to allow the best use of diatom nutrient isotope proxies in evaluating the biological pump."

Much of this carbon uptake occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where water from the deep ocean comes to the surface. How much water ""up-wells,"" and therefore how much carbon is absorbed, is believed to depend on the strength and location of the major westerly winds in the southern hemisphere.  These wind patterns have been shifting southward in recent decades, and future changes could impact the global carbon cycle and promote the circulation of relatively warm water from the deep ocean on to the continental shelf, which contributes to enhanced Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise. Understanding of the westerly winds and their role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and the circulation of ocean water is therefore very important.   The work supported by this award will study past movement of the SH westerlies in response to natural climate variations. Of particular interest is the last deglaciation (20,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the global climate made a transition from an ice age climate to the current warm period.  During this period, atmospheric carbon dioxide rose from about 180 ppm to 270 parts per million, and one leading hypothesis is that the rise in carbon dioxide was driven by a southward movement of the southern hemisphere westerlies.

In the past, ocean transport through this region may have played a key role in climate fluctuations. In the future, disappearing Arctic ice may make the Bering Strait the Pacific gateway to an Arctic ship route between the Pacific and Atlantic. Lying at the southern end of the Bering Strait is the Bering Sea, a shallow continental shelf hosting some of the most valuable fisheries in the U.S. and huge populations of marine wildlife. Although winds on average blow southward through the Strait, the average flow of ocean currents is northward, carrying nutrients, heat, and fresh water into the Arctic. Previous work suggests that a pressure head at the southern end of the Strait drives flow to the north against the southward wind, and evidence suggests that this pressure head has increased by about 70% since 2001. The origin of year-to-year and longer-term variability of this pressure head is unknown. This project will combine existing data on sea surface height, coastal sea level, theory, and modeling to understand changes in the pressure head and the basic dynamics of the Bering Sea continental shelf.  A graduate student will be supported. <br/> <br/>The Bering Strait connects the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, and serves as a conduit of nutrients, heat, and fresh water. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing that connection will help predict current and future regional ocean conditions. Analysis of satellite altimetry, coastal sea level, theory, and a model will be used to: determine the origin and dynamics of the low-frequency pressure head that drives flow through the Bering Strait into the Arctic; understand the origin and basic dynamics of the interannual sea level and flow on the wide Bering Sea shelf; and determine the low-frequency variability of volume, heat, and fresh water flux of the Alaskan Coastal Current.  A wealth of along-track satellite altimeter data available from TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason1,2,3 (TPJ123) will be used to address the question of what drives the Bering Sea pressure head. Preliminary analysis suggests that a major contributor to the low-frequency Bering Strait pressure head originates on the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf. This contribution is communicated along the Gulf of Alaska coastal wave guide, through Unimak Pass in the Aleutian Arc, onto the shallow Bering Sea shelf wave guide, and then through the Bering Strait. A second factor is the interannual and lower frequency signal generated on the Bering Sea shelf."

Three August-September cruises, one every two years, will be conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes.  The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography.  The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON.  Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy."

The mechanical properties of ice depend largely on the temperature and the orientation of the crystals that make up the ice.  The most accurate method for measuring ice crystal orientation and temperature is through drilling and direct analysis of an ice core.  However, this method is very costly, time-consuming, and limited in spatial coverage.  Geophysical techniques, such as seismic and radar, can cover much more area, but we have little knowledge about the practical limitations of these techniques as they relate to calculating mechanical properties.  This project addresses that knowledge gap through construction of a computational toolbox that will allow accurate assessment of the ability of geophysical surveys to image crystal orientation and ice temperature.  Researchers can then use these tools to adjust the field survey plans to maximize the return on investment.  By working to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future geophysical work related to glacial flow, this proposal will improve scientists? ability to quantify sea-level variations within the larger context of climate change.  The project includes building new user-friendly, publicly accessible software and instructional modules.  The work will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, who will play a role in research and develop instructional materials. <br/><br/>Ice viscosity, the resistance of ice to flow, exerts significant control over ice velocity.  Therefore, mapping ice viscosity is important for understanding the current and future behavior of glaciers and ice sheets.  To do so, scientists must determine the temperature and crystal orientation fabric throughout the ice. Seismic and radar techniques can survey large areas quickly, and thus are promising, yet not fully tested, methods to efficiently measure the thermal and mechanical structure of flowing ice.  As part of this project, scientists will develop and use a computational framework to quantify the degree to which seismic and radar techniques can resolve the crystal orientation fabric and temperature of streaming ice, and then test how sensitive ice flow is to the attendant uncertainty.  To meet these goals, a numerical toolbox will be built which will allow the glacier/ice stream geometry and physical properties (temperature, crystal orientation fabric, density and acidity) to be varied. The toolbox will be capable of both creating synthetic radar and seismic profiles through forward modeling and inverting synthetic profiles to allow evaluation of how well geophysical techniques can image the original thermal and mechanical structure. These simulated radar and seismic data will allow scientists to better quantify the influence of the variability in mechanical properties of the ice on flow velocities and patterns.  The results of this work will guide planning for future field campaigns, making them more effective and efficient. This project does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic."

Such estimates rely on field measurements or remotely sensed based observations of the ice sheet surface, ice margins, and or ice shelves. This work examines the introduction of freshwater into the ocean to surrounding Antarctica to track meltwater from continental ice.  Polar ice is depleted in two stable isotopes, 18O and D, deuterium, relative to Southern Ocean seawater and precipitation. Measurements of seawater isotopic composition in conjunction with precise observations of seawater temperature and salinity, will permit discrimination of freshwater derived from melting glacial ice from that derived from regional precipitation or sea ice melt.<br/><br/>This research describes an accepted method for determining rates and locations of meltwater entering the oceans from polar ice sheets. As isotopic and salinity perturbations are cumulative in many Antarctic coastal seas, the method allows for the detection of any marked acceleration in meltwater introduction in specific regions, using samples collected and analyzed over a period of years to decades. Impact of the project derives from use of an independent method capable of constraining knowledge about current ice sheet melt rates, their stability and potential impact on sea level rise. The project allows for sample collection taken from foreign vessels of opportunity sailing in Antarctic waters, and subsequent sharing and interpretation of data. Research partners include the U.S., Korea, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Participating collaborators will collect seawater samples for isotopic and salinity analysis at Stanford University. USAP cruises will concentrate on sampling the Ross Sea, and the West Antarctic.

The unique and potentially transformative aspect of this project is that unmanned aircraft collect data at small spatial and temporal scales, providing new information about variability in temperature, humidity, and winds.

Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.  The project will also provide support for the training two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The associated mentoring plan is very good.  Outreach to the general public will be enhanced by leveraging the PIs? home institutions? activities.  The PIs will continue established interactions with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service.  These include public lectures, as well as training for interpretive rangers who can reach a broad cross-cut of the public.  Finally, they will develop a brochure concerning their work to further enhance their public outreach.<br/><br/>This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier.  This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community.  It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to<br/>i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,<br/>ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,<br/>iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and<br/>iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.<br/>Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide<br/>i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and<br/>ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.<br/>Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements. The latter will allow investigation of the impact of submarine melting on glacier dynamics over seasonal timescales."

This project focuses on the adaptations of copepods - small animals that live in the water column and are an important food source to many different predators. The field studies will take place in the western Antarctic Peninsula, an environment and ecosystem that is rapidly changing. Antarctic copepods have developed particular feeding and behavioral strategies to survive in their very seasonal environment, however it is not known how each of these species will respond to environmental change. The overall goal of this project is to examine and compare these adaptations across species and to understand how each species responds to short-term changes in food availability. The project contains three main objectives: the first objective is to compare the sets of genes across species, especially looking at genes related to storage of energy from food. The second objective is to measure and compare the responses of copepods to changes in food availability. The third objective is to determine how variation across the western Antarctic Pensinsula habitat affects the feeding condition of the copepods.  To make the data more useful to the broader research community, a database will be developed enabling easy comparison of genetic information between copepod species. This project will provide hands-on training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate student and will seek to recruit students from underrepresented groups. Results and scientific concepts will be shared through outreach activities, including an expedition blog, a series of interactive animations, and public presentations.<br/><br/>Polar marine organisms have adapted to dramatic seasonal changes in photoperiod, light intensity, and ice cover, as well as to cold but stable thermal environments. The western Antarctic Peninsula, the focal region for the field studies, has experienced rapid warming and ice melt. While it is difficult to predict exactly how physical conditions in this region will change, effects on species distributions have already been documented. Large Antarctic copepods in the families Calanidae and Rhincalanidae are dominant components of the mesozooplankton that use different metabolic and behavioral strategies to optimize their use of a highly seasonal food supply. The overall goal of this project is to leverage molecular approaches to examine the physiological and metabolic adaptations at the individual and species level. The project focuses on three main objectives: the first objective is to characterize the gene complement and stage-specific gene expression patterns in Antarctic copepods within an evolutionary context. The second objective is to measure and compare the physiological and molecular responses of juvenile copepods to variable feeding conditions. The third objective is to characterize metabolic variation within natural copepod populations. The metabolically diverse Antarctic copepods also provide an excellent opportunity to compare mechanisms regulating energy storage and utilization and to test hypotheses regarding the roles of specific genes. The field studies will aim to utilize information from an ongoing long term research program (the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research), which complements the ongoing program and provides extensive context for this project. To make the data more useful to the research community, a database will be developed facilitating comparison of transcriptomes between copepod species. This project will provide hands-on training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students. Efforts will be made to recruit students who are members of underrepresented minorities. Results and scientific concepts will be broadly disseminated through an expedition blog, a series of interactive animations, and public presentations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will test the following hypotheses based on data from two target species (Picea glauca and Alnus viridis): (1) Multiple Last Glacial Maximum refugia existed for each species in isolated areas nested in a complex topography, and the locations of these refugia differed between species; (2) Some of the refugial populations expanded to form modern species ranges whereas others remained largely restricted to their Last Glacial Maximum locations; (3) Within and between species, refugial populations spread at different rates and in different directions during the early postglacial period; and (4) Glacial refugia existed in areas with low climate velocity, and the directions and rates of postglacial colonization were determined by the spatial patterns of climate velocity. Graduate and undergraduate students will receive transdisciplinary training and gain a broad perspective to global change study. This project will provide intellectual focus, financial resources, and mentorship for the career development of three young investigators. Research results will be disseminated broadly to the scientific community, the public, and land managers. The centerpiece of the outreach activities is a workshop to educate high school teachers on Arctic climate and ecological changes. Through these teachers, a large group of midwestern students will be exposed to the excitement of Arctic research. Materials from the workshop will be disseminated online to a broad audience. <br/><br/>The approach will integrate genomic analysis, species distribution modeling that involves remote-sensing techniques, climate-velocity mapping, and existing fossil data in a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework. The proposed research will uncover cryptic glacial refugia in the study region, elucidate the landscape and climate contexts for refugial populations, and offer new insights into population dynamics in late-Quaternary vegetation development. The project promises to provide spatially explicit, population-level details of species range shifts in relation to climate change that cannot be reliably acquired using conventional paleoecological analyses. Equally important, this project may serve as a model demonstrating the utility of a crosscutting approach to investigate the impacts of climate change on plant population processes in the paleorecord. The novel approach that will be developed through this project presents an opportunity to advance Arctic paleoecology and foster next generation research and training in the discipline.<br/>"

A significant contribution during the past decades has been from mountain glaciers, but the contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet is anticipated to become dominant in the near future.  This contribution is delivered to the ocean as both meltwater and icebergs that melt in the fjords and coastal ocean around Greenland.  These contributions vary spatially.  The proposed work will develop a model of Greenland's contribution to sea level rise, constrain the model using observed data, and estimate contributions based on scenarios of future climate.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to STEM workforce development by providing support for the training of two graduate students.  It will also provide support for a beginning investigator during the formative years of his career.  It will contribute to the community resources by maintaining and enhancing the open source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) code for community use.<br/><br/>Four possible controls on outlet glacier systems dynamics have been identified: <br/>1) Warming subsurface ocean water and/or increased subglacial runoff may increase submarine ice melting at the glacier-fjord interface;<br/>2) Rigid sea ice and ice mlange (a mixture of sea ice and icebergs) may suppress calving, allowing for terminus advance; <br/>3) The terminus position relative to subglacial topography (e.g., over-deepenings or sills) influences rates of retreat; and <br/>4) Changes in the resistive stress caused by contact with the fjord walls and/or glacier bed can lead to terminus advance, retreat, and/or thinning.<br/>Previous simulations of ice sheet contributions to sea level rise have been limited by the insufficient spatial resolution of models and observational data, which prevented whole-ice sheet simulations to faithfully capture outlet glacier flow. Results to date are either obtained from regional models or from highly idealized flow line models that were upscaled to ice-sheet scale. Recent advances in ice sheet modeling, and the availability of high-resolution subglacial topography, now allow one to resolve individual outlet glacier flow in ice sheet-wide simulations. This project will use the framework of the open-source Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), uni-directionally coupled to new high-resolution hindcasts of the atmosphere and ocean. This will provide a test bed for assessing, on a glacier-by-glacier basis: <br/>1) what is the relative present-day influence of the four controls on outlet glacier flow and ice discharge; <br/>2) what is the potential for a substantial increase in 21st century ice discharge; <br/>3) what conditions would precipitate large changes (e.g., spatio-temporal distribution of ocean warming, enhanced surface runoff); and <br/>4) what observations are required in support of a Greenland Ice Sheet Ocean Observing System to capture the forcing or onset of large changes? <br/>Comparison to available remotely-sensed and in-situ observations, including, but not limited to, time-series of surface velocities, surface elevation, and mass changes will serve as metrics of success. Simulations of the 21st century evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet will then be performed, forced by available atmosphere-ocean projections, to provide realistic estimates of future ice discharge."

Subsistence hunting often provides a large fraction of foods, and may be more reliable in the long term than a cash economy based on nonrenewable resources.  Subsistence hunting for certain species may also have cultural significance that far exceeds their dietary contribution.  On the Chukchi Sea coast, pipelines connecting offshore oil wells to onshore terminals must be built across a nearshore corridor used by most marine birds and mammals that migrate to the western North American Arctic. These animals are hunted for subsistence by local Natives.  During spring, these animals travel through a zone of open water that forms between landfast ice and moving pack ice.  If an oil pipeline were ruptured by spring ice scour in this shallow zone, oil could probably not be removed from open water within broken ice during migration.  Such an event could not only restrict the extent of viable habitat, but also eliminate local hunting areas.  Thus, key habitats that are usually accessible to hunting should be avoided in pipeline placement.  In this research, we will model habitat requirements and map viable prey densities for a formerly hunted but now threatened species (Spectacled Eider, SPEI) and a commonly hunted species (King Eider, KIEI) in the Chukchi nearshore zone, and determine long-term variability in the eiders? access to those areas through the ice.  We will refine these maps with traditional ecological knowledge on conditions and areas where hunting for KIEI typically occurs.  We will then estimate probabilities that different eider feeding areas that are accessible through the ice and conducive to hunting would be eliminated during migration by oil spills from pipelines built along four alternative routes.  We will use this information to inform structured decision-making workshops we will hold in the Native community.  These workshops will help create a local vision for sustainability, in terms of potential risks of different pipeline routes to subsistence and cultural values of eiders, relative to cash benefits of local construction projects.<br/><br/>Local villagers will be involved in creating and shaping the data set, and will be the main participants in structured decision-making workshops.  We will integrate our work with outreach and education programs conducted in these villages by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Our project will yield important information for future evaluations and decision-making by Endangered Species and Migratory Bird Management Offices.  Our modern scientific and traditional ecological data, and facilitation of community consensus-building, will expedite later impact assessments by BOEM and other agencies as oilfield development proceeds.  On a hemispheric scale, the approach we develop will serve as a prototype applicable to the many such situations developing across the Arctic."

The measurements made as part of this project will result in a much longer temperature record, extending at least 40,000 years, aiding our ability to understand what controls Antarctic climate, and improving projections of future Antarctic climate change. Data from this project will be critical to other investigators working on the South Pole ice core, and of general interest to other scientists and the public.  Data will be provided rapidly to other investigators and made public as soon as possible.<br/><br/>This project will obtain records of the stable-isotope ratios of water on the ice core currently being obtained at South Pole. The core will reach a depth of 1500 m and an age of 40,000 years. The project will use laser spectroscopy to obtain both an ultra-high-resolution record of oxygen 18/16 and deuterium-hydrogen ratios, and a lower-resolution record of oxygen 17/16 ratios. The high-resolution measurements will be used to aid in dating the core, and to provide estimates of isotope diffusion that constrain the process of firn densification. The novel 17/16 measurement provides additional constraints on the isotope fractionation due to the temperature-dependent supersaturation ratio, which affects the fractionation of water during the liquid-solid condensate transition. Together, these techniques will allow for improved accuracy in the use of the water isotope ratios as proxies for ice-sheet temperature, sea-surface temperature, and atmospheric circulation. The result will be a record of decadal through centennial and millennial scale climate change in a climatically distinct region in East Antarctica that has not been previously sampled by deep ice coring. The project will support a graduate student who will be co-advised by faculty at the University of Washington and the University of Colorado, and will be involved in all aspects of the work."

The motivation for this work lies in the critical role melting plays in ice-ocean interactions in polar regions, and consequent sea level rise, combined with the great difficulty currently encountered when making direct or indirect measurements of ice melting. Glacier ice contains bubbles of air, trapped by falling snow and compressed over time by increasing pressure due to the accumulation of overlying ice. The explosive release of gas trapped within the bubbles as ice melts at the front of the glacier radiates an intense pulse of sound into the water, making glacial bays and fjords some of the noisiest places on the planet. Because bubble release rate increases with increasing ice melt rate, it should be possible to use bubble-generated noise to quantify melt rate. This project will contribute to STEM workforce development by providing support for the training of a post-doctoral associate.  It will continue existing international collaborations with colleagues in Poland and Singapore.  Outreach will occur through contributions to an innovative, planned exhibit at the Birch Aquarium ? Expedition Earth!  Finally, a successful project will be an initial step in the development of a potentially transformative remote sensing technique for observing glacier-ocean interaction.<br/><br/><br/>This project will utilize a two-pronged effort to initiate development of an acoustic methodology for observing the melt rate of marine-terminating glaciers: direct measurement of the vertical distribution of noise sources on a terminus with a hydrophone array and recording the melting noise from large numbers of blocks of ice whose physical properties have been measured.  An approach for the analytical analysis of the field measurements and initial development of an inversion technique is based on earlier work modeling noise radiated from bubbles in breaking waves.   Data will be collected in front of a small group of glaciers terminating into a single fjord to address the following questions that presently limit the usefulness of acoustic data:<br/>1. What is the density, mean internal pressure and distributions of radii of bubbles in randomly selected samples of glacier ice, and how do these distributions correlate with ice density, which is a proxy for ice depth?<br/>2. How does the bubble source spectrum vary with hydrostatic pressure, bubble radius, internal gas pressure, and water temperature?<br/>3. What is the variability in the distributions of bubble properties between glaciers, and what are the minimal set of ice property measurements required to generalize the method from one to many glaciers? That is, what variables must be measured on a glacier-by-glacier basis to make the technique work across many glaciers?"

This is the first modern opportunity for such a comprehensive study of the yearly depositional flux of trace elements (TEs) into the Arctic ocean/ice ecosystem. The combination of 7-Be and aerosol TE measurements has been shown to be an effective tool for estimating the atmospheric input of TEs in remote ocean regions where nearby land-based collection sites do not exist. The data generated in this work will be available to allow ground-truthing of models of aerosol deposition and atmospheric input of TEs. Atmospheric deposition is the dominant pathway by which anthropogenically-derived trace elements, especially mercury (Hg), enter the Arctic Ocean, and recent literature suggests that atmospheric deposition of biologically-essential trace elements such as iron (Fe) could play a major role in controlling biological productivity in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Atmospheric transport and deposition of aerosols is an important delivery mechanism of natural and contaminant trace elements (TEs) to the Arctic. Existing data show that atmospheric deposition of contaminant elements like Hg, Pb, and Se may be a major input of these elements to the Arctic, with likely sources being anthropogenic - industrial or power plant emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion in Europe, Russia, and Asia. The atmospheric input of biologically-essential trace elements (e.g. Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) plays a key role in controlling biogeochemical processes in the ocean, and recent work suggests this might be true in the Arctic as well. These inputs have strong implications for the ecosystem, and even human health. Assessment of this input is difficult because measurements of deposition rates in remote ocean regions are scarce, and are particularly daunting to take in the Arctic because harsh conditions and limited research platforms make it difficult to obtain quality-controlled precipitation and aerosol chemistry measurements on a routine basis. This research will provide estimates of the yearly atmospheric deposition flux of aerosol TEs (total and soluble), including those of biogeochemical importance as well as pollutant species. The seasonal evolution of partitioning of trace element deposition among the various catchments (ice, water, snow, melt ponds) will also be assessed. The work will involve measurements of 7-Be inventories, 7-Be aerosol activities, and aerosol concentrations of TEs. Field work will be during a year-long ice drift of the MOSAiC expedition through the central Arctic Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will be a component of the MOSAiC expedition, an international initiative motivated by the rapidly evolving Arctic climate system, with thinning sea ice, warming ocean and atmosphere temperatures, strong climate feedbacks, and dramatic implications for society. MOSAiC has broad international support and has been endorsed by international and US institutions as a project that is critically needed to provide foundational information on the changing central Arctic system required to support coupled model development. The ability to provide estimates of the atmospheric input of relevant TEs to the Arctic Ocean will contribute widely to the field of chemical oceanography, including understanding anthropogenic impacts on the region and the role atmospheric input of TEs plays in Arctic Ocean ecology. The lead institution is one of the country's leading minority serving universities, and the lead researcher has undertaken a mentoring program for students involved in its research activities. The team will record short lectures and video logs that can be used in future iterations of his courses to introduce important oceanographic concepts and give his students a first-hand account of life aboard an oceanographic vessel. Other scientists will be asked to grant interviews to add to the breadth of perspectives, and the outreach will emphasize the role of basic scientific research in improving our understanding of natural phenomena and the planet's response to anthropogenic stressors."

Aufeis are massive accumulations of ice common to many arctic rivers, particularly in northeastern Siberia and the North Slope of Alaska. River aufeis form during freeze-up when thickening surface ice and permafrost restrict river discharge, causing water to overflow existing ice. Successive cycles of overflowing and freezing of water from upstream groundwater sources accumulate enormous quantities of ice, with late-winter aufeis on some rivers attaining thicknesses of 3 to 5 meters, covering up to 20 square kilometers in some Alaskan fields (even larger in Siberia), and storing as much as a third of the annual discharge of the river in the form of ice. In addition, aufeis maintain an unfrozen base throughout winter due to the release of latent heat as water is converted to ice, which warms the underlying sediments, and a thick insulating layer of ice above. Although aufeis have been studied by hydrologists and are known to be required for winter and spawning habitat for important local fish species, understanding of their ecology is poor. In recognition of this, these investigators will conduct a targeted assessment of the ecological importance of a single aufeis field on the Kuparuk River, Alaska as a first step toward developing a hypothesis-driven research program.<br/><br/>The investigators propose that aufeis be viewed as winter oases due to their wet bases that supply water and heat to otherwise frozen habitats. Aufeis also function as summer oases by providing a stable supply of water to riverbed and downstream habitats. This preliminary study will focus on assessing 1) river flow and nutrient chemistry above, within, and below the aufeis field, and 2) the potential for year-round, unfrozen habitat beneath the aufeis field. The investigators will collect water samples for nutrient analysis in transects extending 2.5 km upstream and downstream from the aufeis field. They will collect hourly data on river stage, temperature, and electrical conductivity along each transect. They will also install pairs of piezometers to depths of 1 meter and 2 meters to measure the vertical hydraulic gradient between the underlying aquifer and the surface channel, and dissolved oxygen, temperature, and electrical conductivity of hyporheic waters at these points. Measurements of vertical hydraulic gradient will determine whether river reaches are generally upwelling or downwelling. To estimate volume and the potential seasonal contributions of the aufeis to river discharge they will use precise digital elevation models created from low-altitude vertical photogrammetry. Year-round temperature and electrical conductivity records will provide data for simple end-member mixing analyses to determine the proportion of aufeis meltwater to the river during the thaw season. During freeze-up and into the winter, these records will provide estimates of potential downstream influences of the spring-water downstream of the aufeis if subsurface flow is maintained. In order to assess the vertical influence of aufeis, the investigators will instrument nine transects with digital temperature loggers. They anticipate that loggers directly under the aufeis will never record temperatures below freezing but that those outside the aufeis footprint will. The investigators also propose August and April ground-penetrating radar surveys to determine thaw depths. Finally, PVC wells penetrating about one meter below the surface will be used to sample small invertebrate animals living in river sediments and below aufeis. The project will support two masters-level graduate students and will involve two undergraduate field assistants in the summer fieldwork."

This has led to increased glacier melt, widespread glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses, and glacier speed-ups. Many of these changes are driven by changing precipitation and increased melt due to warmer air temperatures. This project will use a combination of two models - a regional atmospheric model and a model of processes at the glacier surface - to simulate future changes in temperature and snowfall, and the resulting changes in glacier mass. The combination of models will be tested against the observational record (since 1979 when satellite observations became available), to verify that it can reproduce observed change, and then run to the year 2100. Results will provide better estimates of the impacts of future climate changes over the Antarctic Pensinsula and the expected glacier mass changes driven by the evolving climate. <br/><br/>The project will use the large changes observed on the Peninsula to validate a model framework suitable for understanding the impact of these changes on the glaciers and ice shelves there, with the goal of developing optimally constrained future climate and surface mass change scenarios for the region. The framework will provide both a coherent picture of the impacts of past changes on the region's ice cover, and also the best available constraints on forcings that will determine ice mass loss from this region going forward under a standard scenario.  The Weather Forecasting and Research (WRF) Model will be used over the domain of the Antarctic Peninsula and neighboring islands to quantify trends in spatio-temporal patterns of mass change with a focus on surface melt. The WRF model will be enhanced to account for the specific conditions of glacier surfaces, and the modified model will be used to simulate climate conditions and resulting surface mass budgets and melt over the period 1979-2100. Tying modeled past climate changes to the surface and satellite-based observational record will provide a foundation for interpreting projected future change. Results will be validated using available weather station observations, surface mass-balance data, and satellite-derived records of melt.  The activity will foster partnerships through collaboration with colleagues in Spain, Germany and The Netherlands and will support an early-career postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students, introduce undergraduate and high-school students to original research and provide training of students through inclusion of data and results in course curriculums."

Nowhere have the changes been more pronounced, nor happened as quickly, as in the Arctic Ocean. Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. Our project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime, the cold inflowing water provides food for phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. After the water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a narrow current that flows eastward along the edge of the Beaufort Sea. As part of our project we will continue to maintain a mooring positioned in the center of the current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002, and during this time it has measured striking changes that need to be placed in the context of the evolving Arctic system. In addition, we will carry out shipboard surveys of the current and adjacent waters when we service the mooring, to provide a larger-scale view of the fate of the Pacific water.  Past data have been widely used by the oceanographic community - in both observational and modeling studies -and are included in the annual Arctic Report Card. One graduate student will be supported on the project. <br/><br/>The monitoring mooring is situated at 152 degrees W near the Beaufort Sea shelfbreak, roughly 150 km downstream of Pt. Barrow, AK. It will be deployed from fall 2018 to fall 2022 (in two 2-year installments). This will extend the timeseries at this location to 17 years. The mooring records the velocity of the water column and pack ice using two acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and measures temperature, salinity, and pressure using a series of sensors spaced along the wire. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate will be measured at 35 m (at the top float of the mooring), and a passive acoustic recorder situated near the base of the mooring will record marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration will be estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Among other things, this will allow us to determine how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and, importantly, assess how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. Upwelling occurs during all seasons along the Beaufort slope, and it appears to be increasing as the climate warms. The mooring is ideally suited to quantify the upwelling, as well as any downwelling that occurs. The shipboard sampling will include occupations of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects, which will contribute to that long-term study."

Past studies tell us that trade in the middle ages connected the North Atlantic islands to only one country. However, this scientist's earlier research showed that nearly 1,000 years ago the Vikings traded and sold cloth in London and other European markets. This means that 900 years ago, women in places as far away as the islands of the North Atlantic made cloth for markets in distant places. The reason this is important is because it suggests that women's work was key to developing commodity markets that were the ancestors of today's market. By understanding how early international trade began in the North Atlantic and expanded as far as the Volga river, the research will contribute knowledge about the emergence of today's more complicated trade systems, how trade affects women's labor, and how people make decisions about what to make and what to trade.<br/><br/>Paragraph 2: <br/>This scientific investigation will employ a mixed methodology to document and analyze textile collections from rural and urban, North Atlantic and European contexts.

Strontium isotope analyses and pXRF data of archaeological samples and modern wool will be carried out in order to map isotopic signatures geographically and provide insight into the movements of textiles and the compounds used in their production across long distances, such as to North America, northern Europe and Eurasia.

Previous studies of these sediments indicate that this community may consume much more of the regional productivity than previously estimated, suggesting that sediments are a rich and important component of this ecosystem and one that may be ripe for dramatic change. Furthermore, under richer sediment conditions, iron is mobilized and released back to the water column. Since productivity in this ecosystem is thought to be limited by the availability of iron, increased rates of iron release from these sediments could stimulate productivity and promote greater overall ecosystem change. In this research, a variety of sites across the shelf region will be sampled to accurately evaluate the role of sediments in consuming ecosystem productivity and to estimate the current level of iron release from the sediments. This project will provide a baseline set of sediment results that will present a more complete picture of the west Antarctic shelf ecosystem, will allow for comparison with water column measurements and for evaluation of the fundamental workings of this important ecosystem. This is particularly important since high latitude systems may be vulnerable to the effects of climate fluctuations. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained. Presentations will be made at scientific meetings, at other universities, and at outreach events. A project web site will present key results to the public and explain how this new information improves understanding of Antarctic ecosystems. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Description of Project: <br/>In order to determine the role of sediments within the west Antarctic shelf ecosystem, this project will determine the rates of sediment organic matter oxidation at a variety of sites across the Palmer Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) study region. To estimate the rates of release of iron and manganese from the sediments, these same sites will be sampled for detailed vertical distributions of the concentrations of these metals both in the porewaters and in important mineral phases. Since sediment sampling will be done at LTER sites, the sediment data can be correlated with the rich productivity data set from the LTER. In detail, the project: a) will determine the rates of oxygen consumption, organic carbon oxidation, nutrient release, and iron mobilization by shelf sediments west of the Antarctic Peninsula; b) will investigate the vertical distribution of diagenetic reactions within the sediments; and c) will assess the regional importance of these sediment rates. Sediment cores will be used to determine sediment-water fluxes of dissolved oxygen, total carbon dioxide, nutrients, and the vertical distributions of these dissolved compounds, as well as iron and manganese in the pore waters. Bulk sediment properties of porosity, organic carbon and nitrogen content, carbonate content, biogenic silica content, and multiple species of solid-phase iron, manganese, and sulfur species will also be determined. These measurements will allow determination of total organic carbon oxidation and denitrification rates, and the proportion of aerobic versus anaerobic respiration at each site. Sediment diagenetic modeling will link the processes of organic matter oxidation to metal mobilization. Pore water and solid phase iron and manganese distributions will be used to model iron diagenesis in these sediments and to estimate the iron flux from the sediments to the overlying waters. Finally, the overall regional average and distribution of the sediment processes will be compared with the distributions of seasonally averaged chlorophyll biomass and productivity."

These issues are highly relevant in sparsely populated regions, where wired communications networks are unavailable.  Recent statistical studies have shown a strong annual occurrence trend of ionized patches at ~300-km altitude. Patch occurrences appear to peak in the same months across both the Northern (Arctic) and Southern (Antarctic) polar regions. This is in contrast with established theories that predict a seasonal trend, with patch occurrence peaking in winter months in each hemisphere. While the observed annual trend matches what is predicted and understood in the Arctic, the trend runs completely opposite to what is expected in the Antarctic. There is an urgent need to confirm the Antarctic patch occurrence rates using independent sounding observations, along with observations of the ionospheric electric field behavior from existing ionospheric radars such as SuperDARN. Both types of observations are needed to determine the physical mechanisms that produce these ionized patches. The existing geospace instrumentation deployed at Antarctic stations is not capable of meeting these objectives. <br/><br/>This award will support the development of a low-powered, autonomous ionosonde that would allow oblique sounding measurements of the Antarctic ionosphere between two manned U.S. stations in the Antarctic. The ionosonde's transmitter will be installed at McMurdo and send radio pulses towards South Pole, where the ionosonde's receiver will collect data from this oblique sounding of ionized patches, following their formation, propagation, and dynamics. The 12-months long period of testing this instrument in Antarctica will also allow scientists to collect enough experimental data to potentially deploy an array of ionosonde transmitters at remote Antarctic locations. The various sounding signals will be received and processed at the ionosonde's hub receiver at South Pole."

Geologic samples allow exploration of potential mechanisms for carbon dioxide drawdown during glacial periods through the use of geochemical proxies. Nitrogen and silicon isotope signatures from fossil diatoms (microscopic plants) are used to investigate changes in the physical supply and biological demand for nutrients (like nitrogen and silicon and carbon) in the Southern Ocean. The project will evaluate the use the nitrogen and silicon isotope proxies through a series of laboratory experiments and Southern Ocean field sampling. The results will provide quantification of real relationships between nitrogen and silicon isotopes and nutrient usage in the Southern Ocean and allow exploration of the role of other factors, including biological diversity, ice cover, and mixing, in altering the chemical signatures recorded by diatoms. Seafloor sediment samples will be used to evaluate how well the signal created in the water column is recorded by fossil diatoms buried in the seafloor. Improving the nutrient isotope proxies will allow for a more quantitative understanding of the role of polar biology in regulating natural variation in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The project will also result in the training of a graduate student and development of outreach materials targeting a broad popular audience.<br/><br/>This project seeks to test the fidelity of the diatom nitrogen and silicon isotope proxies, two commonly used paleoceanographic tools for investigating the role of the Southern Ocean biological pump in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations on glacial-interglacial timescales. Existing ground-truthing data, including culture experiments, surface sediment data and downcore reconstructions, all suggest that nutrient utilization is the primary driver of isotopic variation in the Southern Ocean. However, strong contribution of interspecific variation is implied by recent culture results. Moreover, field and laboratory studies present some contradictory results in terms of the relative importance of interspecific variation and of inferred  post-depositional alteration of the nutrient isotope signals. Here, a first order test of the N and Si diatom nutrient isotope paleo-proxies, involving water column dissolved and particulate sampling and laboratory culturing of field-isolates, is proposed. Southern Ocean water, biomass, live diatoms and fossil diatom sampling will be conducted to investigate species and assemblage related variability in diatom nitrogen and silicon isotopes and their relationship to surface nutrient fields and early diagenesis. Access to fresh materials produced in an analogous environmental context to the sediments of primary interest is critical for making robust paleoceanographic reconstructions. Field sampling will occur along 175W, transecting the Antarctic Circumpolar Current from the subtropics to the marginal ice edge. Collection of water, sinking/suspended particles and multi-core samples from 13 stations and 3 shipboard incubation experiments will be used to test four proposed hypotheses that together evaluate the significance of existing culture results and seek to allow the best use of diatom nutrient isotope proxies in evaluating the biological pump."

This is the first modern opportunity for such a comprehensive study of the yearly depositional flux of trace elements (TEs) into the Arctic ocean/ice ecosystem. The combination of 7-Be and aerosol TE measurements has been shown to be an effective tool for estimating the atmospheric input of TEs in remote ocean regions where nearby land-based collection sites do not exist. The data generated in this work will be available to allow ground-truthing of models of aerosol deposition and atmospheric input of TEs. Atmospheric deposition is the dominant pathway by which anthropogenically-derived trace elements, especially mercury (Hg), enter the Arctic Ocean, and recent literature suggests that atmospheric deposition of biologically-essential trace elements such as iron (Fe) could play a major role in controlling biological productivity in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Atmospheric transport and deposition of aerosols is an important delivery mechanism of natural and contaminant trace elements (TEs) to the Arctic. Existing data show that atmospheric deposition of contaminant elements like Hg, Pb, and Se may be a major input of these elements to the Arctic, with likely sources being anthropogenic - industrial or power plant emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion in Europe, Russia, and Asia. The atmospheric input of biologically-essential trace elements (e.g. Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) plays a key role in controlling biogeochemical processes in the ocean, and recent work suggests this might be true in the Arctic as well. These inputs have strong implications for the ecosystem, and even human health. Assessment of this input is difficult because measurements of deposition rates in remote ocean regions are scarce, and are particularly daunting to take in the Arctic because harsh conditions and limited research platforms make it difficult to obtain quality-controlled precipitation and aerosol chemistry measurements on a routine basis. This research will provide estimates of the yearly atmospheric deposition flux of aerosol TEs (total and soluble), including those of biogeochemical importance as well as pollutant species. The seasonal evolution of partitioning of trace element deposition among the various catchments (ice, water, snow, melt ponds) will also be assessed. The work will involve measurements of 7-Be inventories, 7-Be aerosol activities, and aerosol concentrations of TEs. Field work will be during a year-long ice drift of the MOSAiC expedition through the central Arctic Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will be a component of the MOSAiC expedition, an international initiative motivated by the rapidly evolving Arctic climate system, with thinning sea ice, warming ocean and atmosphere temperatures, strong climate feedbacks, and dramatic implications for society. MOSAiC has broad international support and has been endorsed by international and US institutions as a project that is critically needed to provide foundational information on the changing central Arctic system required to support coupled model development. The ability to provide estimates of the atmospheric input of relevant TEs to the Arctic Ocean will contribute widely to the field of chemical oceanography, including understanding anthropogenic impacts on the region and the role atmospheric input of TEs plays in Arctic Ocean ecology. The lead institution is one of the country's leading minority serving universities, and the lead researcher has undertaken a mentoring program for students involved in its research activities. The team will record short lectures and video logs that can be used in future iterations of his courses to introduce important oceanographic concepts and give his students a first-hand account of life aboard an oceanographic vessel. Other scientists will be asked to grant interviews to add to the breadth of perspectives, and the outreach will emphasize the role of basic scientific research in improving our understanding of natural phenomena and the planet's response to anthropogenic stressors."

However, the consequences of this extreme thermal sensitivity for the energetics, development, and survival of developing embryos is not well understood.  This award will investigate the effect of temperature on the metabolism, growth rate, developmental rate, and developmental energetics of embryos and larvae of Antarctic marine ectotherms.  The project will also measure annual variation in temperature and oxygen at different sites in McMurdo Sound, and compare embryonic and larval metabolism in winter and summer to determine the extent to which these life stages can acclimate to seasonal shifts.  This research will provide insight into the ability of polar marine animals and ecosystems to withstand warming polar ocean conditions.<br/><br/>Antarctic marine ectotherms exhibit universally slow growth, low metabolic rates, and extended development, yet many of their rate processes related to physiology and metabolism are highly thermally sensitive.  This suggests that small changes in temperature may result in dramatic changes to energy metabolism, growth, and the rate and duration of development.  This project will measure the effects of temperature on metabolism, developmental rate, and the energetic cost of development of four common and ecologically important species of benthic Antarctic marine invertebrates.  These effects will be measured over the functional ranges of the organisms and in the context of environmentally relevant seasonal shifts in temperature around McMurdo Sound.  Recent data show that seasonal warming of ~1 deg C near McMurdo Station is accompanied by long-lasting hyperoxic events that impact the benthos in the nearshore boundary layer.  This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of both annual variation in environmental oxygen and temperature across the Sound, and whether this variation drives changes in developmental rate and energetics that are consistent with physiological acclimatization.  These data will provide key information about potential impacts of warming Antarctic ectotherms.  In addition, this project will support undergraduate and graduate research and partner with large-enrollment undergraduate courses and REU programs at an ANNH and AANAPISI Title III minority-serving institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They come from both natural sources like volcanoes, dust storms, and forest fires, and from man-made sources like   industry, power plants and vehicles. Since a signature of their origin is imbedded in their composition, they can be tracked back to sources even thousands of miles away using meteorological models. Understanding the composition and sources of these fine particles is critical to developing better models of global climate change, but requires many years of observation.  One of the best places to measure these fine particles in the atmosphere is at the Greenland Summit research station because the site is not near populated areas or the ocean which are sources of these particles. This renewal of an Arctic Observing Network project will extend sampling of these fine particles at the Greenland Summit site another 5 years. The results will be of value to molders of global climate change and to atmospheric scientists. Undergraduate students will be involved in sample analysis. <br/>This program is unique in that the Greenland Summit site is the only high elevation Arctic site and thus responds to aerosols in the free troposphere, the region of the atmosphere that dominates long range transport. Since 2003, aerosols have been collected continuously in 8 size modes, 15 m to 0.09 m, on slowly rotating drums that allow for 12 hr. time resolution and an excellent match to the various transport patterns that bring aerosols into the Arctic.  Since there is very little mass to analyze, the large synchrotron x-ray source at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Advanced Light Source has been used to make the compositional analyses, yielding the lowest values of many aerosol species ever measured in the ambient atmosphere. The new program has several enhancements. Optical back scattering will allow measurement of the global albedo, important since aerosols are roughly 2/3 of the total uncertainty in global climate models. A new method has been added for measuring aerosol organic matter that will allow mass closure. In this protocol, the sum of all species equals the total mass present in each of the 8 size modes so that all aerosol mass can be accounted for in determination of the optical properties The higher energy beams at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source will now also be included, allowing the program to access heavier elements to better identify industrial sources.  These data will be compared with other high elevation sites like the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii to better track long-range transport of aerosols in the Northern hemisphere. A further benefit of these data is that they allow a measurement of how airborne particles get imbedded in the snow pack and eventually the ice cores collected at the Summit site. Thus, these measurements help explain the dust present over the past millennia, during both warm periods and ice ages."

We will continue measuring time series of temperature, salinity, currents, geochemical tracers, sea ice draft, and sea level using bottom-anchored moorings and shipboard measurements. BGOS moorings plus two Japanese moorings (at no cost to this project) will acquire precise data on the variations of the vertical distribution of seawater properties, bottom pressures, sea ice draft and surface waves (during open water conditions) at scientifically important sites within the BG system. Ship-based synoptic sampling covering the Beaufort Gyre will continue to be performed each summer in collaboration with scientists in Canada and Japan, with shared logistics expenses, to augment the year-round mooring measurements. Temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, barium, and 18O will continue to be measured and analyzed at standard locations along sections at 140W, 150W, ~ 75N and ~78N using a shipboard CTD/rosette to continue the long-term time series started in 2003. Samples that provide information on longer time-scales, such as CFCs and carbon tetrachloride, alkalinity, total CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon and tritium/3He, will be collected less frequently. Between CTD/rosette casts, expendable CTDs that profile to 1100 m depth will continue to be used to increase spatial resolution of the temperature and salinity fields.

The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes.  The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography.  The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON.  Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy."

Nearly three-quarters of the Antarctic ice sheet is fringed by regions of floating glacier ice called ice shelves. These ice shelves play an important role in modulating the flow of ice from the ice sheet interior towards the coast, similar to how dams regulate the downstream flow of water from reservoirs. Therefore, a reduction in ice shelf size due to changing air and ocean temperatures can have serious implications for the flux of glacier ice reaching the Antarctic coast, and thus, sea level change. Observations of recent ocean warming in the Amundsen Sea, thinning of the ice shelves, and increased ice flux from the West Antarctic ice sheet interior suggests that ice shelf destabilization triggered by ocean warming may already be underway in some regions. Although detailed observations are available in the Amundsen Sea region, our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in ocean conditions and their influence on ice shelf stability is limited by the scarceness of observations spanning the ice sheet periphery. The project will yield insights into variability in the submarine melting of ice shelves and will help advance the career of a female early-career scientist in a male-dominated field.<br/><br/>The project will use repeat, very high-resolution (~0.5 m pixel width and length) satellite images acquired by the WorldView satellites, to estimate rates of iceberg melting in key coastal regions around Antarctica. The satellite images will be used to construct maps of iceberg surface elevation, which will be differenced in time to derive time series of iceberg volume change and area-averaged melt rates. Where ocean data are available, the melt rates will be compared to these data to assess whether variations in ocean temperature can explain observed iceberg melt variability. Large spatial gradients in melt rates will be compared to estimates of iceberg drift rates, which will be inferred from the repeat satellite images as well as numerically modeled drift rates produced by (unfunded) collaborators, to quantify the effects of water shear on iceberg melt rates. Spatial and temporal patterns in iceberg melting will also be compared to independently derived ice shelf thickness datasets. Overall, the analysis should yield insights into the effects of changes in ocean forcing on the submarine melting of Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs. The project does not require field work in Antarctica."

These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round.  A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project, at the interface of the the fields of glaciology and oceanography, provides support for an early-career principal investigator (PI) (Amundson) from a predominantly undergraduate institution (University of Alaska Southeast) and an additional early career PI at University of Oregon.  More mature PIs at Oregon State University and University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will mentor the younger team members, promoting workforce development.  Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.

This is the first modern opportunity for such a comprehensive study of the yearly depositional flux of trace elements (TEs) into the Arctic ocean/ice ecosystem. The combination of 7-Be and aerosol TE measurements has been shown to be an effective tool for estimating the atmospheric input of TEs in remote ocean regions where nearby land-based collection sites do not exist. The data generated in this work will be available to allow ground-truthing of models of aerosol deposition and atmospheric input of TEs. Atmospheric deposition is the dominant pathway by which anthropogenically-derived trace elements, especially mercury (Hg), enter the Arctic Ocean, and recent literature suggests that atmospheric deposition of biologically-essential trace elements such as iron (Fe) could play a major role in controlling biological productivity in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Atmospheric transport and deposition of aerosols is an important delivery mechanism of natural and contaminant trace elements (TEs) to the Arctic. Existing data show that atmospheric deposition of contaminant elements like Hg, Pb, and Se may be a major input of these elements to the Arctic, with likely sources being anthropogenic - industrial or power plant emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion in Europe, Russia, and Asia. The atmospheric input of biologically-essential trace elements (e.g. Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) plays a key role in controlling biogeochemical processes in the ocean, and recent work suggests this might be true in the Arctic as well. These inputs have strong implications for the ecosystem, and even human health. Assessment of this input is difficult because measurements of deposition rates in remote ocean regions are scarce, and are particularly daunting to take in the Arctic because harsh conditions and limited research platforms make it difficult to obtain quality-controlled precipitation and aerosol chemistry measurements on a routine basis. This research will provide estimates of the yearly atmospheric deposition flux of aerosol TEs (total and soluble), including those of biogeochemical importance as well as pollutant species. The seasonal evolution of partitioning of trace element deposition among the various catchments (ice, water, snow, melt ponds) will also be assessed. The work will involve measurements of 7-Be inventories, 7-Be aerosol activities, and aerosol concentrations of TEs. Field work will be during a year-long ice drift of the MOSAiC expedition through the central Arctic Ocean.<br/><br/>This project will be a component of the MOSAiC expedition, an international initiative motivated by the rapidly evolving Arctic climate system, with thinning sea ice, warming ocean and atmosphere temperatures, strong climate feedbacks, and dramatic implications for society. MOSAiC has broad international support and has been endorsed by international and US institutions as a project that is critically needed to provide foundational information on the changing central Arctic system required to support coupled model development. The ability to provide estimates of the atmospheric input of relevant TEs to the Arctic Ocean will contribute widely to the field of chemical oceanography, including understanding anthropogenic impacts on the region and the role atmospheric input of TEs plays in Arctic Ocean ecology. The lead institution is one of the country's leading minority serving universities, and the lead researcher has undertaken a mentoring program for students involved in its research activities. The team will record short lectures and video logs that can be used in future iterations of his courses to introduce important oceanographic concepts and give his students a first-hand account of life aboard an oceanographic vessel. Other scientists will be asked to grant interviews to add to the breadth of perspectives, and the outreach will emphasize the role of basic scientific research in improving our understanding of natural phenomena and the planet's response to anthropogenic stressors."

An important step in mitigating volcanic hazards is understanding the variables that influence the explosivity of eruptions. The rate at which a magma ascends from the reservoir within the Earth to the surface is one such variable. However, magma ascent rates are particularly difficult to determine because of the lack of reliable methods for investigating the process. This research applies a new approach to study magma storage depths and ascent rates at the Erebus volcanic province of Antarctica, one of Earth's largest alkaline volcanic centers. Small pockets of magma that become trapped within growing olivine crystals are called melt inclusions. The concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in these melt inclusions preserve information on the depth of magma reservoirs.  Changes to the concentration and isotopic composition of water in the inclusions provide information on how long it took for the host magma to rise to the surface. In combination, these data from samples of olivine-rich volcanic deposits in the Erebus volcanic province will be used to determine the depths at which magmas are stored and their ascent rates. The project results will provide a framework for understanding volcanic hazards associated with alkaline volcanism worldwide.  In addition, this project facilitates collaboration among three institutions, and provides an important educational opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Technical project description<br/><br/>The depths at which magmas are stored, their pre-eruptive volatile contents, and the rates at which they ascend to the Earth's surface are important controls on the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. Basaltic magmas are likely to be vapor undersaturated as they begin their ascent from the mantle through the crust, but volatile solubility drops with decreasing pressure. Once vapor saturation is achieved and the magma begins to degas, its pre-eruptive volatile content is determined largely by the depth at which it resides within the crust. Magma stored in deeper reservoirs tend to experience less pre-eruptive degassing and to be richer in volatiles than magma shallower reservoirs. Eruptive style is influenced by the rate at which a magma ascends from the reservoir to the surface through its effect on the efficiency of vapor bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence. The proposed work will advance our understanding of pre-eruptive storage conditions and syn-eruptive ascent rates through a combined field and analytical research program. Volatile measurements from olivine-hosted melt inclusions will be used to systematically investigate magma storage depths and ascent rates associated with alkaline volcanism in the Erebus volcanic province.  A central goal of the project is to provide a spatial and temporal framework for interpreting results from studies of present-day volcanic processes at Mt Erebus volcano.  The Erebus volcanic province of Antarctica is especially well suited to this type of investigation because: (1) there are many exposed mafic scoria cones, fissure vents, and hyaloclastites (exposed in sea cliffs) that produced rapidly quenched, olivine-rich tephra; (2) existing volatile data for Ross Island MIs show that magma storage was relatively deep compared to many mafic volcanic systems; (3) some of the eruptive centers ejected mantle xenoliths, allowing for comparison of ascent rates for xenolith-bearing and xenolith-free eruptions, and comparison of ascent rates for those bearing xenoliths with times estimated from settling velocities; and (4) the cold, dry conditions in Antarctica result in excellent tephra preservation compared to tropical and even many temperate localities. The project provides new tools for assessing volcanic hazards, facilitates collaboration involving researchers from three different institutions (WHOI, U Wyoming, and U Oregon), supports the researchers' involvement in teaching, advising, and outreach, and provides an educational opportunity for a promising young postdoctoral researcher. Understanding the interrelationships among magma volatile contents, reservoir depths, and ascent rates is vital for assessing volcanic hazards associated with alkaline volcanism across the globe."

In the face of accelerated ice sheet contribution to sea level rise, it remains uncertain how the GrIS will adjust to a warming Arctic, declining sea ice and related changing precipitation patterns. This is a concern, given that future sea level rise is strongly dependent on the GrIS response to arctic change. The scientific community is currently undecided between a model of a dynamic GrIS that becomes greatly reduced during warm periods and a model where it is relatively stable, even through periods warmer than today. This proposal addresses the idea that increased arctic precipitation offsets GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperature. The researchers will test this by contributing significant new information on arctic system change and related GrIS dynamics during past and ongoing warm periods, and employing an ice sheet modeling effort synthesizing all new data aimed at both past and future GrIS simulations. The researchers explicitly combine multiple scientific disciplines to provide a better understanding of how key arctic system components such as precipitation, temperature, sea-ice cover and GrIS mass balance are interconnected. The results will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise.<br/><br/>This project will train six graduate students and one post-doctoral researcher. The cross-cutting research program is paralleled by the scope of the outreach plan, to develop a variety of deliverables, including development of an iBook and public outreach events. In addition the team will participate in public outreach events in Buffalo and New York City,  where the public and scientists interact in a casual setting. Finally, this work has synergies with ongoing missions at NASA and other programs within the NSF.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Due to recent advances in numerical ice sheet models and new sub-ice topography of Greenland, combined with finely-tuned field approaches and geochronologic techniques, the time is ripe for a coordinated, cross-disciplinary effort focusing on cryosphere variability in a warming Arctic; the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and sea ice constitute the largest, and most critical components of the arctic cryosphere. The hypothesis that increased arctic precipitation can counterbalance GrIS mass loss during times of elevated temperatures stems from recent findings suggesting that it may be more stable than expected during interglacials. The researchers will: generate new GrIS margin reconstructions during and since the mid-Holocene Thermal Maximum (9,000 to 5,000 years ago), with a powerful approach that combines lake sediment stratigraphy with new sub-ice topography and novel high-sensitivity cosmogenic isotope methods; develop new Holocene climate reconstructions of moisture, temperature and sea ice conditions from lake and ocean sediments and an advanced synthesis of existing arctic ice core and other paleoclimate data; and employ state-of-the-art numerical ice sheet modeling fueled by ice margin and climate reconstructions to test a range of climatic and dynamic controls on GrIS change. If the idea is supported, then it would suggest a relatively stable GrIS during warm periods. If, however, this project provides evidence that the GrIS retreated considerably during the warmer-than-present mid-Holocene and in turn, that the GrIS has reacted more sensitively to temperature than to precipitation change, the results would support a tightly coupled ice sheet size-temperature link and in turn, a much greater near-term GrIS contribution to sea level rise. Either result will be of fundamental relevance to the fates of the arctic system, the GrIS and global sea level rise."

It is driven by poorly understood processes occurring at the ice-ocean interface, such as subglacial discharge into the ocean, turbulent plume dynamics, submarine melting, and iceberg calving. These processes are (1) inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in both glaciology and oceanography and (2) difficult to observe, requiring innovative field techniques and careful site selection. This project will address the relationship between subglacial discharge, turbulent plume dynamics, and submarine melting through a comprehensive field campaign at LeConte Glacier, Alaska, supplemented by a state-of-the-art modeling effort. The field site is ideal because it spans a wide range of forcings on daily to seasonal time scales and because the near-terminus fjord environment is accessible year round.  A successful project will provide a unique data set and improved models for projecting contributions to future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project, at the interface of the the fields of glaciology and oceanography, provides support for an early-career principal investigator (PI) (Amundson) from a predominantly undergraduate institution (University of Alaska Southeast) and an additional early career PI at University of Oregon.  More mature PIs at Oregon State University and University of Alaska Fairbanks Campus will mentor the younger team members, promoting workforce development.  Additional workforce development will be promoted through interaction with high school students and at the participating universities.  The team of PIs will entrain select students from a local Alaska high school to participate in aspects of the field work and engage with the school to integrate their observations into the curriculum.  The project will also provide support for the training two graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The associated mentoring plan is very good.  Outreach to the general public will be enhanced by leveraging the PIs? home institutions? activities.  The PIs will continue established interactions with the National Park Service and the US Forest Service.  These include public lectures, as well as training for interpretive rangers who can reach a broad cross-cut of the public.  Finally, they will develop a brochure concerning their work to further enhance their public outreach.<br/><br/>This project will develop a parameterization of a plume, driven by subglacial discharge, as it interacts with the face of a marine-terminating glacier.  This is a goal that has been endorsed by the international community.  It will be accomplished by conducting three intensive field campaigns to<br/>i. sample the upwelling plume directly with manned and autonomous vessels,<br/>ii. measure the downstream impact of the plume on near-terminus fjord circulation,<br/>iii. determine subglacial discharge and submarine melt rates, and<br/>iv. survey associated changes in glacier terminus dynamics.<br/>Subglacial discharge and ambient water properties in the proglacial fjord will be monitored throughout the project in order to provide<br/>i. important context for the intensive field campaigns, and<br/>ii. a range of parameter space to be explored by a turbulence-resolving hydrodynamic plume model.<br/>Data from the intensive field campaigns will be used to validate the plume model, which will then be used to explore the wider range of parameter space that is provided by long-term measurements.

A significant contribution during the past decades has been from mountain glaciers, but the contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet is anticipated to become dominant in the near future.  This contribution is delivered to the ocean as both meltwater and icebergs that melt in the fjords and coastal ocean around Greenland.  These contributions vary spatially.

Past studies have shown that most Antarctic notothenioids produce special antifreeze proteins that prevent the growth of ice crystals that enter the body. While these proteins help prevent individuals from being killed by growing ice crystals, it is unclear how these fish avoid the accumulation of these small ice crystals inside their tissues over time. This project will observe how ice crystal accumulation relates to the harshness of the fish's habitat and the fish's behavior within different habitats of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The researchers will collect fishes and ocean observations at different field sites that cover a range of habitat severity in terms of temperature and iciness. Researchers will install an underwater ocean observatory near McMurdo Station which will include a HD video camera and hydrophone. The observatory will allow continuous monitoring of ocean conditions and fish behavior that will help explain the conditions and behaviors that contribute to the acquisition and accrual of ice inside the body. Acoustic and video data from the observatory will be available to other scientists and to the public. The project will advance understanding of the many challenges life faces in extreme cold environments. This work continues a line of inquiry that has resulted in the discovery of potential medical and food preservation applications. <br/><br/>Hundreds of antifreeze protein (AFP) structure-function studies have been conducted in the laboratory, providing a basic physical understanding of the AFP-ice interaction. How AFPs function within fishes and their range of environments, however, is far from clear. This project will provide an understanding of notothenioid's freezing avoidance mechanisms, and strategies by quantifying the acquisition, accumulation, and loss of internal ice crystals. Specifically, the goal is to determine if and how habitat severity (as defined by iciness, seawater temperature, and prevalence of supercooled water) and fish behavior influence the abundance of ice crystals in their tissues. Four locations in the McMurdo Sound with different levels of habitat severity will be sampled for oceanographic conditions and ice crystal count within fish tissues. Researchers will use a new technique to count the number of splenic ice crystals, expanding on and simplifying previous methods. Environmental data loggers will be deployed for the duration of the project at the four sites to provide context and real-time assessment of environmental conditions. An oceanographic observatory near McMurdo Station will provide year-round, real-time and archival records of oceanographic conditions, in situ video observations of anchor ice growth and ice-organism interactions, hydroacoustic recordings, and serve as proof-of concept for expanding scientific infrastructure in McMurdo Sound related to monitoring of supercooled waters and oceanographic information."

The presence (or absence) is important for a variety of activities, including shipping, energy exploration and hunting by native populations.  Therefore, forecasting the presence of ice at shorter timescales is critically needed.  Sea ice additionally has a controlling influence on climate by acting as a bright surface capable of reflecting sunlight back to space, thereby highlighting a need to accurately forecast it on decadal time scales.  A significant source of errors in forecasts at all scales is the ability to predict to what extent mixing of the upper ocean occurs and how this mixing helps to eliminate gradients in temperature and salinity that might change the rate of ice formation or melt.  An important item to understand is to what extent atmospheric winds, which we generally forecast relatively well, contribute to this upper-oceanic mixing through the transfer of energy between the atmosphere and ocean.  This project will support the collection of key measurements necessary to help inform the improvement of weather and climate models to support prediction of sea ice at a variety of time scales. <br/><br/>In this study, an unmanned aircraft system will be deployed to provide measurements of atmospheric temperature, winds and humidity.  This information will be used together with information from surface buoys and ice imagery to understand atmosphere-ocean energy transfer during the fall freeze-up period.  Specifically, this work will help to address questions related to the role of the presence of sea ice in energy transfer and how that role is simulated in numerical models, the extent to which mechanisms supporting transfer vary at small spatial scales and how those are handled in today?s state of the art modeling tools, and the importance of vertical resolution of models in accurately capturing this energy transfer.  Measurements will be compared to high-resolution models that couple the atmosphere, ice and ocean together into single simulations.  Flights will take place from northern Alaska in September and October of 2018 and will interface with a broader effort (the Stratified Ocean Dynamics of the Arctic, or SODA, project) to understand the upper ocean in this part of the world.

Antarctic krill also constitute a target species for industrial fisheries in the Southern Ocean. The success of Antarctic krill populations is largely determined by the ability of their young to survive the long, dark winter, where food is extremely scarce. To survive the long-dark winter, young Antarctic krill must have a high-quality diet in autumn. However, warming in certain parts of Antarctica is changing the dynamics and quality of the polar food web, resulting in a shift in the type of food available to young krill in autumn. It is not yet clear how these dynamic changes are affecting the ability of krill to survive the winter. This project aims to fill an important gap in current knowledge on an understudied stage of the Antarctic krill life cycle, the 1-year old juveniles. The results derived from this work will contribute to the development of improved bioenergetic, population and ecosystem models, and will advance current scientific understanding of this critical Antarctic species. This CAREER project's core education and outreach objectives seek to enhance education and increase diversity within STEM fields. An undergraduate course will be developed that will integrate undergraduate research and writing in way that promotes authentic scientific inquiry and analysis of original research data by the students, and that enhances their communication skills. A graduate course will be developed that will promote students' skills in communicating their own research to a non-scientific audience.  Graduate students will be supported through the proposed study and will gain valuable research experience. Traditionally underserved undergraduate students will be recruited to conduct independent research under the umbrella of the larger project. Throughout each field season, the research team will maintain a weekly blog that will include short videos, photographs and text highlighting the research, as well as their experiences living and working in Antarctica. The aim of the blog will be to engage the public and increase awareness and understanding of Antarctic ecosystems and the impact of warming, and of the scientific process of research and discovery.<br/><br/>In this 5-year CAREER project, the investigator will use a combination of empirical and theoretical techniques to assess the effects of diet on 1-year old krill in autumn-winter. The research is centered on four hypotheses: (H1) autumn diet affects 1-year old krill physiology and condition at the onset of winter; (H2) autumn diet has an effect on winter physiology and condition of 1-year old krill under variable winter food conditions; (H3) the rate of change in physiology and condition of 1-year old krill from autumn to winter is dependent on autumn diet; and (H4) the winter energy budget of 1-year old krill will vary between years and will be dependent on autumn diet. Long-term feeding experiments and in situ sampling will be used to measure changes in the physiology and condition of krill in relation to their diet and feeding environment. Empirically-derived data will be used to develop theoretical models of growth rates and energy budgets to determine how diet will influence the overwinter survival of 1-year old krill. The research will be integrated with an education and outreach plan to (1) develop engaging undergraduate and graduate courses, (2) train and develop young scientists for careers in polar research, and (3) engage the public and increase their awareness and understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mechanical properties of ice depend largely on the temperature and the orientation of the crystals that make up the ice.  The most accurate method for measuring ice crystal orientation and temperature is through drilling and direct analysis of an ice core.  However, this method is very costly, time-consuming, and limited in spatial coverage.  Geophysical techniques, such as seismic and radar, can cover much more area, but we have little knowledge about the practical limitations of these techniques as they relate to calculating mechanical properties.  This project addresses that knowledge gap through construction of a computational toolbox that will allow accurate assessment of the ability of geophysical surveys to image crystal orientation and ice temperature.  Researchers can then use these tools to adjust the field survey plans to maximize the return on investment.  By working to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future geophysical work related to glacial flow, this proposal will improve scientists? ability to quantify sea-level variations within the larger context of climate change.  The project includes building new user-friendly, publicly accessible software and instructional modules.  The work will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, who will play a role in research and develop instructional materials. <br/><br/>Ice viscosity, the resistance of ice to flow, exerts significant control over ice velocity.  Therefore, mapping ice viscosity is important for understanding the current and future behavior of glaciers and ice sheets.  To do so, scientists must determine the temperature and crystal orientation fabric throughout the ice. Seismic and radar techniques can survey large areas quickly, and thus are promising, yet not fully tested, methods to efficiently measure the thermal and mechanical structure of flowing ice.  As part of this project, scientists will develop and use a computational framework to quantify the degree to which seismic and radar techniques can resolve the crystal orientation fabric and temperature of streaming ice, and then test how sensitive ice flow is to the attendant uncertainty.  To meet these goals, a numerical toolbox will be built which will allow the glacier/ice stream geometry and physical properties (temperature, crystal orientation fabric, density and acidity) to be varied. The toolbox will be capable of both creating synthetic radar and seismic profiles through forward modeling and inverting synthetic profiles to allow evaluation of how well geophysical techniques can image the original thermal and mechanical structure. These simulated radar and seismic data will allow scientists to better quantify the influence of the variability in mechanical properties of the ice on flow velocities and patterns.  The results of this work will guide planning for future field campaigns, making them more effective and efficient. This project does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic."

From a single location, these devices can scan the environments and observe polar atmosphere and ionosphere at the 80-200 km altitude within a wide sector covering thousands of square miles.

An important step in mitigating volcanic hazards is understanding the variables that influence the explosivity of eruptions. The rate at which a magma ascends from the reservoir within the Earth to the surface is one such variable. However, magma ascent rates are particularly difficult to determine because of the lack of reliable methods for investigating the process. This research applies a new approach to study magma storage depths and ascent rates at the Erebus volcanic province of Antarctica, one of Earth's largest alkaline volcanic centers. Small pockets of magma that become trapped within growing olivine crystals are called melt inclusions. The concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in these melt inclusions preserve information on the depth of magma reservoirs.  Changes to the concentration and isotopic composition of water in the inclusions provide information on how long it took for the host magma to rise to the surface. In combination, these data from samples of olivine-rich volcanic deposits in the Erebus volcanic province will be used to determine the depths at which magmas are stored and their ascent rates. The project results will provide a framework for understanding volcanic hazards associated with alkaline volcanism worldwide.  In addition, this project facilitates collaboration among three institutions, and provides an important educational opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Technical project description<br/><br/>The depths at which magmas are stored, their pre-eruptive volatile contents, and the rates at which they ascend to the Earth's surface are important controls on the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. Basaltic magmas are likely to be vapor undersaturated as they begin their ascent from the mantle through the crust, but volatile solubility drops with decreasing pressure. Once vapor saturation is achieved and the magma begins to degas, its pre-eruptive volatile content is determined largely by the depth at which it resides within the crust. Magma stored in deeper reservoirs tend to experience less pre-eruptive degassing and to be richer in volatiles than magma shallower reservoirs. Eruptive style is influenced by the rate at which a magma ascends from the reservoir to the surface through its effect on the efficiency of vapor bubble nucleation, growth, and coalescence. The proposed work will advance our understanding of pre-eruptive storage conditions and syn-eruptive ascent rates through a combined field and analytical research program. Volatile measurements from olivine-hosted melt inclusions will be used to systematically investigate magma storage depths and ascent rates associated with alkaline volcanism in the Erebus volcanic province.  A central goal of the project is to provide a spatial and temporal framework for interpreting results from studies of present-day volcanic processes at Mt Erebus volcano.  The Erebus volcanic province of Antarctica is especially well suited to this type of investigation because: (1) there are many exposed mafic scoria cones, fissure vents, and hyaloclastites (exposed in sea cliffs) that produced rapidly quenched, olivine-rich tephra; (2) existing volatile data for Ross Island MIs show that magma storage was relatively deep compared to many mafic volcanic systems; (3) some of the eruptive centers ejected mantle xenoliths, allowing for comparison of ascent rates for xenolith-bearing and xenolith-free eruptions, and comparison of ascent rates for those bearing xenoliths with times estimated from settling velocities; and (4) the cold, dry conditions in Antarctica result in excellent tephra preservation compared to tropical and even many temperate localities. The project provides new tools for assessing volcanic hazards, facilitates collaboration involving researchers from three different institutions (WHOI, U Wyoming, and U Oregon), supports the researchers' involvement in teaching, advising, and outreach, and provides an educational opportunity for a promising young postdoctoral researcher. Understanding the interrelationships among magma volatile contents, reservoir depths, and ascent rates is vital for assessing volcanic hazards associated with alkaline volcanism across the globe."

Providing a better understanding of the interactions between aerosols and clouds is of direct societal value because of their ultimate impact on the GrIS mass and energy budgets. Since 2010 ICECAPS has significantly advanced understanding of cloud properties, radiation and surface energy, and precipitation processes over the GrIS, while also supporting process-based model evaluation, development of new measurement techniques, ground comparisons for multiple satellite measurements and aircraft missions, and operational radiosonde data for weather forecast models. The new ICECAPS-ACE will provide insight into the role that advective aerosol sources play in cloud and precipitation processes. The addition of the aerosol measurements will allow, for the first time, an investigation of how aerosols impact the surface energy and mass budgets of the central GrIS. Because of the importance of the GrIS to the Arctic, the ICECAPS project has been endorsed as a YOPP activity and will archive high-resolution data to be used for physical process-based model evaluation and verification that will focus on the surface energy budget, precipitation, and cloud-aerosol interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This change permanently altered the future of life on Earth, yet little is known about the evolutionary processes leading to it. The Melainabacteria were first discovered in 2013 and are closely related non-photosynthetic relatives of the first group of organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis.  This project will utilize existing data on metagenomes from microbial mats in Lake Vanda, an ice-covered lake in Antarctica where many sequences of Melainabacteria have been previously identified.      From this genetic information, the project aims to assess the metabolic capabilities of these Melainabacteria and identify their potential ecological roles.  The project will additionally evaluate the evolutionary relationships among the Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria and closely related organisms that will allow an advancement in understanding of the evolutionary path that lead to oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth.<br/> <br/> <br/>The project will focus on extracting evolutionary information from the genomic data of Melainabacteria and Sericytochromatia, recently-described groups closely related to but basal to the Cyanobacteria. The characterization of novel members of these groups in samples from Lake Vanda, Antarctica, will provide insights into the path and processes involved in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. The research will focus on assessing the metabolic capabilities of Melainabacteri, deriving the evolutionary relationships among Melainabacteria and Cyanobacteria and reconstructing potential evolutionary pathways leading to oxygenic photosynthesis.  The project will focus on 12 metagenomes where the researchers expect to obtain genomes for at least the eight most abundant Melainabacteria in the dataset. Melainabacteria bins will be annotated and preliminary metabolic pathways will be constructed. The project will utilize full-length sequences of marker genes from across the bacterial domain with a particular focus on taxa that are oxygenic or anoxygenic phototrophs and use the marker genes, to build a rooted ""backbone"" tree. Incomplete or short sequences from the metagenomes will be added to the tree using the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm. The researchers will also build a corresponding phylogenetic tree using a Bayesian framework and compare their topologies.  By doing so, the project aims to improve the understanding of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which caused the most significant change in Earth's surface chemistry. Specifically, they will document a significantly broader metabolic diversity within the Melainabacteria than has been previously identified, gain significant insights into their metabolic evolution, their evolutionary relationships with the Cyanobacteria, and the evolutionary steps leading to the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. This research will have the overall effect of constraining key evolutionary processes in the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. It will provide the foundation for future studies by indicating where a genomic record of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis may be preserved. Results will also be shared with middle school children through the development of scientific lesson plans in collaboration with teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of the 22 species that are currently recognized, all are considered at least Threatened or Near-Threatened, and 9 are listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered. Because of the decline in albatross populations and the birds' role as a top predator in the pelagic ecosystem, it is vitally important to understand the factors affecting the population dynamics of these birds to better inform strategies for conservation and mitigating environmental change. The goal of this project is to answer the question: What are the population consequences of albatross bioenergetics and foraging strategies? The investigators will take a two pronged approach: 1) constructing, parameterizing, and validating an Individual Based Model (IBM) that rests on Dynamic Energy Budget theory and state dependent foraging theory; and 2) undertaking an in-depth meta-analysis of existing individual tracking and life history data from multiple albatross species across successive life stages. This theoretical work will be grounded with a unique and extensive data set on albatrosses provided by collaborator Richard Phillips from the British Antarctic Survey. The IBM approach will incorporate details such as adult energetic state, chick needs and energetics, reproductive stage, and spatial and temporal variation in prey availability within a single framework. This facilitates exploration of emergent patterns, allowing the investigators to explicitly link behavior, energetic, and population dynamics.<br/><br/>Bioenergetics constrain a variety of behaviors. A more complete understanding of how individuals use energy can give insight into how behaviors from foraging to breeding and survival, and resulting population attributes, might change with environmental factors, due to anthropogenic and other drivers. This work will further a general understanding of how bioenergetics shapes behavior and drives population level processes, while providing an approach that can be used to guide conservation strategies for endangered populations. The research findings and activities will be made accessible to public audiences through websites and on a blog maintained for the project by a postdoctoral researcher. The project will involve undergraduate and high school researchers in the project, within formal laboratory groups and also through in-classroom presentations and activities. This project also involves outreach to local elementary schools, as the albatross-Antarctic bioenergetics system provides a charismatic and tangible teaching tool, for exploring a complex conservation issue, and demonstrating the utility of quantitative biological research approaches. All project publications will be open access, the resulting open source software will be released to the public, and metadata and analyses will be fully documented and made available through the Knowledge Network for Biodiversity, to promote further collaborative exploration of this system."

An enigmatic feature of the WARS is its transition from a broad rift system during its early history, to a narrow rift more recently. Both broad and narrow rifts are common features on Earth. The proposed research leverages the unique behavior of the WARS to examine the factors that determine how and why these styles of rift behavior develop. Computer models will be developed to match the style of extension in the WARS with the space-time patterns of volcanism and magmatism in the rift. These models will constrain temperatures in the crust and mantle beneath the rift, which are thought to exert strong controls on the style of rift behavior, and will test several hypotheses for the causes of rift-related magmatism. The project contributes to advancing basic science through improved understanding of how continents break apart and how continental rifts and rift sedimentary basins evolve. Improved understanding of these processes provides foundational knowledge that informs assessment of volcano, earthquake, and landslide hazards common in modern rift systems such as the broad cordilleran rift in the western U.S. and the narrow East African Rift. Project outcomes will also provide a process-based geological context for exploration of geothermal energy resources in active rifts and fossil energy resources in sedimentary basins formed by ancient rift systems such as those bounding the eastern U.S. and Gulf of Mexico continental margins. Research conducted during this project will become the basis for development of a hands-on science experiment designed to demonstrate rift behaviors for junior high school and high school science classes. Science kits containing materials for the experiment will be created and added to a K-12 science materials ?lending library? maintained by Colorado State University (CSU). K-12 teachers will be trained to use the science kit during summer teacher workshops that are regularly held on the CSU campus. The research will be conducted with help from one Ph.D. student and one undergraduate student, both of whom will also participate in the K-12 teacher?s workshops and development of the classroom science kit.<br/><br/>Technical Project Description<br/><br/>This project will produce new constraints on the thermal evolution of the Earth's mantle beneath the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) since the onset of extension ca. 105 million years ago. This is critical to understanding WARS extension, as contrasting models have argued for active rifting driven by rising hot mantle plumes, and passive rifting driven by intraplate gravitational forces and far-field boundary forces applied at the edges of the tectonic plate. A suite of finite element models will be developed to examine alternative rifting scenarios in order to determine if models with a hot mantle are consistent with the WARS structural evolution. Multiple simulations will be created to identify warmest and coolest rifting scenarios. These warm and cool end-member temperature fields will be used to test the hypothesis that a plume or plumes are responsible for rifting in the WARS. Various petrogenetic models for rift-related magmatism will be tested by computing the potential magma contribution from each hypothetical source using the P-T fields from the end-member models. The project will produce two self-consistent models of rifting and magmatism in the WARS (warm and cool end members), constrained by the dual requirements of matching the structural evolution of the rift and space-time patterns of magma production and composition."

Summit Station hosts the Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), a cooperation between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration with permission from the Danish Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland to provide long-term environmental measurements. Summit is the only high-elevation, free-tropospheric, inland environmental observatory in the Arctic which is manned throughout the year. Summit therefore fills a unique niche in the international scientific community?s global measurement capability. The Science Coordination Office (SCO) for Summit Station and the Greenland Ice Sheet serves in an advisory capacity to NSF?s Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program.  SCO?s primary role is to present the needs and desires of the science community working on the Greenland Ice Sheet in discussions and decision making processes involving NSF, its primary logistics support contractor, and other stakeholders.  The SCO also works with NSF, NSF?s contractor, and science teams to work out equitable and efficient use of resources, and strives to ensure that the wide range of science and support activities impact the pristine character of Summit as lightly as possible.  SCO shares in the long-range goal of redeveloping Summit infrastructure in ways that will reduce long-term operation and maintenance costs, and reduce the emissions of pollutants by facilities on the station and the aircraft and traverse vehicles that visit.  The SCO also helps coordinate visits to Summit for educational groups at all levels, from high school to post-graduate. <br/><br/>The SCO will work closely with NSF and all relevant stakeholders in the design of a revitalized Summit Station where reducing operational and maintenance effort (and costs) will preserve the site for future science by reducing emissions. Additional scientific communities, including astronomy and astrophysics, have recently expressed interest in using Summit Station as an Arctic base for new observations.  SCO will actively participate in discussions with all interested parties to develop a site plan to accommodate an influx of additional research activities while maintaining long-standing focus on climate-relevant research which requires clean air and snow conditions.  SCO?s website is a keystone of communication to the science community, with several new features added over the past few years, including; a Google Earth based GIS recording activity in the region over the past 9 years, a virtual tour using Streetview images, a new Working at Summit section that targets new investigators, a comprehensive bibliography of published work near Summit, and a quarterly Newsletter).

While in non-polar regions of the planet the atmosphere cleans itself through photochemistry that involves ozone, the atmosphere above sea-ice covered regions cleans itself at least in part through chemistry involving halogen atoms - chlorine, bromine and iodine.  This halogen chemistry sometimes manifests itself through the very rapid (and very unusual, compared to the rest of the atmosphere) consumption of ozone and elemental mercury, to near-zero levels, in the lower atmosphere. Ozone is a critically important atmospheric constituent that is a powerful cleaning agent, but it is also toxic to plants and to the human respiratory system, and is a regulated air pollutant. Elemental mercury, when oxidized, can be converted to highly toxic forms, e.g. methyl mercury. Since this polar halogen chemistry is unique, it needs to be understood in terms of its global impact, and in the context of the rapid environmental change occurring in the Arctic.<br/><br/>The grant would fund a collaborative team to conduct measurements of fluxes (i.e. rates of emission) of Cl2, Br2, and I2, from the saline snowpack at Barrow, Alaska. The controlling environmental variables (e.g. sunlight, presence of ozone, pH, salt concentrations, snow composition) that determine the fluxes will be studied using a snow chamber, using a variety of snow and ice samples collected at Barrow, and through direct measurements of the emission from the snowpack near Barrow. The team will then use the measured halogen fluxes and vertical mixing information to constrain a one-dimensional (vertical scale) numerical model to investigate the vertical scale impact of the surface fluxes, and to examine how this might change as the nature of the surface changes with climate change. A significant part of the discovery component of the effort will focus on molecular iodine and iodine chemistry, which has been little-explored in the Arctic to date. The broader impacts are oriented toward the goal of understanding the Arctic in order to inform better prediction of the impacts of change in the Arctic, and of the impact of Arctic change on other parts of the Earth system. A focus of this project will be the education and inspiration of the next generation of scholars, teachers, and researchers about science and the changing planet. Each of the three lead investigators will mentor both undergraduate and graduate students in the course of this project. Students who participate in the field effort at Barrow benefit from a unique experience in conducting experiments in harsh environments, managing science logistics in remote locations, and engaging in science and education partnerships with Arctic people. In partnership with this project an adventure and nature writer, Peter Lourie, will write a new book about sea ice, how scientists study it, why it is important to humans and to the planet, and how it is changing. He will also produce on-line educational material about sea ice and science in the Arctic, aimed at middle-school education. All of the participating scientists will be engaged in a range of outreach activities, including presentations at schools, involvement with ""Portal to the Public"" - a nationwide network of informal science education efforts - and with the active recruitment of underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science and education."

The PRB's mission is to advance understanding of the polar regions, including all areas of science, engineering, human dimensions, and policy; foster application of polar science to benefit the public and decision makers; advise U.S. research programs so they are responsive to the needs of the nation; encourage interdisciplinary and cross polar perspectives; and provide a forum for independent discussion of polar issues. Activities include discussion forums, program reviews, assistance in setting priorities and identifying research opportunities, evaluation of relevant technologies, analyses of controversial and nationally important topics, and other tasks as needed. The Board does not conduct research, but helps to focus and integrate information and thus give polar research more visibility and a broader impact on society, both in the United States and internationally. The PRB also serves as the U.S. National Committee to two international polar science organizations -- the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC).<br/><br/>The PRB's activities bring diverse scientific perspectives together in service to national needs. The PRB strives to enhance understanding of the Arctic and Antarctic, provide independent views on U.S. research efforts, ensure that the polar science community is involved in government decision-making, and grow US leadership in international activities. The Board asks the ""best and brightest"" scientists to volunteer their time, and these volunteers are the intellectual force behind all the Board's work. Participants are selected with care to bring a diversity of expertise and experience; they are broad thinkers who can both react to requests for assistance and look ahead to anticipate issues. The Board is increasingly effective, conducting more visible activities, and has earned a reputation for timely and frank guidance.

Many Antarctic marine organisms have evolved in stable, cold ocean conditions and possess limited ability to respond to environmental fluctuations. To date, research on the physiological limits of Antarctic fishes has focused largely on adult life stages. However, early life stages may be more sensitive to environmental change because they may need to prioritize energy to growth and development instead of maintenance of physiological balance and integrity- even under stress conditions. This project will examine the specific mechanisms that young (embryos, larvae and juveniles) Antarctic fishes use to respond to changes in ocean conditions at the molecular, cellular and physiological levels, so that they are able to survive. The aim is to provide a unifying framework for linking environmental change, gene expression, metabolism and organismal performance in different species that have various rates of growth and development. There is a diverse and robust education and outreach program linked with the research effort that will reach students, teachers, young scientists, community members and government officials at local and regions scales. <br/><br/>Polar species have already been identified as highly vulnerable to global change. However as yet, there is no unifying framework for linking environmental change to organismal performance, in part because a mechanistic understanding of how stressors interact at the molecular, biochemical and physiological level is underdeveloped is lacking for most species. In the marine environment, this paucity of information limits our capacity to accurately predict the impacts of warming and CO2-acidification on polar species, and therefore prevents linking climate model projections to population health predictions. This research will evaluate whether metabolic capacity (i.e. the ability to match energy supply with energy demand) limits the capacity of Antarctic fishes to acclimate to the simultaneous stressors of ocean warming and CO2-acidification. If species are unable to reestablish metabolic homeostasis following exposure to stressors, increased energetic costs may lead to a decline in physiological performance, organismal fitness, and survival. This energy-mismatch hypothesis will be tested in a multi-species approach that focuses on the early life stages, as growing juveniles are likely more vulnerable to energetic constraints than adults, while different species are targeted in order to understand how differences in phenology and life history traits influence metabolic plasticity. The research will provide a mechanistic integration of gene expression and metabolite patterns, and metabolic responses at the cellular and whole organism levels to broadly understand metabolic plasticity of fishes.  The research is aligned with the theme ""Decoding the genomic and transcriptomic bases of biological adaptation and response across Antarctic organisms and ecosystems"" which is one of three major themes identified by the National Academy of Sciences in their document ""A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research"". Additionally, this project builds environmental stewardship and awareness by increasing science literacy in the broader community in three main ways: First it will increase the diversity of students involved in environmental science research by supporting one PhD student, one postdoctoral scholar and two undergraduate students and promoting the training of young students from groups traditionally underrepresented in environmental biology. Second, the project will participate in UC Davis's OneClimate initiative, which leverages the community's expertise to develop broad perspectives regarding climate change, science and society, and engage K-12 students, government officials, and local and statewide communities on topics of Antarctic research, organismal adaptation as well as ongoing and potential future changes at the poles. Lastly, summer workshops will be conducted in collaborations with the NSF-funded education program APPLES (Arctic Plant Phenology: Learning through Engaged Science), to engage teachers and K-12 students in polar science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the Eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) stratified sediment in lakes spanning the current interglacial and the warmer previous interglacial, preserve sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and organic molecules that can be used for reconstruction of past ecosystems and their dependence on temperature and hydroclimate.

Diatom growth fuels the SO food web and balances atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering the carbon used for growth to the deep ocean on long time scales as cells sink below the surface. The diatom growth is limited by the available iron in the seawater, most of which is not freely available to the diatoms but instead is tightly bound to other compounds. The nature of these compounds and how phytoplankton acquire iron from them is critical to understanding productivity in this region and globally. The investigators will conduct experiments to characterize the relationship between diatoms, their associated bacteria, and iron in open ocean and inshore waters. Experiments will involve supplying nutrients at varying nutrient ratios to natural phytoplankton assemblages to determine how diatoms and their associated bacteria respond to different conditions. This will provide valuable data that can be used by climate and food web modelers and it will help us better understand the relationship between iron, a key nutrient in the ocean, and the organisms at the base of the food web that use iron for photosynthetic growth and carbon uptake. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project supports early career senior investigators and the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as outreach activities with middle school Girl Scouts in Rhode Island, inner city middle and high school age girls in Virginia, and middle school girls in Florida.<br/><br/>The project combines trace metal biogeochemistry, phytoplankton cultivation, and molecular biology to address questions regarding the production of iron-binding compounds and the role of diatom-bacterial interactions in this iron-limited region. Iron is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton. Phytoplankton growth in the SO is limited by a lack of sufficient iron, with important consequences for carbon cycling and climate in this high latitude regime. Some of the major outstanding questions in iron biogeochemistry relate to the organic compounds that bind >99.9% of dissolved iron in surface oceans. The investigators' prior research in this region suggests that production of strong iron-binding compounds in the SO is linked to diatom blooms in waters with high nitrate to iron ratios. The sources of these compounds are unknown but the investigators hypothesize that they may be from bacteria, which are known to produce such compounds for their own use. The project will test three hypotheses concerning the production of these iron-binding compounds, limitations on the biological availability of iron even if present in high concentrations, and the roles of diatom-associated bacteria in these processes. Results from this project will provide fundamental information about the biogeochemical trigger, and biological sources and function, of natural strong iron-binding compound production in the SO, where iron plays a critical role in phytoplankton productivity, carbon cycling, and climate regulation."

However, as the arctic warms the ice sheet has been retreating, and as a result, altering the fundamental nature of weathering and the delivery of nutrients and elements to the ocean.  The proposed work is focused on the hydrological, biological, biogeochemical, and the isotopic signatures of proglacial watersheds, which are watershed that convey dilute but high volume glacial meltwater from the top and underneath the ice sheet to the ocean, and deglacial watersheds, which are watersheds that are no longer physically connected to the ice sheet and sourced only by annual precipitation and permafrost melt.  The PIs contend that while deglacial watersheds have received less attention, preliminary work suggests they may be equally or more important than proglacial watersheds for oceanic and atmospheric fluxes.  Moreover, as the ice sheet melts, the area contributing to meltwater and constituent fluxes will increasingly be from deglacial watersheds.  The understanding gained from this work will provide a context for the  prediction of future land-ocean and land-atmosphere fluxes in response to continued ice sheet retreat. <br/><br/>Results of the project have the potential to change our understanding of global CO2, nutrient, and isotope cycling in response to ice sheet collapse and permit predictions of the future responses to global warming and ice sheet retreat.  Results will also provide a context to interpret past high latitude ice sheet retreat and climate change based on marine isotope records.  The project includes training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as a collaboration with students and faculty at a Greenlandic academic institution.<br/><br/>The proposed study will test the hypotheses that (1) deglacial and proglacial watersheds contribute distinct elemental, isotopic, and nutrient fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere as a result of evolving weathering patterns, and (2) these reactions and associated fluxes will change within and between watersheds as the Greenland Ice Sheet retreats. The project focuses on three field areas: deglacial and proglacial watersheds near Kangerlussuaq and Narsasuaq and a deglacial watershed near Sisimiut.  Each area has a distinct water balance, exposure age, and weathering characteristics, and will be sampled three times over two melt seasons to evaluate intra-seasonal and inter-annual variations.  Mass balance models and PHREEQc modeling of solute data will be used to identify and assess extents of weathering reactions. Weathering extents will also be estimated based on trends in proportional contributions of minerals and offsets between dissolved and bedload strontium and lead isotope ratios, and will be linked to phosphorous fluxes and organic carbon lability and degradation. This holistic approach will provide a broad view of the relative elemental, nutrient and isotopic fluxes in proglacial and deglacial environments.  These results will provide magnitudes, time scales, and drivers of weathering reactions, with a goal of linking fluxes to past records and future predictions of global climate change associated with continental ice sheet collapse."

The Antarctic Peninsula is an area of growing importance internationally for scientific research, species and ecosystem conservation, tourism, shipping, and US national interests in Antarctica.  The future melting of ice along the West Antarctic Peninsula is of importance to the regional freshwater budget, ocean circulation, and ecosystems in this biologically active region.  Regional and global projections of sea level rise indicate the West Antarctic Peninsula must be included in decadal scale projections as the contribution to global sea level is at present equal in magnitude to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet component.  This study will examine the role that the ocean is playing presently?and what role it might play in the future?in the melting of ice along the West Antarctic Peninsula.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to understand the impact of the ocean structure and dynamics on the melting of West Antarctic Peninsula glaciers using a combination of high-resolution models and historic data. The project focuses on (i) the importance that shelf circulation processes - driven for example by wind and buoyancy forcing and by the exchange with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and modulated by the complex bottom topography - have on the melting of glaciers, relative to that circulation driven by the melting glacier itself, (ii) the impact of the distinct differences in ocean properties and circulation dynamics along the coast, with particular emphasis in differences between Bransfield Strait and the shelf to the south, and (iii) the competition of wind- and buoyancy-modulated exchange between the open ocean and the shelf and the transport and mixing processes on the shelf in determining the vertical structure of the nearshore thermal forcing, and its impact on glacier melting."

These proteins, called ion channels, open and close to allow ions (atoms or molecules with electrical charge) to flow into or out of cells which causes the electrical activity of nerves and muscles. Mutations that influence this process are the basis of numerous human disorders such as epilepsy, heart arrhythmias, and muscle paralysis. Thus, it is important to understand what parts of the proteins govern these transitions. The speed with which channels open and close depends on temperature. Human ion channels transition slowly when we are cold, which is why we become numb in the cold. Yet Antarctic fish, called icefish, are active at freezing temperatures that drastically limit the activity of human ion channels. The investigators have evidence that specific alterations in the icefishs' ion channels allow their channels to operate differently in the cold and they will use gene discovery and biophysical methods to test how these changes alter the transitions of icefish proteins at different temperatures. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The gene discovery analysis will be done by undergraduate students including those from a minority-serving university and the investigators will develop a new course which will also serve students at that institution and elsewhere. In addition, the investigators will participate in educational outreach events with the general public as well as with groups with special needs.<br/><br/>Notothenioid fishes are one of the most successful groups of vertebrates in Antarctica. Notothens have adaptations to the freezing water they inhabit and this project will study how their voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) function in the cold. The molecular movements of ion channels are severely impaired by cold, yet notothens function at temperatures that would paralyze the nerves and muscles of ""cold-blooded"" temperate zone animals. Surprisingly, no biophysical or molecular investigations have been conducted on notothen VGICs. The investigators have preliminary data that amino acid substitutions occur at sites in VGICs that are evolutionarily conserved from fruit flies to humans. Some of these sites are known to impact channel function and the role of others in channel transitioning are unknown. The results from studying them will provide novel information also applicable to non-notothen, perhaps even human, VGICs as well as providing insights into how VGICs adapt to the cold. The project will biophysically characterize notothen VGICs using voltage-clamp techniques will and compare their properties over a range of temperatures to the same channel from two temperate zone fish. The role of unique notothen amino acid substitutions will be characterized by mutagenesis. One specific aim will be a project in which undergraduates mine notothen sequence databases to identify other potential amino acid substitutions in VGICs that might facilitate adaptation to the cold."

The isotopic composition of diatom-bound organic nitrogen is one of the best hopes for reconstructing the nutrient status of polar surface waters over glacial cycles, which in turn may hold the explanation for the decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide during ice ages. The PIs propose to generate detailed diatom-bound nitrogen isotope (&#948;15Ndb) records from high sedimentation rate cores from the Kerguelen Plateau. Because the cores were collected at relatively shallow seafloor depths, they have adequate planktonic and benthic foraminifera to develop accurate age models. The resulting data could be compared with climate records from Antarctic ice cores and other archives to investigate climate-related changes, including the major steps into and out of ice ages and the millennial-scale events that occur during ice ages and at their ends. The records generated in this project will provide a critical test of hypotheses for the cause of lower ice age CO2.<br/> <br/>Broader impacts:<br/>This study will contribute to the goal of understanding ice ages and past CO2 changes, which both have broad implications for future climate.

A lack of coherent high vertical and temporal resolution observations of cloud particles, aerosols moisture advection (i.e. water vapor) and thermodynamics, creates large uncertainties in current model estimates of cloud properties and inhibits our understanding of cloud radiative and precipitation impacts on the surface. As a result, current weather and climate models poorly parameterize clouds over the Arctic and more specifically over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS). A reduction in this uncertainty is particularly important above the GIS, where clouds act as sinks and sources to the ice mass balance by modulating the surface radiation budget and available precipitable water. To gain the understanding necessary to reduce this uncertainty, a new autonomous multi-wavelength, polarized Raman lidar is proposed for development and deployment at the NSF&#700;s observatory in Summit, Greenland. The new lidar observations will employ multiple wavelengths and polarizations to observe elastic and inelastic scattering from the Arctic atmosphere enabling regular retrieval of temperature, water vapor and extinction profiles. This combination of observational capability will create a coherent dataset of high-resolution thermodynamic, cloud and aerosol observations through the Arctic troposphere and lower stratosphere above Summit. Broadly, this addition to the NSF Observatory at Summit, Greenland as part of the larger Arctic Observing Network fits well within the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) implementation plan. Thus, this instrument will significantly enhance Arctic observing infrastructure and advance observations and understanding of change in the Arctic. The proposed instrumentation and observations are the first of their kind on the GIS and will expand the existing, although modest, network of such measurements across the Arctic. This project will also provide a unique experience and educational opportunity through the combination of fieldwork and subsequent data processing for graduate students at the University of Colorado."

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Assessing the sensitivity of ice sheets to short term climate variability is at the forefront of the scientific community's and the public's interest because short term ice sheet change will drive 21st century sea level rise. Thus a central question of the proposed work is whether ice sheets react abruptly to climate forcings, or are multi-millennial-scale trends in climate required to elicit a large-scale ice sheet response?<br/><br/>The investigators propose an intensive field-based research program capitalizing on their newly published work reconstructing ice sheet change using high-precision beryllium-10 dating to test the hypothesis that prominent moraine systems marking former ice extents in West Greenland and Baffin Island record the synchronous advance of the Greenland and Laurentide ice sheets driven by the abrupt cooling events 9.3 and 8.2 thousand years ago. Pilot data reveal that portions of the ice sheet margin that are in contact with the surrounding ocean are able to respond rapidly to a short-lived climate perturbation. To test whether these documented changes were restricted to solely the most sensitive marine-terminating ice sheet sectors, or whether ice sheets are capable of a larger scale response to centennial-scale climate change, well-constrained chronologies of ice sheet change are needed from other regions. The investigators' research objectives are to 1) establish how land-terminating regions of ice sheets, which are more representative of broader ice sheet margins, respond to abrupt climate change, 2) further evaluate the role that oceanic forcing plays in modulating ice sheet response to short-lived climate perturbations, and 3) reconstruct the early Holocene behavior of mountain glacier systems (a proxy for summertime temperature) to evaluate what climatic conditions influenced the ice sheets.

In total, the ice sheet stores enough water to raise sea level by approximately 6 meters.  However, how surface meltwater generated in the summer makes its way from its location on the ice sheet to the ocean is not well understood.  Two competing but not mutually exclusive theories are 1) the meltwater percolates into the ice sheet pores and is stored for a relatively long time.  2) The initial infiltrating meltwater refreezes at shallow depth in the firm, forming a hard pan that prohibits further infiltration.  In this latter case, the meltwater quickly moves downslope along the surface of the ice sheet until it drains into the ocean.  Rennermalm will test these hypotheses through a combination of field work, remote sensing from satellites, and modeling.  Moreover, Rennermalm believes that during the most recent warming, the shallow refreezing mechanism has been playing a lesser role in the delivery of meltwater to the ocean than in previous times. To explore this hypothesis Rennermalm will compare the physical characteristics of modern cores with those extracted from earlier expeditions.<br/><br/>The project will involve graduate and undergraduate student training.

However, we do not fully understand how meltwater generated on the surface of the ice sheet makes its way to the ocean.  One line of thinking is that surface meltwater makes its way into the porous ice sheet where it is stored, either refrozen or in a liquid state, for relatively long times.  Alternatively, as proposed by these investigators, the first seasonal meltwater that makes its way into the shallow ice, refreezes and blocks further infiltration, resulting in water that quickly moves down the surface ice sheet until it enters the ocean.  Knowing the fate of meltwater is imperative if we are to understand how fast sea level will rise in the future.  These investigators will integrate field work, computer modeling, and analyze data from satellites."

For the remainder of the century and beyond, gaps in our understanding of iceberg calving and glacier retreat result in large uncertainties in predictions of mass loss and consequent sea level rise. This collaborative project is designed to reveal the factors controlling terminus retreat and iceberg calving in the diverse settings of Greenland's marine terminating glaciers.

Calving laws applied to conditions at and near glacier termini will predict terminus locations. Predictions will be compared to terminus positions observed in satellite and time-lapse images to identify model misfits. This calibration and validation analysis will reveal when and where specific calving laws reliably reproduce terminus positions and calving rates. Furthermore, extensions of this approach will (1) yield insight into the impact of crevasse water storage on iceberg calving, (2) guide the inclusion of submarine melting to improve prediction by calving laws, and (3) quantify the critical timescales over which glacier properties must be characterized for the prediction of calving rates and terminus positions."

Brown macroalgae (seaweeds) form extensive undersea forests in the northern portion of this region where they play a key role in providing both physical structure and a food (carbon) source for shallow water communities. Yet between Anvers Island (64 degrees S latitude) and Adelaide Island (67 S latitude) these macroalgae become markedly less abundant and diverse. This is probably because the habitat to the south is covered by more sea ice for a longer period, and the sea ice reduces the amount of light that reaches the algae. The reduced macroalgal cover undoubtedly impacts other organisms in the food web, but the ways in which it alters sea-floor community processes and organization is unknown. This project will quantitatively document the macroalgal communities at multiple sites between Anvers and Adelaide Islands using a combination of SCUBA diving, video surveys, and algal collections. Sea ice cover, light levels, and other environmental parameters on community structure will be modelled to determine which factors have the largest influence. Impacts on community structure, food webs, and carbon flow will be assessed through a mixture of SCUBA diving and video surveys. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, as well as numerous informal public education activities including lectures, presentations to K-12 groups, and a variety of social media-based outreach.<br/><br/>Macroalgal communities are more abundance and diverse to the north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, perhaps due to the greater light availability that is associated with shorter period of sea-ice cover.

First, satellite data on sea ice extent and water turbidity will be used to select study sites between 64 S and 69 S where the extent of annual sea ice cover is the primary factor influencing subsurface light levels. Then, variations in macroalgal cover across these study sites will be determined by video line-transect surveys conducted by SCUBA divers. The health, growth, and physiological status of species found at the different sites will be determined by quadrat sampling. The relative importance of macroalgal-derived carbon to the common invertebrate consumers in the foodweb will be assessed with stable isotope and fatty acid biomarker techniques. This will reveal how variation in macroalgal abundance and species composition across the sea ice cover gradient impacts sea floor community composition and carbon flow throughout the food web. In combination, this work will facilitate predictions of how the ongoing reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover that is occurring in the region as a result of global climate change will impact the structure of nearshore benthic communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interaction of the these two major players - magnetic fields and charged particles - takes various forms and produces many interesting electromagnetic phenomena such as aurorae (Northern and Southern lights), plasma waves, natural electromagnetic radiation and currents, etc., especially in the polar areas where this interaction is most intense and reaches close to the Earth. Studying these phenomena is important since they affect satellite instrumentation and communication, as well as important technologies such as GPS (Global Positioning System). <br/><br/>A research effort previously funded by NSF and performed in Antarctica within the last few years made new discoveries related to natural electromagnetic phenomena in the polar areas. These discoveries are: (1) correlations between powerful auroral kilometric radiation observed at ~200,000 km above the Earth and analogous signals observed simultaneously at the South Pole Station; (2) discovery of radiation at a high harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency (an important frequency at which charged particles oscillate in a magnetic field); and (3) discovery of a new type of radio emission of auroral origin. These phenomena are best observed, and in most cases can only be observed, using instruments deployed in Antarctica where a manmade electromagnetic interference is minimal.<br/><br/>The new research built on these discoveries will significantly advance our knowledge of the Earth's natural electromagnetic environment, which in turn has significant impact on the broader Geospace environment and space weather because of how interconnected these systems are. Furthermore, the new discoveries probed by this research represent   outstanding questions of Geospace research that have escaped scientists' attention so far. The research is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of the Geospace domain and provide students at Dartmouth College with an opportunity to obtain good skills and experience with experimental measurements and data analysis."

Antarctic insects have unique survival mechanisms including the ability to tolerate freezing and extensive dehydration, surviving the loss of 70% of their body water. How this is done is of interest not only for understanding seasonal adaptations of insects and how they respond to climate change, but the molecular and physiological mechanisms employed may offer valuable insights into more general mechanisms that might be exploited for cryopreservation and long-term storage of human tissues and organs for transplantation and other medical applications. The investigators will study the proteins that are responsible for removing water from the body, cell level consequences of this, and how the responsible genes vary between populations. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. Each year a K-12 teacher will be a member of the field team and assist with fieldwork and outreach to school children and their teachers. Educational outreach efforts include presentations at local schools and national teacher meetings, providing lesson plans and podcasts on a website, and continuing to publish articles related to this research in education journals. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will receive extensive training in all aspects of the research project with extended experiences that include publication of scientific papers and presentations at national meetings.<br/><br/>This project focuses on deciphering the physiological and molecular mechanisms that enable the Antarctic midge Belgica antarctica to survive environmental stress and the loss of most of its body water in the desiccating polar environment. This extremophile is an ideal system for investigating mechanisms of stress tolerance and local geographic adaptations and its genome has recently been sequenced.  This project has three focal areas: 1) Evaluating the role of aquaporins (water channel proteins) in the rapid removal of water from the body by studying expression of their genes during dehydration; 2) Investigating the mechanism of metabolic depression and the role of autophagy (controlled breakdown of cellular components) as a mediator of stress tolerance by studying expression of the genes responsible for autophagy during the dehydration process; and 3)  Evaluating the population structure, gene flow, and adaptive variation in physiological traits associated with stress tolerance using a genetic approach that takes advantage of the genomic sequence available for this species coupled with physiological and environmental data from the sampled populations and their habitats."

Scientists are working to understand the causes and consequences of this change and have a critical role in communicating their findings with diverse stakeholders. The pace of polar change demands continuous investment in training and educating the next generation of polar professionals who are prepared to be leaders in academia, government, industry, and policy. The Joint Science Education Project (JSEP) and the Joint Antarctic School Expedition (JASE) are two NSF-sponsored polar-focused programs that provide significant opportunities for training the next generation of STEM professionals and for polar-science outreach. JSEP, a project of the Joint Committee, was initiated in 2007 to educate students and teachers from Greenland, Denmark, and the U.S. The program brings US students together with Danish and Greenlandic students in Greenland where the group spends three weeks studying the causes and consequences of Arctic environmental change. JASE, a project in collaboration with the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), takes U.S. students to Antarctica to work alongside Chilean students and examine Antarctica's rapidly changing ecosystems. This award provides funding for Dartmouth College to lead the U.S. contributions to JSEP and JASE for the next four years. Dartmouth will organize a nation-wide application process to select high school student participants each year and will work with the international program coordinators to design student activities and learning experiences. In addition to coordinating each field-based program for U.S. high school students, Dartmouth will work to broaden the impact of these programs by sending a team of graduate student and faculty researchers with polar field experience to lead scientific components of JSEP and JASE, work with Greenlandic and Chilean educators to disseminate JSEP and JASE polar science outcomes to local audiences during the field-based expeditions, adapt JSEP and JASE polar science field activities for use in U.S. and international classrooms, provide training in cross-cultural science communication for diverse audiences to Dartmouth graduate students and the campus community, and assess skill- and content-based outcomes for high school and graduate student participants in JSEP and JASE. Societal benefits include building international networks of students, educators, stakeholders, future leaders, and polar scientists; diversifying the US polar scientific workforce, and generating polar science educational tools and modules that are freely accessible to students and teachers in multiple languages. This program addresses national priorities by developing a U.S. scientific workforce that is knowledgeable about the Arctic and the Antarctic, regions that are of growing importance to U.S. economic development and national security.<br/><br/>The Joint Committee, a high-level government forum between the U.S., Greenlandic, and Danish governments, initiated JSEP during the International Polar Year in 2007. Since its inception, high school students and teachers from Greenland, Denmark, and the U.S. have traveled to Greenland to participate in two JSEP educational programs, Kangerlussuaq Science Field School and Science and Education Week. In 2013, the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), invited the United States to participate in their Expedicin Antrtica Escolar (EAE), a program to promote awareness and appreciation of Antarctica in young Chileans. Since then, U.S. teams have joined three JASE expeditions, which provide hands-on experience with Antarctic research to high school students and teachers from both nations. Both JSEP and JASE aim to 1) educate and inspire the next generation of polar scientists, 2) build strong networks of students, teachers and researchers among the participating countries, and 3) improve language and communication skills by taking teams of students to the polar regions to share in polar science activities. The program will strengthen international scientific ties between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland and improve the understanding of polar science for students and citizens of all three countries. Dartmouth will conduct assessments of outcomes for the current high school students and graduate student polar fellows as well as surveys of alumni from previous U.S., Danish, Greenlandic, and Chilean participants. The JSEP program will provide U.S. high school students and high school teachers with an immersion experience in polar science and international collaboration. It will also provide graduate students with experience and training in teaching, cross-cultural communications and outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of all the LTER sites is to conduct policy-relevant research on ecological questions that require tens of years of data, and cover large geographical areas.  For the Palmer Antarctica LTER, the questions are centered around how the marine ecosystem west of the Antarctica peninsula is responding to a climate that is changing as rapidly as any place on the Earth. For example, satellite observations over the past 35 years indicate the average duration of sea ice cover is now ~90 days (3 months!) shorter than it was.  The extended period of open water has implications for many aspects of ecosystem research, with the concurrent decrease of Adlie penguins within this region regularly cited as an exemplar of climate change impacts in Antarctica. Cutting edge technologies such as autonomous underwater (and possibly airborne) vehicles, seafloor moorings, and numerical modeling, coupled with annual oceanographic cruises, and weekly environmental sampling, enables the Palmer Antarctica LTER to expand and bridge the time and space scales needed to assess climatic impacts. This award includes for the first time study of the roles of whales as major predators in the seasonal sea ice zone ecosystem. The team will also focus on submarine canyons, special regions of enhanced biological activity, along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP).<br/><br/>The current award's overarching research question is: How do seasonality, interannual variability, and long term trends in sea ice extent and duration influence the structure and dynamics of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling? Specific foci within the broad question include: 1. Long-term change and ecosystem transitions. What is the sensitivity or resilience of the ecosystem to external perturbations as a function of the ecosystem state? 2. Lateral connectivity and vertical stratification. What are the effects of lateral transports of freshwater, heat and nutrients on local ocean stratification and productivity and how do they drive changes in the ecosystem? 3. Top-down controls and shifting baselines. How is the ecosystem responding to the cessation of whaling and subsequent long-term recovery of whale stocks? 4. Foodweb structure and biogeochemical processes. How do temporal and spatial variations in foodweb structure influence carbon and nutrient cycling, export, and storage? The broader impacts of the award leverage local educational partnerships including the Sandwich, MA STEM Academy, the New England Aquarium, and the NSF funded Polar Learning and Responding (PoLAR) Climate Change Education Partnership at Columbia's Earth Institute to build new synergies between Arctic and Antarctic, marine and terrestrial scientists and students, governments and NGOs. The Palmer Antarctic LTER will also conduct appropriate cross LTER site comparisons, and serve as a leader in information management to enable knowledge-building within and beyond the Antarctic, oceanographic, and LTER communities."

They have undergone unprecedented changes within the past decade.  Initial studies on the potential remote and larger scale influences of their variability have often been inconclusive and even contradictory.  In a recent review article, the principal investigators (PIs) of this proposal hypothesized that sea ice and snow cover can combine to force large-scale atmospheric variability.  This project focuses on analyzing reanalysis datasets and model output from targeted numerical modeling experiments in order to understand the physical pathways linking sea ice and snow cover variability with atmospheric climate variability.  This variability may, in turn, influence mid-latitude weather on seasonal time scales.  Understanding such processes is anticipated to improve weather prediction on similar time scales, with consequent benefits to the energy, farming, and reinsurance industries, amongst others.  The project will contribute to STEM manpower development through providing support for the training of a graduate student, entrainment of undergraduate students into scientific research, and development of a short course of climate prediction. Finally, the project will promote international collaboration with a German research institute.<br/><br/>Prescribed sea ice and snow cover perturbation experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) will lead to a quantitative assessment of the physical pathways between sea ice, snow cover and the initiation and maintenance of atmospheric variability, particularly in winter, that cannot be accomplished using statistical analysis alone.  The use of a high-top model, which has only recently become available, to study the influence of sea ice and snow cover on the hemispheric winter circulation is novel to this proposal.  In parallel, the PIs will collaborate with colleagues running similar experiments with ECHAM6.  They will further analyze reanalysis atmospheric data, to test hypotheses about the combined role of sea ice and snow cover in climate variability learned from the model output.  The proposed project will analyze the combined impact of sea ice and snow cover anomalies on atmospheric climate variability.  This will improve understanding of the atmospheric response associated with changes in sea ice and snow cover, and lead to a quantitative assessment of the links between high-latitude and lower-latitude climates as well as enable improved climate predictions.  The proposed research focuses specifically on the combined role of sea ice and snow cover in the initiation and maintenance of the dominant mode of high-latitude atmospheric variability, i.e. the annular mode.  Modulation of the annular mode is hypothesized to be a key physical mechanism for climate feedback in high latitudes and is the dominant mode of variability in the mid-latitudes including the industrial centers of the United States, Europe and Asia.  The conceptual framework developed in this project will be applied in an operational seasonal forecast model at the end of the project."

Recent models predict that complete summertime Arctic sea ice loss will likely occur in the first half of the 21st century. The rapidly-declining areal expanse of summer pack ice will lead to changes in microbial community structure and production within both sea-ice communities and in the open waters of the Arctic Ocean. As summer sea ice microbial communities are replaced by open ocean populations, identifying changes in chemical compounds, such as various aerosols, that are released to the atmosphere might play a significant role in determining the future rate and impact of sea ice decline. The aerosols produced by microorganisms will ultimately move across the sea to air boundary and could affect cloud formation and with feedbacks that impact the Arctic system.  In this study, the investigators will use state-of-the art methods to measure the relative abundances of aerosols that are associated with the microbial communities found in sea ice, melt ponds, sea ice leads, and in the open ocean. Better understanding of the changes in the structure of these microbial communities will provide new information for the next generation of models and may lead to more sophisticated understanding of various climate feedback loops. In addition, the project involves a collaboration with Swedish polar researchers and will strengthen scientific linkages between scientists in the USA and Sweden. The project will support training for graduate and undergraduate students, and the investigators will share research results with the public through lectures, as part of the Cultivate Program, and social media. <br/><br/>The investigators will investigate how in-situ microbial community composition and productivity in contrasting sea-ice and open-ocean Arctic ecosystems impact the production and release of biogenic, volatile organic carbon (VOC) compounds. These VOC compounds are instrumental in the release and production of aerosols that ultimately form cloud condensation nuclei. In addition, the investigators will perform shipboard manipulative experiments to determine the effects of elevated sea surface temperatures, enhanced light intensities, and lower salinities resulting from melting sea ice and enhanced water column stratification. These changes will impose physiological stress on microbial communities that is likely to impact both phytoplankton community structure and the flux of the biogenic sulfur trace gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). The investigators will test how temperature, salinity, and light will affect the composition of the microbial community and thereby the catabolic fate of the DMS precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), to yield either DMS or methanethiol and methane (CH4). In addition, the investigators will test whether the high CH4 concentrations observed in Arctic Ocean surface waters are due to DMSP catabolism or, alternatively, the breakdown of methylphosphonate. Using state-of-the-art instrumentation, they will monitor VOC fluxes using a shipboard Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), a Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer, and high speed sorting flow cytometer to measure VOCs, net community production, and microbial community composition, respectively. They will make direct measurements of VOCs within sea ice by using a newly developed ice crusher attached to the PTR-MS to provide new in-situ data on the concentrations of DMS and CH4 in sea ice communities."

AWS stations measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of ~ 2-3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be taken. Observational data from the AWS are collected via Iridium network, or DCS Argos aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. The surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The surface observations made from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite and remote sensing observations.<br/><br/>This project proposes to use the surface conditions observed by the AWS network to determine how large-scale modes of climate variability impact Antarctic weather and climate, how the surface observations from the AWS network are linked to surface layer and boundary layer processes, and to quantify the impact of snowfall and blowing snow events. Specifically, this project proposes to improve our understanding of the processes that lead to unusual weather events and how these events are related to large-scale modes of climate variability. This project will fill a gap in knowledge of snowfall distribution, and distinguishing between snowfall and blowing snow events using a suite of precipitation sensors near McMurdo Station."

This meltwater percolates and refreezes within the underlying snow. Over time, this altered snow, which is referred to as firn, can reach to depths of 100 meters. These changes in firn structure consequently alter the heat flow within the ice, and between the ice sheet and the atmosphere. As yet however, the full structure of the firn layer is unclear as observations have been limited to shallow depths. To address this important lack of understanding, the investigators propose a field study focused on drilling a number of deep ice cores, with the goal of characterizing the thermal and physical properties of the deep firn ice. This information is essential to predicting ice sheet changes in volume and sea level rise. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students, an early career scientist, and includes public outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the deep firn in the low elevation regions of Greenland experience densification governed by water infiltration/refreezing and thermally enhanced compaction. The project will develop a novel hot water drilling system to quickly penetrate 100 meters through the technically challenging conditions of intermixed cold and wet firn. In situ data collection will include digital temperature strings, video and core logging, and an instrumented drill stem. This work will yield a full-depth characterization of firn thickness, density, permeability, and thermal status. Moreover, drilling conducted a decade earlier in the region will permit the investigators to assess changes in firn properties over time. Ultimately, understanding meltwater retention and refreezing processes across Greenland?s accumulation area is essential for advancing prediction of ice sheet volume change,flow dynamics, and sea level change.

Many geospace phenomena are caused by solar flares and coronal mass ejections that have their effects transmitted to ionospheric layers, which are especially strong in the polar regions. The ionospheric plasma convection (that carries ionospheric currents) becomes strong during geomagnetic storms when it moves as a whole over both polar caps from dayside to nightside and then returns to the dayside via respective auroral zones. Polar ionospheres are also electrically connected via the Earth's magnetic field lines in conjugate points.

Numerical models of glacier flow that are used to forecast future conditions must include a component that accounts for the sliding of the ice over its bed.  The sliding process is poorly modeled because of lack of detailed information about the bottom of glaciers, leading to increased uncertainty in the ice-flow models.

The AMOC is expected to weaken or even collapse in the coming centuries, with several recent studies suggesting that this weakening has already begun. The AMOC collapse would not only severely impact climate in the North Atlantic region but would also weaken the monsoon rains that a large portion of the global population depends on for their livelihood. Studying ice cores can shed light on past changes in the strength of the AMOC and can help scientists better understand the stability and behavior of this important ocean circulation system. Greenland ice cores and ocean sediment records show that during the last Ice Age (100,000 to 20,000 years ago) the AMOC repeatedly collapsed and restarted, resulting in a series of extreme climate oscillations commonly known as Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles. Each D-O event consists of an abrupt (decadal-scale) warming episode (increase of 8-15 degrees Centigrade) observed in Greenland ice cores, leading to a few millennia of warmer climate followed by a gradual cooling back to full glacial conditions. The proposed research will develop temperature records from two Greenland ice cores to determine both the geographic distribution as well as the intensity of the D-O events throughout Greenland. These records will provide a spatial ?fingerprint? of the D-O events, which can be used a forensic tool to determine the location of D-O warming and the migration of the sea-ice edge around Greenland during these events. These data will be included in climate simulations using state-of-the-art global climate models to improve our understanding of the physical nature of these enigmatic events. The research will contribute to reliable timescales for the two ice cores, with benefits to the wider ice core community. The work will support an early-career scientist and a graduate student and will also provide outreach to public schools. <br/><br/>Understanding the physical processes that drive the Earth?s climate system throughout a Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) event remains an important open scientific question in paleoclimate research. The spatial pattern of D-O warming holds clues to the origin of D-O events, in particular whether the critical geographic area is located in the Labrador Sea or in the GIN (Greenland, Iceland, Norwegian) seas. Ultra-high-resolution stable isotope records from these ice cores document changes in the hydrological cycle associated with these abrupt warming episodes. Climate models show that the southern Dye-3 ice core is more sensitive to abrupt climate change than previously analyzed ice cores, giving the possibility of observing for the first time the temperature imprint of a Heinrich event (a natural phenomenon in which large armadas of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic Ocean), as well as the largest D-O warmings ever observed. Isotope enabled climate model simulations will provide improved interpretation of changes in second-order isotope parameters (deuterium- and 17O excess) through D-O and Heinrich-events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The sign and magnitude of a feedback, however, depends critically on the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of a background climate. Due to internal variability of the climate system and fluctuations in external forcing, climate models inevitably excite low frequency variability and generate a wide range of background climates. The drift of feedbacks with these background climates, hence the transient behavior of climate feedbacks, presents a major challenge in our assessment of the risk of climate change acceleration and abrupt climate change. Delineating the evolving nature of feedback processes in a model is of particular importance for understanding the source of both the skill and bias in decadal climate prediction. However, the lack of a local measure of feedback strength has greatly limited our ability to make connections between actual model predictions (e.g., local temperature change) and transient behavior of climate feedbacks.<br/><br/>This project will use a newly-developed technique, the coupled atmosphere-surface climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) to tackle this problem.

Nowhere have the changes been more pronounced, nor happened as quickly, as in the Arctic Ocean. Pack-ice is melting, water is warming, storms are becoming stronger and more frequent, and basic circulation patterns are being altered. Our project focuses on the fate of the Pacific water that enters the Arctic Ocean through the Bering Strait. Pacific water plays a critical role in the western Arctic ecosystem. In wintertime the cold inflowing water provides nutrients that spur the growth of phytoplankton at the base of the food chain. In summertime, the warm water melts pack ice and provides freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. After the water crosses the Chukchi Sea, north of Bering Strait, some of it forms a narrow current at the edge of the shelf and flows eastward. As part of our project we will continue to maintain a mooring positioned in the center of the current to measure its physical and biological properties. The mooring has been deployed (with a few gaps) since 2002, and during this time it has measured striking changes that need to be placed in the context of the evolving Arctic system. In addition, we will carry out shipboard surveys of the current and adjacent waters when we service the mooring, to provide a larger-scale view of the fate of the Pacific water.<br/>  <br/>The monitoring mooring is situated at 152oW near the Beaufort Sea shelf break, roughly 150 km downstream of Pt. Barrow. It will be deployed for two years from fall 2016 to fall 2018. This will extend the time series at this location to 13 years. The mooring records the velocity of the water column and pack ice using two ADCPs, and measures temperature, salinity, and pressure using a series of MicroCats spaced along the wire. Chlorophyll fluorescence and nitrate will be measured at 35 m (at the top float of the mooring), and a passive acoustic recorder situated near the base of the mooring will record marine mammal calls. Zooplankton concentration will be estimated using the ADCP backscatter data. Among other things, this will allow us to determine how much water, heat, nutrients, chlorophyll, and freshwater are transported by the current, and, importantly, assess how much exchange occurs between the interior of the Arctic Ocean and the boundary waters. Upwelling occurs during all seasons along the Beaufort slope, and it appears to be increasing as the climate warms. The mooring is ideally suited to quantify the upwelling, as well any downwelling that occurs. The shipboard sampling will include sampling of some of the Distributed Biological Observatory transects, which will contribute to those ongoing time series."

The Arctic ice pack has suffered continued thinning and reduction in seasonal extent, resulting in changes to the amount of sunlight penetrating through the ice and into the ocean beneath, having consequences for the physical and biological environment. Sunlight absorbed by the ocean under the ice causes warming, which can lead to accelerated ice melt resulting in even more sunlight reaching the ocean. In addition, warmer water also affects living organisms, influencing the ability of Arctic adapted species to survive, and possibly promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice also increases light available for photosynthesis, affecting the timing of phytoplankton blooms. If phytoplankton growth occurs early in the season then zooplankton, the organisms that feed on them can miss the bloom with consequences for the entire food web of the Arctic. This project aims to provide observations to help determine how the under-ice environment is changing by using autonomous buoys which overcome the limitations of ship-based observations. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near-real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf.  <br/>This project will continue the WARM buoy initiative by improving the existing design to include increased vertical resolution of temperature and light measurements, the addition of salinity measurement to enable water mass identification, and a second fluorometer to identify sinking phytoplankton biomass. The data collected will provide a time series of important physical and biogeochemical properties over a complete seasonal cycle. It will enable us to address questions related to the effects of a thinner and more open ice pack on the absorption of solar radiation, ocean heating, the phenology of pelagic primary production, and carbon cycling. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf.  The Arctic ice pack acts as a barrier controlling the availability of UV and visible light to the water column. Continued thinning and reduction of seasonal Arctic ice has resulted in alterations in the timing and magnitude of solar radiation penetrating the upper Arctic Ocean. Amplification of solar radiation absorption into the ocean acts to warm and stratify the surface layer, which can induce further ice retreat and delay fall freeze-up. Resulting thermal stratification affects the ecosystem by limiting vertical replenishment of nutrients with a direct consequence on the magnitude of primary production. A warmer water column can also play a fundamental role in setting thresholds for the abundance and distribution of plankton communities, affecting trophic efficiency and promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice increases the light available for photosynthesis and net primary production, affecting the timing of primary production. Small timing mis-match between phytoplankton blooms and zooplankton reproductive cycles can have consequences for the entire lipid-driven Arctic marine ecosystem. Changes in the duration of UV exposure through longer open water periods has the potential to increase photochemical remineralization of terrestrial and marine organic matter and production of labile organic material that can be used by microbes. Determining the impact of solar radiation changes on warming, primary production, and photochemistry are all critical in assessing and predicting the effects of climate change on the marine carbon cycle. The measurement of these variables within and beneath the seasonal ice pack is challenging due to the limitations of ship based observations, but this can be resolved by using the autonomous WARM buoys deployed within the ice and designed to survive ice melt."

These measurements are expected to be very useful in helping to meet the goals of the U.S. Arctic GEOTRACES expedition: namely, to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. A primary source of lead-210 to the oceans is from the atmosphere, where it is produced from the decay of radon-222. In the oceans, it decays to polonium-210. The half-lives of polonium-210 (138 days) and lead-210 (22.3 years) provide ""natural clocks"" with which to investigate processes such as the sorption of elements on to sinking particles, and the transport of elements between the ocean margins and deep basins.<br/><br/>The lead investigator proposes to concentrate sampling and investigate processes at three ""interfaces:"" the air-sea-ice interface at the surface, the interface between biologically produced particles and water, and the interface between non-biological particles and water. The investigator proposes the following three hypotheses: 1) At the air-sea interface, the polonium-210/lead-210 ratios can be used to ""age date"" the sea ice (and sediments contained within the ice).  2) At the biotic-water interface, different biogenic particle types encountered in the upper waters will affect the fractionation and remineralization depths of polonium-210 and lead-210. 3) At the particle-water interface, layers of resuspended sediments in the water column will be zones of enhanced polonium and lead scavenging from the surrounding waters. These processes are important for understanding the distributions of other key particle-reactive trace elements such as iron, lead, and manganese. To test these hypotheses, the investigator will sample and analyze about four hundred dissolved and particulate (large and small) samples, 10 multi-year ice cores, ice-rafted sediments, and water from melt ponds for polonium-210 and lead-210 along the GEOTRACES Western Arctic section. About half of the samples will be focused at the four designated ""super stations"", with half of these in the highly dynamic upper water column and the other half near the sea floor where resuspension of bottom sediments can affect element cycling. The depths will be chosen according to regional atmospheric input, ecosystems, and coordinated sampling with groups measuring other trace elements and isotopes. The remainder of the samples will be ice cores, water from melt ponds, ice-rafted sediments in sea ice, and atmospheric aerosol samples. The proposed work will be closely coordinated with other GEOTRACES. The broader impacts are closely linked to the GEOTRACES program as a whole to enhance (1) research infrastructure by providing a broad array of polonium-210 and lead-210 data useful for biogeochemical scavenging models, (2) education by mentoring graduate and undergraduates, teaching by example&#8232;from proposed research, (3) participation of under-represented students careers in the geosciences, (4) research training of graduates in marine radiochemistry, and 5) broad dissemination of results through publications, presentations, and on dedicated public Wayne State University websites (www.clas.wayne.edu) and at GEOTRACES (www.geotraces.org)."

The importance of the interactions between these groups of organisms in the ecology of coastal Antarctica are well known and often mediated by chemical defenses in the tissues of the algae.  These chemicals are meant to deter feeding by snails and other marine animals making the Antarctic Peninsula an excellent place to ask important questions about the functional and evolutionary significance of chemical compound diversity for marine communities. This project will focus on three main objectives: the first objective is to expand the current understanding of the relationship between algae and their associated marine animals. The second objective focuses on the diversity of chemical compounds used to defend algae from being consumed. The third objective seeks to understand how marine animals can benefit from these compounds by consuming the algae that contain them, and then using those compounds to chemically deter predators. The field components of this research will be performed during three expeditions to the US Palmer Station, Antarctica. During these expeditions, a variety of laboratory feeding bioassays, manipulative field and laboratory experiments, and on-site chemical analyses will be performed. The investigators will also foster opportunities to integrate their NSF research with a variety of educational activities. As in the past they will support undergraduate research, both through NSF programs as well as home, university-based, programs, and they will also continue to support and foster graduate education. Through their highly successful University of Alabama in Antarctica interactive web program (two time recipient of awards of excellence from the US Council for Advancement and Support of Education), they will continue to involve large numbers of teachers, K-12 students, and other members of the community at large in their scientific endeavors in Antarctica. In addition, the investigators have hosted K-12 teachers on their Antarctic field teams through the former NSF Teachers Experiencing Antarctica and the Arctic program and will pursue participation in PolarTREC, the successor to this valuable program. Moreover, they will actively participate in outreach efforts by presenting numerous talks on their research to local school and community groups. <br/><br/>The near shore environments of the western Antarctic Peninsula harbor rich assemblages of macroalgae and macroinvertebrates. The importance of predator-prey interactions and chemical defenses in mediating community-wide trophic interactions makes the western Antarctic Peninsula an excellent place to ask important questions about the functional and evolutionary significance of defensive compound diversity for marine communities. This project will focus on three main objectives which are a direct outcome of the past studies of the chemical ecology of shallow-water marine macroalgae and invertebrates on the Antarctic Peninsula by this group of investigators. The first objective is to expand the current understanding of a community-wide mutualism between macroalgae and their associated amphipods to include gastropods, which are also abundant on many macroalgae. The second objective focuses on the diversity of chemical compounds used to defend macroalgae from being consumed, particularly in the common red alga Plocamium cartilagineum. The third objective seeks to understand the relationship between P. cartilagineum and the amphipod Paradexamine fissicauda, including the ecological benefits and costs to P. fissicauda resulting from the ability to consume P. cartilagineum and other chemically defended red algae. The investigators will focus on the costs and benefits related to the ability of P. fissicauda to sequester defensive compounds from the alga P. cartilagineum and use those chemicals to defend itself from predation. The field components of this research will be performed during three expeditions to Palmer Station, Antarctica. During these expeditions, a variety of laboratory feeding bioassays, manipulative field and laboratory experiments, and on-site chemical analyses will be performed.

Diatom growth fuels the SO food web and balances atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering the carbon used for growth to the deep ocean on long time scales as cells sink below the surface. The diatom growth is limited by the available iron in the seawater, most of which is not freely available to the diatoms but instead is tightly bound to other compounds. The nature of these compounds and how phytoplankton acquire iron from them is critical to understanding productivity in this region and globally. The investigators will conduct experiments to characterize the relationship between diatoms, their associated bacteria, and iron in open ocean and inshore waters. Experiments will involve supplying nutrients at varying nutrient ratios to natural phytoplankton assemblages to determine how diatoms and their associated bacteria respond to different conditions. This will provide valuable data that can be used by climate and food web modelers and it will help us better understand the relationship between iron, a key nutrient in the ocean, and the organisms at the base of the food web that use iron for photosynthetic growth and carbon uptake. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project supports early career senior investigators and the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as outreach activities with middle school Girl Scouts in Rhode Island, inner city middle and high school age girls in Virginia, and middle school girls in Florida.<br/><br/>The project combines trace metal biogeochemistry, phytoplankton cultivation, and molecular biology to address questions regarding the production of iron-binding compounds and the role of diatom-bacterial interactions in this iron-limited region. Iron is an essential micronutrient for marine phytoplankton. Phytoplankton growth in the SO is limited by a lack of sufficient iron, with important consequences for carbon cycling and climate in this high latitude regime. Some of the major outstanding questions in iron biogeochemistry relate to the organic compounds that bind >99.9% of dissolved iron in surface oceans. The investigators' prior research in this region suggests that production of strong iron-binding compounds in the SO is linked to diatom blooms in waters with high nitrate to iron ratios. The sources of these compounds are unknown but the investigators hypothesize that they may be from bacteria, which are known to produce such compounds for their own use. The project will test three hypotheses concerning the production of these iron-binding compounds, limitations on the biological availability of iron even if present in high concentrations, and the roles of diatom-associated bacteria in these processes. Results from this project will provide fundamental information about the biogeochemical trigger, and biological sources and function, of natural strong iron-binding compound production in the SO, where iron plays a critical role in phytoplankton productivity, carbon cycling, and climate regulation."

The project joins indigenous knowledge, language, and oral heritage with the material and chronometric evidence of<br/>archaeology, geology, and paleoenvironmental studies to document the cultural history and landscape of Yakutat Bay, where dramatic glacial recession after C. E. 1100 attracted major concentrations of harbor seals and opened the fiord for Sugpiaq, Eyak, Ahtna, and Tlingit settlement.  The research team proposes that a clan-based system of local and external access rights developed around Yakutat sealing because of its economic centrality for peoples of the eastern Gulf of Alaska; that sealing camps shifted from the outer<br/>to the inner bay over time to follow the receding glacial front; and that the locations, artifact assemblages, faunal remains, and spatial layouts of camps express the cultural and social organization of hunting in different eras. They hypothesize that situated knowledge of Yakutat Bay?s human and environmental history is encoded in living oral traditions and multilingual toponyms that richly delineate this nine-century cultural landscape, and that oral heritage can be chronologically correlated with archaeological and geological data. The study leads from the past to the present day, when the continuity of sealing and of the community?s cultural and linguistic heritage are matters of urgent local concern. The methodologies and results of this study are highly relevant to questions of human adaptation and resiliency in the changing North and to the challenge of building coherence between indigenous and scientific knowledge systems."

Most of these lakes are termed ""thermokarst"" because they form in ice-rich permafrost and gradually expand over time. The dynamic nature of thermokarst lakes also makes them prone to catastrophic drainage and abrupt conversion to wetlands, called drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs). Together, thermokarst lakes and DTLBs cover up to 80% of arctic lowland regions, making understanding their response to ongoing climate change essential for coastal plain environmental assessment. Catastrophic lake drainage and subsequent ecosystem succession in DTLBs has long intrigued scientists concerned with permafrost, vegetation, and carbon storage. Less attention however has been devoted toward predicting where and when lakes will drain and the magnitude and impacts of downstream flooding. A related process, snow-dam outburst floods from existing DTLBs, has also been overlooked so far in arctic hydrology. Floods generated from snow-dam outburst may help explain abnormally large flood peaks in many arctic rivers and will be increasingly important to consider for future petroleum development and the need to expand roads and pipeline through coastal plain terrain. This research on catastrophic lake drainage is relevant to improving our understanding of permafrost and hydrological processes; identifying flood and ground stability hazards; and predicting future vegetation, terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and carbon storage dynamics.<br/><br/>A combination of remote sensing, field observations, and a lake-drainage experiment are targeted at understanding the causes and consequences of DTLB formation and their broader feedbacks with other arctic system components. Data collected in this study will feed into future model development to enhance predictive capacity of hydrologic hazards and landscape responses to climate change in the Arctic. Space-for-time comparison of DTLB chronosequences provides the conceptual framework for linking process scales. The new conceptual model emerging from this project is important for a number of stakeholders and native villages, where water access, habitat mitigation, and hazard avoidance are a priority. The understanding of hazards and environmental processes gained from this research will advance the interests of industry, land managers, and subsistence users on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Evidence that marine mammals use the Earth's magnetic field for navigation is less clear but numerous reports infer this sensory capability in a variety of marine mammals. Mistakes in this mechanism may be involved in mass strandings of whales and dolphins and a better understanding of marine mammal navigation ultimately may be useful in preventing or forecasting these events. Weddell seals precisely locate breathing holes in Antarctic sea ice after traveling hundreds of meters in darkness and a navigation mistake can result in death. In this project, the investigators will test a novel idea about marine mammal sub-ice navigation and orientation using geomagnetic fields by employing a custom-designed video and data recorder capable of monitoring fine-scale animal behaviors and movements when diving. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. The general public will be involved via web sites, a lecture series targeting underrepresented groups, and development of nationally disseminated K-12 teaching materials. A number of graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in the techniques of scientific discovery over the course of the project.<br/><br/>With limited oxygen stores during under-ice diving, Weddell seals are under strong selective pressure to navigate accurately and efficiently to locate breathing holes. The investigators hypothesize that geomagnetic navigation is both necessary and sufficient for Weddell seals to return to the vicinity of breathing holes. This project will be the first to rigorously field test geomagnetic navigation in a marine mammal as well as the first to measure the energetic cost of geomagnetic navigational behavior and evaluate how body oxygen stores and breath-hold duration influence spatial orientation and navigational strategies in a diving mammal. The investigators will measure changes in the behavioral and energetic responses of individual seals to different geomagnetic field properties and test those responses against precise predictions. By conducting tests during periods of high light intensity/long day length and low light intensity/reduced day length while simultaneously documenting sound sources and water currents, the experimental design provides a powerful technique for identifying a geomagnetic response as other sensory modalities are manipulated. These costs will be compared to those of other vertebrates to assess the evolutionary drivers for geomagnetic navigation. Demonstration of geomagnetic navigation in seals would also provide new insights into fine scale activities of other diving animals and the mechanisms that enable long distance migrations. Thus, the results have the potential to transform our understanding of navigation in all diving animals."

What types of barriers affected this connectivity, and how permeable were these barriers to gene flow? The PIs will study how caballine horses, that inhabited ice-age Beringia (the biogeographic connector between Asia and North America), were affected by changes involving three different biogeographic barriers/corridors (1. the Bering Strait/Bering Land Bridge, which controlled dispersal and gene flow between Eurasia and Alaska; 2. the Ice-Free Corridor, which controlled gene flow between the Yukon and the Lower 48 States; and 3. biome shifts that periodically disrupted the spatial continuity of the Mammoth-Steppe, the unique ecosystem that stretched from France to the Yukon during the ice ages) during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. This study will evaluate the effects that each of these putative barriers to gene flow had on the abundance, distribution, and evolutionary trajectories of ice-age horses in the Arctic using new paleogenomic and paleoenvironmental data. The results will provide new insights into the roles played by environmental change and population fragmentation in determining extinction risk, and help predict how ongoing environmental changes will affect arctic ecosystems.

The combined collection will be housed a new 33,000 square foot building with refrigerated space that can hold both collections with approximately five decades of expansion space.  The co-location and co-management of these two collections offers unique curatorial synergies, cost savings, and improved capabilities to support both the research and educational needs of a wider marine and Antarctic communities.   The facility will house a 32-person seminar room, a large 1,044 square foot core lab that allows layout, inspection and examination of cores, and adjoining analytical laboratories that will provide quantitative analysis as well as experiential learning opportunities for students.  This award fund the transition and physical movement of the collection from Florida State to Oregon State.  The transition plan is split into three phases, starting in January 2017 with reconnaissance of the current Antarctic core collection in Florida, data entry in the current repository database (Phase 1), labeling of all cores before they are put in boxes (Phase 2) and carrying out the actual move (Phase 3) in the first nine months of the transition plan. The goal is to finish the entire transition and full digital curation of the collection by 1 May 2018.   The transition plan was developed to incorporate the best curatorial practices and to facilitate a successful move and transition of the irreplaceable Antarctic core collection from Florida State University to Oregon State University.<br/>"

Changes in the Arctic are even being felt in tropical regions through increased drought frequency and the intensity of water shortages.  These changes are continuing to occur at faster and faster rates and are recognized and amplified by the shrinking of the Arctic's sea ice, the thawing of permafrost and ancient carbon emissions into the atmosphere, declining terrestrial snow pack, shrub encroachment of the tundra, and more frequent and prolonged Arctic Vortex blasts of cold air and snow into the US, Europe and Scandinavia. One of the most important changes that is central to the entirety of Arctic change is how the water cycle is behaving now, how it interacts with sea ice and how weather events dictate transport of Arctic moisture and air into the lower latitudes and how low latitude moisture is transferred into the Arctic, dictating precipitation patterns and the delivery of freshwater around the north.  However, understanding how the Arctic water cycle is behaving over the entire calendar year, including during polar night with measurements and observations directly in the Arctic Basin during winter has been tremendously difficult as the region at times is almost as remote and inhospitable as the dark side of the moon.  The goal of this project is to test, measure and develop a completely new understanding of the real-time behavior of the Arctic water cycle continuously during 1.5 years as part of a major Arctic climate initiative involving land-based stations in coordination with simultaneous measurements aboard the Polarstern icebreaker.  <br/>These coordinated, real-time measurements will take place as the icebreaker drifts during fall, winter, spring and summer from the eastern Arctic, across the North Pole, along the east coast of Greenland and into the Barents Sea region. This project will take continuous measurements of water vapor and precipitation chemistry from Thule Air Base and Station Nord in Greenland and will be coordinated with measurements being taken on the ship and from other land-based stations in the Arctic.  This simultaneous data will be used in new visualization packages to display, share and observe how sea ice, atmospheric transport patterns, and weather patterns are dictating the distribution of water vapor and precipitation throughout the Arctic and into North America, Europe, Scandinavia and Eurasia. This project has several broader impacts, outreach and educational outcomes. By coordinating the measurements with the MOSAiC drift mission, it will contribute to the collective wisdom and understanding of the Arctic System, helping to develop a more holistic understanding of it?s behavior over an entire year, including the most unresolved period, polar night & winter.  The project also aims to educate students in classrooms during the observation period of what is discovered, including real-time depictions of water vapor and precipitation chemistry as storm systems develop and then propagate across the Arctic Basin and from the Arctic Basin into North America and Europe and from Europe and North America into the Arctic. The project includes training a postdoctoral scientist whereby she/he will become familiar with cutting edge technology and she/he will have opportunities to explore new venues of study by working with like-generation scientists from many of the Artic countries including partners from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.  The project also aims to develop a new set of Arctic Water Cycle and Arctic Change lectures to be offered through UArctic (http://education.uarctic.org/studies/courses) and posted for public access. These lectures will also be made available to the global community including the US, Finnish, Swedish, German, Danish and Norwegian societies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Arctic ice pack has suffered continued thinning and reduction in seasonal extent, resulting in changes to the amount of sunlight penetrating through the ice and into the ocean beneath, having consequences for the physical and biological environment. Sunlight absorbed by the ocean under the ice causes warming, which can lead to accelerated ice melt resulting in even more sunlight reaching the ocean. In addition, warmer water also affects living organisms, influencing the ability of Arctic adapted species to survive, and possibly promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice also increases light available for photosynthesis, affecting the timing of phytoplankton blooms. If phytoplankton growth occurs early in the season then zooplankton, the organisms that feed on them can miss the bloom with consequences for the entire food web of the Arctic. This project aims to provide observations to help determine how the under-ice environment is changing by using autonomous buoys which overcome the limitations of ship-based observations. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near-real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf.  <br/>This project will continue the WARM buoy initiative by improving the existing design to include increased vertical resolution of temperature and light measurements, the addition of salinity measurement to enable water mass identification, and a second fluorometer to identify sinking phytoplankton biomass. The data collected will provide a time series of important physical and biogeochemical properties over a complete seasonal cycle. It will enable us to address questions related to the effects of a thinner and more open ice pack on the absorption of solar radiation, ocean heating, the phenology of pelagic primary production, and carbon cycling. The buoys have proven to be very robust and can survive for approximately one year, providing hourly observations which will be available in near real time to the research community and interested public parties. The buoys will be deployed in early spring in the western Beaufort Sea, with anticipated drift west over the Chukchi Shelf.  The Arctic ice pack acts as a barrier controlling the availability of UV and visible light to the water column. Continued thinning and reduction of seasonal Arctic ice has resulted in alterations in the timing and magnitude of solar radiation penetrating the upper Arctic Ocean. Amplification of solar radiation absorption into the ocean acts to warm and stratify the surface layer, which can induce further ice retreat and delay fall freeze-up. Resulting thermal stratification affects the ecosystem by limiting vertical replenishment of nutrients with a direct consequence on the magnitude of primary production. A warmer water column can also play a fundamental role in setting thresholds for the abundance and distribution of plankton communities, affecting trophic efficiency and promoting the northward advancement of sub-Arctic species. Thinner ice increases the light available for photosynthesis and net primary production, affecting the timing of primary production. Small timing mis-match between phytoplankton blooms and zooplankton reproductive cycles can have consequences for the entire lipid-driven Arctic marine ecosystem. Changes in the duration of UV exposure through longer open water periods has the potential to increase photochemical remineralization of terrestrial and marine organic matter and production of labile organic material that can be used by microbes. Determining the impact of solar radiation changes on warming, primary production, and photochemistry are all critical in assessing and predicting the effects of climate change on the marine carbon cycle. The measurement of these variables within and beneath the seasonal ice pack is challenging due to the limitations of ship based observations, but this can be resolved by using the autonomous WARM buoys deployed within the ice and designed to survive ice melt."

The appearance of herring in the spring signals the start of the seasonal round after a long winter.  Herring is a key dietary resource during this time, but to some, herring is an economic mainstay throughout the year. Alaska Natives, as well as a range of North Pacific species, depend on abundant and geographically widespread populations of herring.  In 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill devastated Prince William Sound herring populations in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Thorne and Thomas2008). The southern Gulf of Alaska has been impacted by commercial fishing, habitat degradation, and environmental changes over the past century. Bering Sea communities also depend on herring; in the words of Nelson Islander Louise Kanrilak, ?herring are very important to us.  When we are out of herring, we are out of food? (Barker 1993:73). The scientific debate over the status of herring has been complicated by the lucrative commercial sac roe fishery that supplies herring eggs for Asian markets. Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers have witnessed the decline of herring (Thornton et al. 2010a) and many argue that herring are being managed in a depleted state. Alaska Native subsistence fishers and egg-collectors are sounding the alarm, while biologists debate whether herring populations are ?endangered,? ?threatened? or ?struggling? (Carls et al. 2009).  Herring have already abandoned some spawning locations (ADFG 2011), and several First Nations in British Columbia have been forced to stop harvesting herring and spawn altogether (Speller et al. 2010).<br/><br/>This project aims to demonstrate how zooarchaeological and paleo-genetic research can be used to understand the dynamics of ancient fishing and fisheries and produce new knowledge that can advance resource conservation today.  It will support the development and refinement of new methods of recovering and studying ancient DNA, and will greatly expand knowledge of the long-term history of Alaska Native use of herring.  By encompassing the entire range of Pacific herring across Alaska, it will complement current efforts in British Columbia and integrate the knowledge of social scientists, biologists, and Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers.  The health of herring is essential to the entire North Pacific marine ecosystem.  Archaeological assemblages from across coastal Alaska constitute an unmatched archive of environmental data.  This project aims to develop a more complete understanding of the ancient Alaska Native use of herring to better assess the historical abundance, biogeography, and genetic diversity of herring in the past. This effort aims to improve herring fisheries management to benefit a wide range of stakeholders in the Arctic, subarctic, and beyond. The project will gather samples of herring bones from archaeological sites across coastal Alaska for ancient DNA analysis.  Preliminary work has shown that ancient mitochondrial DNA can be extracted from herring bones and is well-preserved. Yang and colleagues are working to extract nuclear DNA, which will facilitate comparisons to genetic results emerging from the study of the DNA of extant herring.  In this project, ancient DNA from 150 herring bone samples will be studied to establish phylogenetic and geographic relationships.  The age of many of these samples is established, but radiocarbon dates will be obtained for those samples lacking dates.<br/><br/>Understanding the temporal context will allow the researchers to identify changes over time.  Collaborations between archaeologists, Native communities, biologists, and managers working in BritishColumbia and Washington State will permit region-wide understanding of the ancient use of herring across the North Pacific.  The results of the genetic study will be disseminated to six communities in coastal Alaska through a traveling workshop which will leave behind resource materials that can be exhibited and will stimulate further study and engagement in management."

In many Alaskan rural communities, whose primary population is Alaska Native people, the elderly are still relied upon for their deep knowledge and understanding of the natural environment, heritage languages, and cultural practices which are important not only for economic survival but social cohesion and community wellbeing.  However, change is deeply affecting Alaska Native communities and Alaska Native people are forced to adapt to the new environmental, economic and social realities that affect their worlds.  This research project will explore how Alaska Native elderly are adapting to rapid economic, environmental, and social change by exploring Alaska Native elderly and their own understanding and definition of what successful aging means to them.  <br/><br/>The current research project will establish a better understanding of successful aging from the perspectives of Alaska Native elderly in Northwest Alaska. Being the Principal Investigators second research project on this topic, this project has the potential to inform future studies of indigenous successful aging, studies that allow the elderly themselves to subjectively define for themselves what it means to age well.  In the spirit of community-based participatory research, several communities in Northwest Alaska reached out to the principal investigator, Dr. Jordan P. Lewis (Aleut, Native Village of Naknek), to request that similar research be conducted in their region.  They did so after learning of his ""Successful Aging Study,"" which was carried out in Bristol Bay Alaska from 2011-2014 and brought awareness of the value of positive, or generative, focused research with the elderly, highlighting their lessons and knowledge for healthy aging. <br/><br/>This research study will consist of 60 qualitative in-depth interviews with Alaska Native elderly to establish an indigenous understanding of what successful aging means for Alaska Natives in Northwest Alaska and what is required to age in place.  Interviews will be conducted with Alaska Native elderly and their family members in their own homes in five participating communities, as well as those who have relocated to the Quyanna Care facility in Nome, Alaska. Through these interviews the research team will to explore the concept of successful aging and hope to gain a sense of Alaska Native beliefs about aging, what is required to age in place? and how relocation to facilities for the elderly impacts views of successful aging?  In the spirit of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), participants will be engaged through the entire research process, from conception to data analysis. Meetings will be held in participating communities to review the findings and receive feedback; this will ensure the findings reflect the unique perspectives of the Elders, families, communities, and region. These findings will also be compared with the previous study on successful aging conducted in Bristol Bay to compare and contrast experiences of aging in these two rural regions of Alaska. This study will also explore what is required to age in place to reduce or eliminate the need for the elderly to relocate - taking with them the language, culture, and history of the community.  Previous research by the PI has shown that enabling older Alaskan Native people to remain in their homes and communities contributes to the health and wellbeing of the communities. The research will shed additional light on what it means to age well in rural Alaska and determine what role their community plays in how Alaska Native people subjectively define their aging process.  <br/><br/>The significance of this proposed research advances discovery through the establishment of a locally and culturally informed, Alaska Native, understanding of successful aging that builds on the PI's previous projects. In addition to contributing to the academic literature on successful aging, it promotes teaching and learning from the Elders on healthy aging in rural Alaska.  It also educates researchers on the importance of CBPR and allowing the elderly to subjectively define their aging process, as well as engaging the local community throughout the entire research process, which promotes the coproduction of knowledge and bi-directional learning. This research project broadens the participation of underrepresented groups (Alaska Natives) and puts them on equal footing with the scientists in interpreting results and in presenting the results.  This research also has the potential to contribute to the disciplines of anthropology, gerontology, community psychology, sociology, and others by paving the way for future researchers interested in indigenous aging.  <br/><br/>The research findings can influence health and social policy in Alaska and how healthcare and long-term support services are delivered to older residents in rural communities. The results of this research will be published and be disseminated for other researchers, gerontologists, anthropologists, and students to use with the permission of the tribal governing authorities, the Alaska Native participants and their  communities. This study will also highlight that aging does not have to equal poor health and immobility; aging well should be a right that can be attained by everyone.   This research has the potential to inform health professionals, policy advocates, local and state officials about the factors that determine whether or not rural Alaska communities are able to meet the needs of their elderly and enable them to live their remaining years as they may wish."

While the Icelanders survived centuries of adverse climate, volcanic eruptions, large-scale soil erosion, epidemic disease, and harsh world-system economic impacts to develop a modern society now ranking high in international assessments of quality of life, their relatives in Norse Greenland suffered complete extinction by the mid-15th century CE. Why did one northern community achieve sustainability on the millennial scale, while its near neighbor underwent genuine social-environmental system (SES) collapse despite centuries of successful adaptation and what we now recognize as comparatively resilient economic management? How can the lessons of these thousand year cases of long term human ecodynamics and their radically different outcomes be more effectively understood and interpreted for the wider effort to mobilize the past to serve modern efforts to secure a genuinely sustainable future? What lessons of survival and extinction can be learned and taught for both local northern community heritage and for global education for sustainability?  These questions are not only relevant to Norse in the 14th -15th centuries but have the potential to inform research that can provide insights into social decisions that are key to the long-term sustainability of human and environmental systems on earth.  The project combines the data and expertise of history, human bioarchaeology, zooarchaeology, archaeobotany, geoarchaeology, artifact distribution, stable isotopic analysis, geochronology, environmental modeling, and K-12 and college education professionals. It brings together teams of scientists, educators, and local residents from across the region and create genuinely transdisciplinary and genuinely transformative approaches to shared problems of human survival and sustainable adaptation in the north."

However, the timeline of collapse and the effects of ongoing climatic and oceanographic changes are key unanswered questions. Complete disintegration of the ice sheet would raise global sea level by more than 3 m, which would have significant societal impacts.  Improved understanding of the controls on ice-sheet evolution is needed to make better predictions of ice-sheet behavior. Results from numerical models show that buttressing from surrounding ice shelves and/or from small-scale grounded ice rises should act to slow the retreat and discharge of ice from the interior ice sheet. However, there are very few field observations with which to develop and validate models. Field observations conducted in the early 1980s on Crary Ice Rise in the Ross Sea Embayment are a notable exception. This project will revisit Crary Ice Rise with new tools to make a suite of measurements designed to address questions about how the ice rise affects ice discharge from the Ross Sea sector of West Antarctica.  The team will include a graduate and undergraduate student, and will participate in a range of outreach activities.<br/><br/>New tools including radar, seismic, and GPS instruments will be used to conduct targeted geophysical measurements both on Crary Ice Rise and across its grounding line. The project will use these new measurements, together with available ancillary data to inform a numerical model of grounding line dynamics. The model and measurements will be used to address the (1) How has the ice rise evolved over timescales ranging from: the past few decades; the past millennia after freeze-on; and through the deglaciation? (2) What history of ice dynamics is preserved in the radar-detected internal stratigraphy? (3) What dynamical effect does the presence/absence of the ice rise have on discharge of the Ross Ice Streams today? (4) How is it contributing to the slow-down of the proximal Whillans and Mercer ice streams? (5) What dynamical response will the ice rise have under future environmental change?"

Most of these weathering reactions consume atmospheric gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and therefore chemical weathering can drive natural, long-term changes in atmosphere chemistry. The nutrients released from rocks by chemical weathering are transported to the oceans and are necessary for the maintenance of life on Earth. The principal aim of this project is to assess how much chemical weathering occurs beneath Antarctica's largest ice sheet. Elsewhere in the world, chemical weathering is assessed by analyzing the outflow of rivers, but such direct measurements of chemical outflow are not possible because nearly all of Antarctica is covered by ice. In Antarctica investigators use samples from the Transantarctic Mountains where the interaction of flowing ice with mountain peaks causes rock and mineral material to emerge from the glacier base. This project will assess the degree to which this emerging mineral material has been chemically weathered compared to the underlying rock and the time scale at which such weathering occurs.<br/> <br/>Technical Description<br/>Preliminary data from a Transantarctic Mountain site strongly suggests that the mineral products of chemical weathering (clays and oxides) are more abundant in the emerging material than in the underlying rocks. However, the chemical alteration of this material could have occurred recently or prior to glaciers forming in Antarctica. To constrain the timeline of weathering and thereby assess modern rates of weathering in Antarctica, this p[project will analyze two rare, radioactive isotopes within the weathered minerals. Because these isotopes are lost through radioactive decay, they act as clocks that can time the formation of the clays and oxides that form during chemical weathering. Minerals that pre-date the ice will have these isotopes clinging to their surface but not in their crystal structure. By first chemically removing the elements on the surface on the clays and oxides and then analyzing the minerals themselves, the project investigators will determine whether the minerals formed recently under the ice or beforehand in an ice-free environment. By calculating how recently these minerals formed and by analyzing the rate at which ice transports them off the continent, they will be able to calculate chemical weathering rates at locations up and down the Transantarctic Mountains. The result will be an estimate the impact of weathering under the East Antarctic ice sheet on the chemistry of the Earth's ocean nutrients. This research will provide valuable training for the next generation of polar scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The associated ice mass loss is responsible for approximately half the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise thus far this century. For the remainder of the century and beyond, gaps in our understanding of iceberg calving and glacier retreat result in large uncertainties in predictions of mass loss and consequent sea level rise. This collaborative project is designed to reveal the factors controlling terminus retreat and iceberg calving in the diverse settings of Greenland's marine terminating glaciers. The project contributes to STEM workforce development by providing support to two early-career scientists from EPSCoR states, undergraduate student participation at both institutions, and for training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators will continue their active outreach, including museum and classroom visits in the rural settings around their universities, presentations to non-technical groups, and media features.<br/><br/>This project will substantially improve our understanding of marine terminating glacier dynamics via the analysis of recently-available observational datasets. Through these data, the project will evaluate the performance of terminus parameterizations used in numerical ice sheet models, known as ""calving laws."" Application at 49 diverse marine-terminating glaciers around Greenland (nearly a quarter of the ice sheet total) ensures that project results will be representative. Calving laws applied to conditions at and near glacier termini will predict terminus locations. Predictions will be compared to terminus positions observed in satellite and time-lapse images to identify model misfits. This calibration and validation analysis will reveal when and where specific calving laws reliably reproduce terminus positions and calving rates. Furthermore, extensions of this approach will (1) yield insight into the impact of crevasse water storage on iceberg calving, (2) guide the inclusion of submarine melting to improve prediction by calving laws, and (3) quantify the critical timescales over which glacier properties must be characterized for the prediction of calving rates and terminus positions."

AWS stations measure air-temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction at a nominal surface height of ~ 2-3m. Other parameters such as relative humidity and snow accumulation may also be taken. Observational data from the AWS are collected via Iridium network, or DCS Argos aboard either NOAA or MetOp polar orbiting satellites and thus made available in near real time to operational and synoptic weather forecasters. The surface observations from the AAWS network are important records for recent climate change and meteorological processes. The surface observations from the AAWS network are also used operationally, and in the planning of field work. The surface observations made from the AAWS network have been used to check on satellite and remote sensing observations.<br/><br/>This project proposes to use the surface conditions observed by the AWS network to determine how large-scale modes of climate variability impact Antarctic weather and climate, how the surface observations from the AWS network are linked to surface layer and boundary layer processes, and to quantify the impact of snowfall and blowing snow events. Specifically, this project proposes to improve our understanding of the processes that lead to unusual weather events and how these events are related to large-scale modes of climate variability.

However, methods of observing sea ice thickness at regional or basin scales with sufficient accuracy and resolution to capture growth and melt processes, detect hazards, or assess habitat quality are lacking. This project will develop an Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) snow radar system capable of being integrated into long-range Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).

They feed on smaller organisms and in turn are eaten by larger animals, including seals and killer whales.  Little is known about how rising ocean temperatures will impact the development of Antarctic fish embryos and their growth after hatching.  This project will address this gap by assessing the effects of elevated temperatures on embryo viability, on the rate of embryo development, and on the gene ""toolkits"" that respond to temperature stress. One of the two species to be studied does not produce red blood cells, a defect that may make its embryos particularly vulnerable to heat.  The outcomes of this research will provide the public and policymakers with ""real world"" data that are necessary to inform decisions and design strategies to cope with changes in the Earth's climate, particularly with respect to protecting life in the SO. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists, including providing scientific training for undergraduate and graduate students, and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This includes the unique educational opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research in Antarctica and engaging the public in several ways, including the development of professionally-produced educational videos with bi-lingual closed captioning.<br/><br/>Since the onset of cooling of the SO about 40 million years ago, evolution of Antarctic marine organisms has been driven by the development of cold temperatures. Because body temperatures of Antarctic fishes fall in a narrow range determined by their habitat (-1.9 to +2.0 C) they are particularly attractive models for understanding how organismal physiology and biochemistry have been shaped to maintain life in a cooling environment. The long-term objective of this project is to understand the capacities of Antarctic fishes to acclimatize and/or adapt to rapid oceanic warming through analysis of their underlying genetic ""toolkits."" This objective will be accomplished through three Specific Aims: 1) assessing the effects of elevated temperatures on gene expression during development of embryos; 2) examining the effects of elevated temperatures on embryonic morphology and on the temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression; and 3) evaluating the evolutionary mechanisms that have led to the loss of the red blood cell genetic program by the white-blooded fishes. Aims 1 and 2 will be investigated by acclimating experimental embryos of both red-blooded and white-blooded fish to elevated temperatures. Differential gene expression will be examined through the use of high throughput RNA sequencing. The temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression in the context of embryonic morphology (Aim 2) will be determined by microscopic analysis of embryos ""stained"" with (hybridized to) differentially expressed gene probes revealed by Aim 1; other developmental marker genes will also be used. The genetic lesions resulting from loss of red blood cells by the white-blooded fishes (Aim 3) will be examined by comparing genes and genomes in the two fish groups."

The sign and magnitude of a feedback, however, depends critically on the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of a background climate. Due to internal variability of the climate system and fluctuations in external forcing, climate models inevitably excite low frequency variability and generate a wide range of background climates. The drift of feedbacks with these background climates, hence the transient behavior of climate feedbacks, presents a major challenge in our assessment of the risk of climate change acceleration and abrupt climate change. Delineating the evolving nature of feedback processes in a model is of particular importance for understanding the source of both the skill and bias in decadal climate prediction. However, the lack of a local measure of feedback strength has greatly limited our ability to make connections between actual model predictions (e.g., local temperature change) and transient behavior of climate feedbacks.<br/><br/>This project will use a newly-developed technique, the coupled atmosphere-surface climate feedback-response analysis method (CFRAM) to tackle this problem. The study will take advantage of modern reanalysis products and the multi-model ensemble products from the decadal prediction experiments of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to explore CFRAM's full potential in quantifying local and transient behavior of climate feedbacks and understanding the skill and bias of a model's ability to simulate decadal climate prediction. Specific research tasks that will be undertaken are (i) to quantify the relative contributions of various feedbacks to the annual cycle and interannual to decadal variations in surface air temperature (SAT) using reanalyses data; (ii)to evaluate the fidelity of CMIP5 models in representing the SAT annual cycle and decadal prediction of SAT; and (iii) to examine the attribution of models skills and biases in the ability to simulate decadal climate predictions and identify feedback processes that have major contributions to both systematic errors in the SAT annual cycle and forecast errors in decadal prediction of SAT."

The process is central to the global nitrogen cycle, affecting everything from retention of fertilizer on croplands to removal of excess nitrogen from coastal waters before it can cause blooms of harmful algae.  It also produces nitrous oxide, an ozone-destroying, greenhouse gas.  The energy derived from both steps of nitrification is used to convert inorganic carbon into microbial biomass. The biomass produced contributes to the overall food web production of the Southern Ocean and may be a particularly important subsidy during winter when low light levels restrict the other major source of biomass, primary production by single-celled plants.  This project addresses three fundamental questions about the biology and geochemistry of polar oceans, with a focus on the process of nitrification.  The first question the project will address concerns the contribution of chemoautotrophy (based on nitrification) to the overall supply of organic carbon to the food web of the Southern Ocean.

As part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC), the investigators will use a research vessel frozen into polar ice as a sampling platform to focus on the influence of sea ice on the uptake and release of oxygen and methane across a full annual cycle. Combined with other observations made by MOSAiC collaborators, these data will allow the investigators to build a detailed conceptual model of carbon and energy flow across seasons and improve numerical models explaining the behavior of the broader Arctic system. In addition, they will use genomic techniques to gain a new understanding of microbial dynamcis and diversity in this understudied region. The broader impacts of this work include support for early-career scientists, significant international collaboration as part of the MOSAiC program, and training for postdoctoral scientists and undergraduate students. Public outreach will include viewings of the Northwest Polar Passage documentary Frozen Obsession in San Diego, CA, and Providence, RI, followed by panel discussions on polar exploration, ecology, and change.<br/>  <br/>The goal of this project is to identify the biological and physical drivers underlying the production and uptake of oxygen and methane, establishing the metabolic balance of these key gases in the oligotrophic Central Arctic.

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This meltwater percolates and refreezes within the underlying snow. Over time, this altered snow, which is referred to as firn, can reach to depths of 100 meters. These changes in firn structure consequently alter the heat flow within the ice, and between the ice sheet and the atmosphere. As yet however, the full structure of the firn layer is unclear as observations have been limited to shallow depths. To address this important lack of understanding, the investigators propose a field study focused on drilling a number of deep ice cores, with the goal of characterizing the thermal and physical properties of the deep firn ice. This information is essential to predicting ice sheet changes in volume and sea level rise. The project involves graduate and undergraduate students, an early career scientist, and includes public outreach activities.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the deep firn in the low elevation regions of Greenland experience densification governed by water infiltration/refreezing and thermally enhanced compaction. The project will develop a novel hot water drilling system to quickly penetrate 100 meters through the technically challenging conditions of intermixed cold and wet firn. In situ data collection will include digital temperature strings, video and core logging, and an instrumented drill stem. This work will yield a full-depth characterization of firn thickness, density, permeability, and thermal status. Moreover, drilling conducted a decade earlier in the region will permit the investigators to assess changes in firn properties over time. Ultimately, understanding meltwater retention and refreezing processes across Greenland?s accumulation area is essential for advancing prediction of ice sheet volume change,flow dynamics, and sea level change. The project will provide field and laboratory research experiences impacting a large number of undergraduate and graduate students.

As the Antarctic continent becomes warmer and wetter due to climate change, plants are colonizing newly exposed ground, and are predicted to become more dominant. However, little is known about how warming will affect Antarctic plant communities or how increasing overall terrestrial communities of a continent, as is occurring in Antarctica via warming, will progress. Using experiments to artificially increase temperatures in plant communities in an international collaboration with biologists from Chile, this project will focus on understanding how warming will affect reproduction and chemistry of Antarctic plants. Through understanding the impacts of warming on plant biology, the project will address the critical issue of how a warming climate will impact the on-going re-vegetation of a rapidly changing continent. The project will further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists by training multiple graduate and undergraduate students. As a central part of this research effort, the investigators will develop graduate student training and collaboration between institutions in Chile and the U.S including bringing students from Chile to be trained in new techniques in their laboratories in the U.S as well as allowing U.S. students to travel to Chile for research collaboration.<br/> <br/>Climate change is shifting species distributions worldwide, and as temperatures continue to increase an unprecedented large-scale effect on these shifting species assemblages is predicted. Mosses are the dominant vegetation in polar regions but in contrast to Arctic systems, we know relatively little about the role of Antarctic mosses in organizing communities and less still on how warming influences Antarctic moss communities. The investigators will use Open Top Chamber passive warming experiments, which have been installed for five years by their Chilean collaborator on King George and Livingston Islands, and will concentrate on how warming impacts bryophyte productivity, sexual systems, and secondary chemistries, and on how these changes affect community processes. A suite of ecological, physiological, and molecular approaches will be used to examine how warming impacts species-specific moss function, community assembly, and ultimately, the moss-mediated engineering of the Antarctic ecosystem. The team will test three integrated research hypotheses: 1) Warming will alter moss species composition, moss sex ratio, and differentially impact moss productivity and reproductive success in Antarctica; 2) Warming will impact the production of moss secondary compounds, influencing the dynamics of biotic interactions and biosphere-atmosphere exchange in terrestrial Antarctica; and 3) Warming will alter moss-microbe interactions, resulting in alterations to the moss food web and community dynamics in terrestrial Antarctica.  These data will be the first comprehensive measures of how Antarctic mosses engineer their environment and thereby drive terrestrial responses to warming."

This project will quantitatively document the macroalgal communities at multiple sites between Anvers and Adelaide Islands using a combination of SCUBA diving, video surveys, and algal collections. Sea ice cover, light levels, and other environmental parameters on community structure will be modelled to determine which factors have the largest influence. Impacts on community structure, food webs, and carbon flow will be assessed through a mixture of SCUBA diving and video surveys. Broader impacts include the training of graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, as well as numerous informal public education activities including lectures, presentations to K-12 groups, and a variety of social media-based outreach.<br/><br/>Macroalgal communities are more abundance and diverse to the north along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, perhaps due to the greater light availability that is associated with shorter period of sea-ice cover. This project will determine the causes and community level consequence of this variation in algal community structure. First, satellite data on sea ice extent and water turbidity will be used to select study sites between 64 S and 69 S where the extent of annual sea ice cover is the primary factor influencing subsurface light levels. Then, variations in macroalgal cover across these study sites will be determined by video line-transect surveys conducted by SCUBA divers. The health, growth, and physiological status of species found at the different sites will be determined by quadrat sampling. The relative importance of macroalgal-derived carbon to the common invertebrate consumers in the foodweb will be assessed with stable isotope and fatty acid biomarker techniques. This will reveal how variation in macroalgal abundance and species composition across the sea ice cover gradient impacts sea floor community composition and carbon flow throughout the food web. In combination, this work will facilitate predictions of how the ongoing reductions in extent and duration of sea ice cover that is occurring in the region as a result of global climate change will impact the structure of nearshore benthic communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antarctic insects have unique survival mechanisms including the ability to tolerate freezing and extensive dehydration, surviving the loss of 70% of their body water. How this is done is of interest not only for understanding seasonal adaptations of insects and how they respond to climate change, but the molecular and physiological mechanisms employed may offer valuable insights into more general mechanisms that might be exploited for cryopreservation and long-term storage of human tissues and organs for transplantation and other medical applications. The investigators will study the proteins that are responsible for removing water from the body, cell level consequences of this, and how the responsible genes vary between populations. The project will also further the NSF goals of making scientific discoveries available to the general public and of training new generations of scientists. Each year a K-12 teacher will be a member of the field team and assist with fieldwork and outreach to school children and their teachers. Educational outreach efforts include presentations at local schools and national teacher meetings, providing lesson plans and podcasts on a website, and continuing to publish articles related to this research in education journals. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students will receive extensive training in all aspects of the research project with extended experiences that include publication of scientific papers and presentations at national meetings.<br/><br/>This project focuses on deciphering the physiological and molecular mechanisms that enable the Antarctic midge Belgica antarctica to survive environmental stress and the loss of most of its body water in the desiccating polar environment. This extremophile is an ideal system for investigating mechanisms of stress tolerance and local geographic adaptations and its genome has recently been sequenced.  This project has three focal areas: 1) Evaluating the role of aquaporins (water channel proteins) in the rapid removal of water from the body by studying expression of their genes during dehydration; 2) Investigating the mechanism of metabolic depression and the role of autophagy (controlled breakdown of cellular components) as a mediator of stress tolerance by studying expression of the genes responsible for autophagy during the dehydration process; and 3)  Evaluating the population structure, gene flow, and adaptive variation in physiological traits associated with stress tolerance using a genetic approach that takes advantage of the genomic sequence available for this species coupled with physiological and environmental data from the sampled populations and their habitats."

Most of these lakes are termed ""thermokarst"" because they form in ice-rich permafrost and gradually expand over time. The dynamic nature of thermokarst lakes also makes them prone to catastrophic drainage and abrupt conversion to wetlands, called drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs). Together, thermokarst lakes and DTLBs cover up to 80% of arctic lowland regions, making understanding their response to ongoing climate change essential for coastal plain environmental assessment. Catastrophic lake drainage and subsequent ecosystem succession in DTLBs has long intrigued scientists concerned with permafrost, vegetation, and carbon storage. Less attention however has been devoted toward predicting where and when lakes will drain and the magnitude and impacts of downstream flooding. A related process, snow-dam outburst floods from existing DTLBs, has also been overlooked so far in arctic hydrology. Floods generated from snow-dam outburst may help explain abnormally large flood peaks in many arctic rivers and will be increasingly important to consider for future petroleum development and the need to expand roads and pipeline through coastal plain terrain. This research on catastrophic lake drainage is relevant to improving our understanding of permafrost and hydrological processes; identifying flood and ground stability hazards; and predicting future vegetation, terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and carbon storage dynamics.<br/><br/>A combination of remote sensing, field observations, and a lake-drainage experiment are targeted at understanding the causes and consequences of DTLB formation and their broader feedbacks with other arctic system components. Data collected in this study will feed into future model development to enhance predictive capacity of hydrologic hazards and landscape responses to climate change in the Arctic. Space-for-time comparison of DTLB chronosequences provides the conceptual framework for linking process scales. The new conceptual model emerging from this project is important for a number of stakeholders and native villages, where water access, habitat mitigation, and hazard avoidance are a priority.

Assessing the sensitivity of ice sheets to short term climate variability is at the forefront of the scientific community's and the public's interest because short term ice sheet change will drive 21st century sea level rise. Thus a central question of the proposed work is whether ice sheets react abruptly to climate forcings, or are multi-millennial-scale trends in climate required to elicit a large-scale ice sheet response?<br/><br/>The investigators propose an intensive field-based research program capitalizing on their newly published work reconstructing ice sheet change using high-precision beryllium-10 dating to test the hypothesis that prominent moraine systems marking former ice extents in West Greenland and Baffin Island record the synchronous advance of the Greenland and Laurentide ice sheets driven by the abrupt cooling events 9.3 and 8.2 thousand years ago. Pilot data reveal that portions of the ice sheet margin that are in contact with the surrounding ocean are able to respond rapidly to a short-lived climate perturbation. To test whether these documented changes were restricted to solely the most sensitive marine-terminating ice sheet sectors, or whether ice sheets are capable of a larger scale response to centennial-scale climate change, well-constrained chronologies of ice sheet change are needed from other regions. The investigators' research objectives are to 1) establish how land-terminating regions of ice sheets, which are more representative of broader ice sheet margins, respond to abrupt climate change, 2) further evaluate the role that oceanic forcing plays in modulating ice sheet response to short-lived climate perturbations, and 3) reconstruct the early Holocene behavior of mountain glacier systems (a proxy for summertime temperature) to evaluate what climatic conditions influenced the ice sheets. The investigators will work to make results easily accessible to the public. The work is led by an early career investigator and will support two graduate and several undergraduate students."

The Arctic Ocean has experienced significant changes over the last 30 years, including declining sea ice and increasing continental runoff. The Arctic is considered a harbinger of changes in the carbon and hydrological cycles, with important implications for regional and global climate. How the physical, chemical and biological structure of the Arctic Ocean will respond to such fundamental changes is poorly understood. The proposed research will provide novel insights about dissolved organic matter and its role in trace element cycling. Recent studies provide tantalizing data indicating the transport and fate of DOM and trace metals are closely linked in the Arctic Ocean, and suggesting an important role of continental runoff and sea ice formation in the distribution of DOM and associated trace metals.<br/><br/>Water samples will be collected and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, amino acids, lignin phenols and detailed optical characterization of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) during 3 expeditions in 2015 aboard the USCGC Healy, the German ice breaker Polarstern, and the Japanese research vessel Mirai. The combined optical and molecular analyses will be used to distinguish and quantify terrigenous and marine DOM and their potential interactions with trace elements. A probe for measuring in situ fluorescence of DOM will be interfaced with the CTD/rosette for high-resolution mapping and real-time examination of interesting features to guide sampling efforts. The U.S. and German expeditions are part of the international GEOTRACES program, whose goals are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. The U.S. Arctic GEOTRACES project has established a central outreach program for this research program including meetings with local communities in Alaska, recruiting a high school teacher to participate in the expedition and interact with schools in the US and beyond via a blog. These investigators will tie into the existing GEOTRACES outreach efforts and will link interested Texas and South Carolina Schools to the expedition blog. This project will train 3 graduate students in and expose about 6 undergraduate students to research in the Arctic Ocean. The goal of the teaching component of this project is to provide students with an experience that demonstrates the scientific method, from development of goals and hypotheses to experimental design and presentation of results. Findings of this project will be conveyed to the public using established links with local newspapers where students describe research projects in their own words."

However, the timeline of collapse and the effects of ongoing climatic and oceanographic changes are key unanswered questions. Complete disintegration of the ice sheet would raise global sea level by more than 3 m, which would have significant societal impacts.  Improved understanding of the controls on ice-sheet evolution is needed to make better predictions of ice-sheet behavior. Results from numerical models show that buttressing from surrounding ice shelves and/or from small-scale grounded ice rises should act to slow the retreat and discharge of ice from the interior ice sheet. However, there are very few field observations with which to develop and validate models. Field observations conducted in the early 1980s on Crary Ice Rise in the Ross Sea Embayment are a notable exception. This project will revisit Crary Ice Rise with new tools to make a suite of measurements designed to address questions about how the ice rise affects ice discharge from the Ross Sea sector of West Antarctica.  The team will include a graduate and undergraduate student, and will participate in a range of outreach activities.<br/><br/>New tools including radar, seismic, and GPS instruments will be used to conduct targeted geophysical measurements both on Crary Ice Rise and across its grounding line. The project will use these new measurements, together with available ancillary data to inform a numerical model of grounding line dynamics.

(2) What history of ice dynamics is preserved in the radar-detected internal stratigraphy? (3) What dynamical effect does the presence/absence of the ice rise have on discharge of the Ross Ice Streams today? (4) How is it contributing to the slow-down of the proximal Whillans and Mercer ice streams? (5) What dynamical response will the ice rise have under future environmental change?"

A small timing mismatch between species' life histories and their physical and biological environment can have significant consequences for them and for the entire arctic ecosystem. Climate warming is likely to cause earlier snowmelt on sea ice and speed its retreat in the Arctic, thus causing variability in the timing (phenology) of marine primary production. Such changes will significantly impact the pelagic consumers that rely on that primary production. The focus of this study is to understand the coupling between the physical environment, the timing and magnitude of primary production, and the secondary production of pelagic consumers by focusing on a single dominant species as a model. The copepod Calanus glacialis is a key member of arctic ecosystems, critical in the linkages among sea ice and ocean conditions, primary production, secondary production, upper trophic level consumers, and ultimately human communities. It also follows a life history that is closely timed to pulses of ice algal and phytoplankton primary production in the Arctic Ocean, making it an attractive focus of study because of the potential vulnerability of that life history to climatically induced disruptions to the biological and physical environment. The objectives are: to describe past conditions and predict future changes to selected characteristics of the marine physical environment that influence the production response (e.g., sea ice, water temperature); to explore the physical and biological factors controlling C. glacialis population dynamics; to investigate the interannual variability of its spatial distributions and possible shifts in life history strategy under ongoing climate change; and to identify the implications of those spatial and temporal shifts to secondary production and beyond. The research will combine a copepod individual-based model and a concentration-based biology-ice-ocean model into a spatially-explicit biological-physical coupled model, integrating remotely sensed and in-situ observational data and laboratory-derived copepod vital rates to project plankton production under future climate change scenarios."

This study will extend this work using output from reanalyses, model simulations from the CMIP5 archive, and experimental CESM model runs to investigate how and why the ongoing loss of arctic sea ice and high-latitude terrestrial snow cover may cause mid-latitude weather patterns to change. Past and projected patterns in 500 hPa heights will be analyzed using a combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) ? a neural-network-based technique that reduces large data sets to their representative patterns ? a new meridional circulation index, and an extreme weather index to address the hypothesis that Arctic Amplification of past and future global climate change promotes circulation patterns that favor extreme weather events in middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The PIs suggest that changes in the energy budget of the arctic surface, because of sea-ice loss and earlier snow melt on high-latitude land, reduce meridional thickness gradients, which induce generally weaker zonal flow aloft and higher amplitude circulation features. They think these upper-level flow patterns slow the eastward progression of large-scale atmospheric Rossby waves, favoring more persistent weather conditions that increase the probability of extreme weather such as cold-air outbreaks, heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. They believe the primary physical mechanism driving the change is an enhanced and seasonally varying arctic heating: in fall/winter it is ocean-based associated with substantial sea ice loss, while in warmer months it is land-based due primarily to earlier snow melt and reduced soil moisture. Higher-amplitude flow trajectories may also exacerbate sea-ice and snow-cover loss, thereby constituting a positive feedback loop.<br/><br/>Because extreme weather events, such as temperature and precipitation extremes, are often caused by high-amplitude, slow-moving upper-level circulation patterns, this analysis will focus on detecting and characterizing these patterns, interpreting the weather conditions associated with them, and identifying regions that are likely to be affected. This study attempts to connect arctic change with the rest of the global climate system.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Changes in extreme weather as a result of greenhouse gas accumulation will directly and dramatically affect millions of people across the globe, thus a better understanding and more accurate future projection of changes in the frequency, location, and severity of droughts, floods, and temperature extremes are urgently needed by decision-makers at all levels of society. Preliminary work has already attracted world-wide attention via articles in prominent newspapers, radio interviews, interviews for the Weather Channel, magazine articles, and numerous online blogs. This will also be an opportunity for a new post-doc. The PIs will prepare a module for the NSF-supported ?Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears? project for K-5 teachers. Both PIs make frequent public and school presentations on climate-change related issues, and because extreme weather is so relevant to society at large, results from the proposed study will figure prominently into these presentations."

Understanding changes in ocean dynamics during times of reduced ice volume and increased temperatures in the geologic past will improve the predictive models for these conditions.  The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a new oxygen isotope record of Pliocene oceanographic conditions near the Antarctic continent. Oxygen isotope values from the carbonate tests of benthic foraminifera have become the global standard for paleo-oceanographic studies, but foraminifera are sparse in high-latitude sediment cores. This research will instead make use of oxygen isotope measurements from diatom silica preserved in a marine sediment core from the Ross Sea. The project is the first attempt at using this method and will advance understanding of global ocean dynamics and ice sheet-ocean interactions during the Pliocene. The project will foster the professional development of two early-career scientists and serve as training for graduate and undergraduate student researchers. The PIs will use this project to introduce High School students to polar/oceanographic research, as well as stable isotope geochemistry. Collaboration with teachers via NSTA and Polar Educators International will ensure the implementation of excellent STEM learning activities and curricula for younger students. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>This project will produce a high-resolution oxygen isotope record from well-dated diatom rich sediments that have been cross-correlated with global benthic foraminifera oxygen isotope records. Diatom silica frustules deposited during the Early Pliocene and recovered by the ANDRILL Project (AND-1B) provide ideal material for this objective. Diatomite unites in the AND-1B core are nearly pure, with little evidence of opal formation. A diatom oxygen isotope record from this core offers the potential to constrain lingering uncertainties about Ross Sea and Southern Ocean paleoceanography and Antarctic Ice Sheet history during a time of high atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Specifically, oxygen isotope variations will be used to constrain changes in the water temperature and/or freshwater flux in the Pliocene Ross Sea.

Satellite imagery shows about half of the Ross Sea increases are associated with changes in the austral fall, when the new sea ice is forming.  The most pronounced changes are also located near polynyas, which are areas of open ocean surrounded by sea ice. To understand the processes driving the sea ice increase, and to determine if the increase in sea ice area is also accompanied by a change in ice thickness, this project will conduct an oceanographic cruise to the polynyas of the Ross Sea in April and May, 2017, which is the austral fall.  The team will deploy state of the art research tools including unmanned airborne systems (UASs, commonly called drones), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs).  Using these tools and others, the team will study atmospheric, oceanic, and sea ice properties and processes concurrently. A change in sea ice production will necessarily change the ocean water below, which may have significant consequences for global ocean circulation patterns, a topic of international importance. All the involved institutions will be training students, and all share the goal of expanding climate literacy in the US, emphasizing the role high latitudes play in the Earth's dynamic climate.<br/><br/>The main goal of the project is to improve estimates of sea ice production and water mass transformation in the Ross Sea. The team will fully capture the spatial and temporal changes in air-ice-ocean interactions when they are initiated in the austral fall, and then track the changes into the winter and spring using ice buoys, and airborne mapping with the newly commissioned IcePod instrument system, which is deployed on the US Antarctic Program's LC-130 fleet. The oceanographic cruise will include stations in and outside of both the Terra Nova Bay and Ross Ice Shelf polynyas. Measurements to be made include air-sea boundary layer fluxes of heat, freshwater, and trace gases, radiation, and meteorology in the air; ice formation processes, ice thickness, snow depth, mass balance, and ice drift within the sea ice zone; and temperature, salinity, and momentum in the ocean below. Following collection of the field data, the team will improve both model parameterizations of air-sea-ice interactions and remote sensing algorithms. Model parameterizations are needed to determine if sea-ice production has increased in crucial areas, and if so, why (e.g., stronger winds or fresher oceans).  The remote sensing validation will facilitate change detection over wider areas and verify model predictions over time.  Accordingly this project will contribute to the international Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) goal of measuring essential climate variables continuously to monitor the state of the ocean and ice cover into the future."

Once the analysis method is developed, the measurements will be used to examine why methane changed abruptly in the past, both during the last ice age, and during previous warm periods.  The data will be used to understand how methane sources like wildfires, methane hydrates, and wetlands respond to climate change. This information is needed to understand future risks of large changes in methane in the atmosphere as Earth warms. <br/><br/>The project involves two tasks.  First, the investigators will build and test a gas extraction system for methane isotopic measurements using continuous flow methods, with the goal of equaling or bettering the precision attained by the few other laboratories that make these measurements.  The system will be interfaced with existing mass spectrometers at Oregon State University. The system consists of a vacuum chamber and sequence of traps, purification columns, and furnaces that separate methane from other gases and convert it to carbon dioxide or hydrogen for mass spectrometry.  Second, the team will measure the isotopic composition of methane across large changes in concentration associated with two past interglacial periods and during abrupt methane changes of the last ice age.  These measurements will be used to understand if the main reason for these concentration changes is climate-driven changes in emissions from wetlands, or whether other sources are involved, for example methane hydrates or wildfires.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to determine if such a collapse occurred in the recent past. This will include development of new geochemical tools to evaluate the sedimentary geologic record around the WAIS to evaluate WAIS behavior during past warm periods.   The primary activities to be carried out by the research team are to: 1) characterize the chemistry and magnetic properties of sediments being discharged from different portions of the WAIS and use these properties to ?fingerprint? inputs from different sources on the continent; 2) measure these same properties in a marine sediment core to document major changes in the WAIS over the last 150,000 years. Determining if the WAIS has collapsed in the recent past can provide important information on WAIS potential to grow unstable in the future.   The tools to be developed here can then be used on older records around the WAIS to examine the frequency of ice sheet instability in the past. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher as well as undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project will develop sediment provenance proxies to trace the sources of sediment discharged by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) to the continental rise. Specific questions to be addressed are: 1) the degree that sediment from different WAIS terranes can be geochemically and magnetically differentiated; 2) the ability of terrane provenance proxies to detect WAIS collapse in the late Quaternary. The WAIS erodes sediments from various West Antarctic geologic terranes that are deposited in adjacent drift sites. The geochemistry and magnetic properties of drift sediments reflect the tectonic and metamorphic history of their source terranes. Deglaciation of a terrane during WAIS collapse should be detectable by the loss of the terrane?s geochemical and magnetic signature in continental-rise detrital sediments. Continental shelf late-Holocene sediments from near the current WAIS groundling line will be analyzed for silt- and clay-size Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, magnetic properties, and major-trace elements. The suite of cores includes  the eastern Ross Sea to the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and will establish provenance signatures of the Ross and Amundsen Provinces of Marie Byrd Land, Pine Island Bay, Thurston Island/Eight Coast Block, Ellsworth-Whitmore Crustal Block, and Antarctic Peninsula terranes. Many of these terranes have similar tectonic and metamorphic histories but Sr-Nd isotope data from detrital sediments suggest at least 3 distinct provenance signatures. An initial down core study of Ocean Drilling Program Site 1096 in the Bellingshausen Sea will be conducted to detect if the WAIS was unstable during the last interglacial period."

The third objective seeks to understand how marine animals can benefit from these compounds by consuming the algae that contain them, and then using those compounds to chemically deter predators. The field components of this research will be performed during three expeditions to the US Palmer Station, Antarctica. During these expeditions, a variety of laboratory feeding bioassays, manipulative field and laboratory experiments, and on-site chemical analyses will be performed. The investigators will also foster opportunities to integrate their NSF research with a variety of educational activities. As in the past they will support undergraduate research, both through NSF programs as well as home, university-based, programs, and they will also continue to support and foster graduate education. Through their highly successful University of Alabama in Antarctica interactive web program (two time recipient of awards of excellence from the US Council for Advancement and Support of Education), they will continue to involve large numbers of teachers, K-12 students, and other members of the community at large in their scientific endeavors in Antarctica. In addition, the investigators have hosted K-12 teachers on their Antarctic field teams through the former NSF Teachers Experiencing Antarctica and the Arctic program and will pursue participation in PolarTREC, the successor to this valuable program.

This project will focus on three main objectives which are a direct outcome of the past studies of the chemical ecology of shallow-water marine macroalgae and invertebrates on the Antarctic Peninsula by this group of investigators. The first objective is to expand the current understanding of a community-wide mutualism between macroalgae and their associated amphipods to include gastropods, which are also abundant on many macroalgae.

Some of these events could be dangerous affecting Earth's artificial satellites, damaging their instrumentation and disrupting communication with ground centers. The Earth's magnetic field has some specific regions where it exposes the upper atmosphere and ionosphere for all these impacts from outer space. The polar caps are specific areas around the geomagnetic poles, where geomagnetic field lines are open and directly interact with the interplanetary magnetic field (extended magnetic fields of the Sun). During strong geomagnetic disturbances, the polar caps increase their size, sometimes dramatically. Monitoring the Earth polar regions, ionospheric currents that flow over these regions, polar cap boundaries dynamics, etc., are important for space weather studies. Many geospace-monitoring stations are deployed over the northern polar cap and auroral zone on a regular basis, but the southern polar cap and auroral zone are left much behind due to enormous difficulties for people to reach the Antarctic and stay there. <br/><br/>Thus, a more holistic approach to the geospace research is needed for the Antarctic - the one that integrates clustered instrumentation at multiple locations to have a simultaneous look at the solar wind interactions within the entire Geospace system. This project will support studies of interrelated geospace phenomena observed at southern high latitudes through the coordinated and collaborative effort deploying and maintaining respective instrumentation at the U.S. Antarctic stations McMurdo, South Pole, and Palmer. The suite of geospace instrumentation at these stations has a sustained track-record of robust operation and community support: ground-based fluxgate and search-coils magnetometers, ELF and VLF receivers, imaging and broadband riometers, sky-looking optical systems, GPS scintillation-rated receivers, and several other instruments. Measurements collected from these instruments can be synergistically combined for the studies of synoptic variabilities of the magnetospheric open-closed boundary and associated cusp structures, understanding ELF whistler events and their relationship to ionospheric conditions, doing VLF diagnostics of magnetospheric conditions, and investigating the GPS signal scintillation occurrence and strength in relation to the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling processes. These topics are only a partial listing of the research effort that can be performed with the data obtained from the Antarctic geospace instruments, especially via the already established and planned collaborations with other geospace projects operating across Antarctica and at magnetically conjugate regions in the Arctic.

Following this short inflationary period, the Universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate. It is believed that this violent space-time expansion would have produced primordial gravitational waves now propagating through the expanding universe, thus forming a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB) the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and detecting this polarization signature is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today. <br/><br/>This award supports the development of a 150 GHz wide-field receiver for studying the CMB polarization as part of the BICEP Array multi-institutional experiment. The BICEP Array continues the BICEP program of CMB polarization measurements and will ultimately operate in six frequency bands at 30, 40, 95, 150, 220 and 270 GHz to measure and remove polarized emission from the Milky Way Galaxy and detect the long-sought primordial gravitational waves signal. The proposed MRI effort will: (a) provide a large leap in measurement capability at the critical 150 GHz frequency band as the new 150 GHz receiver will make CMB measurements 15 times more rapidly than a single Keck Array receiver in this band, representing the leading measurement capability at this frequency when fielded; (b) leverage NSF's current investment in developing the BICEP Array telescope mount, and its commitment to supporting BICEP Array logistics, fielding, operations, and data analysis through 2021; and (c) leverage existing private funding to construct 30/40 and 95 GHz receivers that will place tight constraints on galactic synchrotron emission at the appropriate level of sensitivity for the proposed 150 GHz instrument. This development is low-risk and incorporates significant technological advances reached recently with fabrication of larger detector arrays. The proposed BICEP Array program is a pathfinder towards the CMB-S4 initiative to build ultimate CMB polarization experiments, which will combine many (up to 5-10) CMB telescopes deployed at different locations."

The latter is important because calculating this index using existing Aural Electrojet (AE) technique (that uses data from 12 geomagnetic observatories across the Northern auroral region) is not applicable to the Southern auroral region that goes over Southern Ocean for ~50% of the global coverage. There are only 5-6 Antarctic costal research stations that can contribute to this index calculations, which is much less than optimal for the traditional AE calculation technique. This research effort has the potential to significantly increase our understanding of the role played by interhemispheric currents on the dynamics of the polar and auroral regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Taylor Valley is one of the Dry Valleys of the Transantarctic Mountains, which are characterized by low mean annual temperatures, low precipitation, and limited erosion.  These conditions have allowed fragile glacial landforms to be preserved for up to 15 Ma.  Sediment eroded and deposited by glaciers is found on the valley walls and floors, with progressively younger deposits preserved at lower elevations. Scientists can date glacial deposits to understand the process and timing of past glacial erosion.  Previous work in the Dry Valleys region suggested that extremely cold glaciers like Taylor Glacier, a major outlet glacier entering the valleys, were not erosive during the last several million years.  This research will test a new hypothesis that glacial erosion and sediment production beneath Taylor Glacier have been active in the last few million years.  This hypothesis will be tested using a new isotopic dating method called ""comminution dating' which determines when fine-grained sediment particles called silt were formed.  If the sediment age is young, then the results will suggest that glacial processes have been more dynamic than previously thought.  Overall, this study will increase our understanding of the nature and extent of past glaciations in Antarctica.  Because the silt produced by erosion sediment is a nutrient for local ecosystems, the results will also shed light on delivery of nutrients to soils, streams, and coastal zones in high polar regions.  This project will be led by an early career scientist and includes training of a Ph.D. student.  <br/><br/>Atechnical description of the project <br/><br/>There is a long-standing scientific controversy about the stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet with much evidence centered in the Dry Valleys region of South Victoria Land.  A prevailing view of geomorphologists is that the landscape has been very stable and that the effects of glaciation have been minimal for the past ~15 Ma.   This project will distinguish between two end-member scenarios of glacial erosion and deposition by Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that terminates in Taylor Valley in the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica.  In the first scenario, all valley relief is generated prior to 15 Ma when non-polar climates enabled warm-based glaciers to incise and widen ancient river channels. In this case, younger glacial deposits record advances of cold-based glaciers of decreasing ice volume and limited glacial erosion, and sediment generation resulted in glacial deposits composed primarily of older recycled sediments. In the second scenario, selective erosion of the valley floor has continued to deepen Taylor Valley but has not affected the adjacent peaks over the last 2 Ma. In this scenario, the ""bathtub rings"" of Quaternary glacial deposits situated at progressively lower elevations through time could be due to the lowering of the valley floor by subglacial erosion and with it, production of new sediment which is now incorporated into these deposits. While either scenario would result in the present-day topography, they differ in the implied evolution of regional glacial ice volume over time and the timing of both valley relief production and generation of fine-grained particles.  <br/><br/>The two scenarios will be tested by placing time constraints on fine particle production using U-series comminution dating. This new geochronologic tool exploits the loss of 234U due to alpha-recoil. The deficiency in 234U only becomes detectable in fine-grained particles with a sufficiently high surface-area-to-volume ratio which can incur appreciable 234U loss.  The timing of comminution and particle size controls the magnitude of 234U loss.  While this geochronologic tool is in its infancy, the scientific goal of this proposal can be achieved by resolving between ancient and recently comminuted fine particles, a binary question that the preliminary modeling and measured data show is readily resolved."

The goal of this project is to determine if such a collapse occurred in the recent past. This will include development of new geochemical tools to evaluate the sedimentary geologic record around the WAIS to evaluate WAIS behavior during past warm periods.   The primary activities to be carried out by the research team are to: 1) characterize the chemistry and magnetic properties of sediments being discharged from different portions of the WAIS and use these properties to ?fingerprint? inputs from different sources on the continent; 2) measure these same properties in a marine sediment core to document major changes in the WAIS over the last 150,000 years. Determining if the WAIS has collapsed in the recent past can provide important information on WAIS potential to grow unstable in the future.   The tools to be developed here can then be used on older records around the WAIS to examine the frequency of ice sheet instability in the past. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher as well as undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project will develop sediment provenance proxies to trace the sources of sediment discharged by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) to the continental rise. Specific questions to be addressed are: 1) the degree that sediment from different WAIS terranes can be geochemically and magnetically differentiated; 2) the ability of terrane provenance proxies to detect WAIS collapse in the late Quaternary. The WAIS erodes sediments from various West Antarctic geologic terranes that are deposited in adjacent drift sites. The geochemistry and magnetic properties of drift sediments reflect the tectonic and metamorphic history of their source terranes. Deglaciation of a terrane during WAIS collapse should be detectable by the loss of the terrane?s geochemical and magnetic signature in continental-rise detrital sediments. Continental shelf late-Holocene sediments from near the current WAIS groundling line will be analyzed for silt- and clay-size Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes, magnetic properties, and major-trace elements. The suite of cores includes  the eastern Ross Sea to the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and will establish provenance signatures of the Ross and Amundsen Provinces of Marie Byrd Land, Pine Island Bay, Thurston Island/Eight Coast Block, Ellsworth-Whitmore Crustal Block, and Antarctic Peninsula terranes. Many of these terranes have similar tectonic and metamorphic histories but Sr-Nd isotope data from detrital sediments suggest at least 3 distinct provenance signatures. An initial down core study of Ocean Drilling Program Site 1096 in the Bellingshausen Sea will be conducted to detect if the WAIS was unstable during the last interglacial period."

For example, on time scales of hundreds of years, coarse scale proxies indicate that the temperature of the North Atlantic region of the globe may change while the temperature of the South Atlantic region changes with the opposite sign.  Models of this ""bipolar seesaw"" invoke the long-distance transmission (teleconnection) of information through the atmosphere or the ocean.  The proposed work will use ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica to investigate the relative roles of oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections in coupling both hemispheres during so-called ""Heinrich events"" - massive discharges of icebergs into the North Atlantic that happed repeatedly during the last ice age. The work will help climate scientists understand dynamical changes that occur on times scales that are much longer than observational records from weather stations.  The project will also contribute to development of the STEM workforce.  It will provide support for an early-career scientist during the formative years of his career.  It will provide support for one or more undergraduate laboratory technicians and entrain undergraduates, supported through other sources, into the research.  It will include STEM outreach to local middle school students and a teacher training program.  It will result in a series of Wikipedia entries concerning paleoclimate.  As an ancillary benefit, it will improve the chronology of the Greenland ice core to be studied.  This will allow greater synchronization of paleoclimate records between the two poles and facilitate progress in the study of past climates.<br/><br/>The proposed work will generate high-resolution, high-precision records of Greenland (GISP2) ice core methane, 15N/14N ratio of molecular nitrogen, and air content for the period of 14-51 ka before present, to investigate a number of important paleoclimatic questions with a special focus on Heinrich stadials. The proposed work is organized under four overarching goals: (1) to detect the impact of Heinrich events on Greenland climate, and use the timing of these events relative to observed rapid Antarctic warming to investigate whether the mode of interhemispheric climate coupling during these events is via an atmospheric or an oceanic teleconnection; (2) to achieve interpolar methane synchronization of the GISP2 and WAIS Divide ice cores at unprecedented centennial-scale resolution, with applications in studying interhemispheric climate teleconnections and ice core dating.; (3) to provide the most accurate Greenland temperature reconstruction to date by combining nitrogen isotope data with independent delta-age estimates derived from the methane synchronization; and (4) to improve understanding of air content as a proxy for ice sheet elevation, and investigate origin of millennial-scale air content variations during Dansgaard-Oeschger events not previously described in the literature.

Most studies of patterns and processes responsible for vegetation change have focused on deciduous shrubs, which have shown increases in abundance throughout much of the Arctic.  Fewer studies have examined changes in tree abundance at the interface between arctic tundra and the boreal forest. This project will take advantage of historical aerial images collected throughout the Brooks Range during the 1950s and 1970s to provide a comprehensive census of changes in tree abundance in recent decades in northern Alaska. Investigators will also test hypotheses about whether differences in nutrition, colder soils, and more widespread permafrost explain why trees in the western Brooks Range have increased their growth in response to recent warming, while those in the eastern Brooks Range have not. In addition, the investigators plan extensive education and outreach activities in rural and urban Alaska. Rural efforts will include visiting classrooms in Kotzebue High School to share research results, providing opportunities for Kotzebue High School students to join the research team in the field, arrainging to be interviewed by local public radio stations, and delivering public lectures at National Park Service headquarters in several local villages. In Anchorage, the investigators plan to equip a public high school in Anchorage with supples needed to conduct tree-ring research, train students in standard methods, and help them design a study to link white spruce tree ring data in their backyards to long term climate records. <br/><br/>The relative abundance of forest and tundra has important implications for surface energy exchange, carbon cycling, wildlife habitat and the availability of subsistence resources at high latitudes. The northern limit of the boreal forest in Alaska is formed within the Brooks Range. The eastern Brooks Range is an area well known to dendrochronologists as an epicenter of divergent tree growth responses to climate warming. Divergence refers to the deterioration of historically strong positive correlations between temperature and tree growth. The recognition that divergence has been widespread in the circumboreal has undermined confidence in paleoclimate reconstructions and created uncertainty in projections of vegetation-climate feedbacks. While divergence is a well-known phenomenon, its implications for changes in tree abundance and shifts in treeline position remain unknown. Recent findings in four watersheds along a west to east gradient in the Brooks Range suggest colder, more permafrost-affected soils limit tree access to soil nutrients and may be the cause of divergence in the eastern Brooks Range.  In this study, investigators will expand the spatial extent of this previous work to examine the causes and consequences of divergence in the Brooks Range. They will combine repeat aerial photography with tree-ring analysis and detailed measurements of tree microclimates, mycorrhizal associations, nutrient relations, and reproductive effort in 25 Brooks Range watersheds to yield broad-scale mechanistic insights into controls on tree growth and changes in tree abundance in a changing climate. They will test the hypothesis that positive growth responses to warming and increased tree abundance will prevail in the western Brooks Range and in habitats with warmer soils, while neutral growth responses to warming and stagnant treelines will be common in the eastern Brooks Range and in areas with cold soils.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meaningful inclusion of Indigenous scholars and community members in the workshops makes the project more convergent in that it is not only transdisciplinary science but seeks out issues and information important to Arctic and mid-latitude Tribal communities. This project promotes convergence by addressing the societal concern of achieving resilience for Arctic communities and by integrating diverse fields of science through a complex systems approach and through engagement with Indigenous scholars and community members. The range of expertise represented by the participants includes ecosystem science, social science, climatology and system science."

In addition, it will immediately follow the regular workshop for West Antarctic Ice Sheet researchers, held in the same venue, thus allowing interdisciplinary interactions, and potentially minimizing travel costs for participants.  The timing might coincide with the release of the upcoming NRC report on future Antarctic research priorities.     The single-session meeting will be guided by a seven-member interdisciplinary organizing committee that will identify unifying session themes based on their knowledge of recent research, and community interest.  The scientific program will include invited presentations by established and early career scientists, contributed presentations, daily poster sessions and dedicated discussion time to promote exchange of ideas.  One longer term goal is to establish a regular forum for U.S. Antarctic scientists to disseminate research results and engage in interdisciplinary discussions.  In advance of the anticipated Shackleton Glacier logistics hub, the meeting would include a dedicated session to discuss logistics in the overall context of NSF Polar Programs, and will inform the community on the latest information from NSF and Antarctic Support Contract staff.<br/><br/>The meeting will include a focus on basic Antarctic Earth Science research, along with critical questions about Antarctica?s role in the global environment that impact human welfare.  The long term history of the Antarctic ice sheets is crucial to understanding the controls on sea level and global biogeochemical cycles.  To facilitate more effective translation of research findings, the meeting will also include a session on effective science communication to help all researchers improve their engagement with the public."

One goal of the proposed PCE-RCN will be to better understand the challenges associated with coastal erosion, which is driven by permafrost thaw and changing sea ice conditions. Another goal is to identify potential solutions and their socio-ecological impacts. These goals will be addressed through a series of international workshops, publications and direct interaction with local media. Engagement with regional and local resource managers and communities will be incorporated throughout many of the activities of the PCE-RCN. This project promotes convergence by focusing on a topic of high societal concern, coastal erosion in the Arctic, and by approaching this topic in a manner that will integrate diverse fields, including social science and natural science disciplines (coastal geophysics, soil physics, climate modelling, and atmospheric science) and disciplines in civil and environmental engineering. <br/><br/><br/>The proposed Permafrost Coastal Erosion-RCN (PCE-RCN) will bring together national and international leaders in the diverse scientific and engineering disciplines needed to address the pressing societal issue of rapid coastal erosion.

Arctic scientific research in and about communities depends in large part on collaborations, especially with local scholars and researchers, many of who are Arctic Indigenous people. The approach of this RCN stresses the interest and need for local and Indigenous researchers to meet in their homelands and design research network activities in locally and culturally relevant ways. This approach acknowledges that local Arctic Indigenous people are highly underrepresented in science, as are their practices and knowledge. This RCN recognizes this disparity and will document shared and best practices for collaboration and knowledge co-production between Arctic communities and scientific researchers to share with the broader Arctic scientific community.  <br/><br/>The RCN steering committee (SC) members are Indigenous men and women, including Elders, from communities and organizations across the Arctic. SC members also include visiting scientists and academics (both Indigenous and non-Indigenous) who work in collaboration with the community-based researchers. The network SC members are Shari Fox Gearheard (PI), Univ. of Colorado; Lene Kielsen Holm (Co-PI), Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; Henry Huntington (Co- PI), Huntington Consulting; Juha Feodoroff, Sevettijrvi, Finland; Veikko Feodoroff, Skolt Smi Village Committee, Finland; Bruce Forbes, Univ. of Lapland; Niore Iqalukjuak, Kangiqtugaapik, Nunavut; David Iqaqrialu, Kangiqtugaapik, Nunavut; Angunnguaq Josefsen, Kapisillit, Greenland; Petr Konstantinov, Yakutia, Russia; Evgenii Khudi, Yamal, Russia; Vittus Nielsen, Qoorngoq, Greenland; George Noongwook, Savoonga, Alaska; Margaret Opie, Barrow, Alaska; and Florian Stammler, Univ. of Lapland.  These researchers work in a variety of contexts, including collaborative research with visiting scientists, community-based and community-initiated research and monitoring programs, and projects of all sizes that employ both Indigenous knowledge as well as western scientific approaches.<br/><br/>The objectives of this network are to:<br/><br/>1) Exchange research expertise, experiences, and approaches from the different members of the network;<br/>2) Document those experiences and approaches that the members identify as ""best practices"" for community-based research in Indigenous communities (noting these locally, but also where these are shared across the different communities represented);<br/>3) Establish easily accessible means for network members to stay in contact between in-person meetings, sustain the network, and to welcome in new members (e.g. social media, regular meetings);<br/>4) Collaborate with and exchange expertise with other existing networks and organizations interested in Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous leadership in Arctic research and education, specifically the current ""Facilitating Indigenous Research, Science, and Technology (FIRST)"" RCN and the network member organizations including the Skolt Smi Village Committee and Skolt Cultural Foundation, the Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland, Piqqusilirivvik Inuit<br/>Cultural School and Nunavut Arctic College, and the Iupiat Heritage Center;<br/>5) Interact with graduate students, youth, and early-career scientists through their participation in network meetings, exchange at a major conference, and visits by network members to classes and student groups to share perspectives on working with Arctic Indigenous communities.<br/> <br/>The RCN will hold in-person workshops in Arctic locations so that network members have the opportunity to connect with one another in places that matter to them, giving context to the hosts' experiences and allowing the visitors to see directly and in situ what their hosts' research means to them and their communities. The project team's previous work has demonstrated that direct community-community exchange is ideal for maximizing knowledge and cultural exchange and facilitating true local leadership of meetings and research in their own ways, using their own approaches and methods. Early discussions within the RCN Steering Committee members indicate such approaches will include travel on the land, demonstration of and participation in traditional activities (e.g. herding, hunting, crafts-making), sharing of food, meetings between Elders and youth, and informal and formal discussions - i.e., the proposed RCN will not rely solely on standard scientific-style workshops or table-based meetings. Rather, exchanges and discussions will also happen while doing, and while respecting and learning about activities and ways of life in the homelands visited."

At the same time, satellite imagery and the geospatial tools being developed to explore it present novel opportunities for earth and environmental science education. The research objective of this five-year project is to use individual-based models of nest site occupancy, parameterized by sub-meter satellite imagery, to estimate the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in structuring the fine-scale spatial ecology of seabird colonies (biological process) and to understand how these within-colony dynamics drive habitat occupancy at regional scales (geographic pattern). This project involves three interconnected research activities: 1) the synthesis of manual and automated algorithms for satellite imagery interpretation, and the use of such methods to create a high-resolution, large extent database of penguin breeding occupancy from which species-specific habitat suitability models will be developed; 2) the construction and parameterization of a hierarchical (species-specific) stochastic spatially-realistic structured metapopulation model to study the processes of colony formation and collapse. These models, parameterized by the sub-meter satellite imagery, will elucidate how tipping points at the local-scale drive emergent dynamics at the metapopulation scale; and 3) the optimization of spatial and/or temporal metrics for 'critical slowing' as an indication of impending seabird colony collapse and, at larger spatial scales, regional extinction.<br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of this project center around the development of secondary-school earth and environmental science learning modules that integrate geography (content), geospatial technologies (process), and virtual access to Antarctica (context) into a unified framework for teaching key components of the New York State Core Curricula for science.

The goal of the workshop is to promote knowledge integration and to improve understanding of the relationships between knowledge co-production, international collaboration, and sustainable development in the Arctic from science, policy, and community perspectives. The proposed workshop would take place on September 18-20, 2017, immediately prior to the Arctic Council (AC) Sustainable Development Working Group's (SDWG) meeting (September 21-22, 2017).  The workshop has been organized to take place prior to the September SDWG meeting in order to facilitate the participation of SDWG member states representatives, Arctic Council Observer organization representatives, Permanent Participant representatives, as well as the AC science working group members. By scheduling the workshop in this way, it will provide for broader participation by key international policy makers, as well as scientists and Indigenous scholars. In addition, this will provide for an economy of scale since a number of the invited participants will already be supported by their organizations to participate in the SDWG meeting. The workshop will produce publicly available materials, which could be used for educational and knowledge dissemination purposes. These will include a final report documenting the essence of the presentations and discussions and a summary for policymakers.<br/><br/>During the Canadian Chairmanship of the AC, at the 9th Ministerial Meeting in Iqaluit, 2015, the SDWG made recommendations to the Senior Arctic Officials through the official delivery of the ""Recommendations for the Integration of Traditional and Local Knowledge into the Work of the Arctic Council."" In the two years since this event, the SDWG and AC have debated how exactly to implement these recommendations. There is wide recognition among the Arctic social science community, Indigenous and non-indigenous scholars, that the new developing model of knowledge co-production in science research could offer a model for assisting the AC in these efforts of the integration of Traditional Knowledge into its work. This workshop would be part of a broader effort between the Senior Arctic Officials of the Arctic Council and the Permanent Participants to find common ground on how to incorporate Traditional Knowledge into the proceedings of the Council.  <br/><br/>An important trend in Arctic sustainability research in the last decade is the increasing integration of the local and Indigenous knowledge as a key component of the Arctic sustainability knowledge system. Knowledge co-production has become the state-of-the-art in Arctic, and Arctic Indigenous scholars and communities are leading the way in developing co-production methodologies and formulating holistic, integrated approaches to understanding coupled and dynamic social-ecological systems. Engaging Indigenous knowledge in scholarship and policymaking is a monumental task that requires combined, collaborative efforts of Indigenous communities, social scientists and policymakers. Building connections and bridges by creating international, interdisciplinary knowledge exchange opportunities among allgroups involved is an important element of an interdisciplinary, integrated approach to sustainable development in the Arctic."

This is important in order to understand the impact of human activities on Earth's atmosphere, and to determine the stability of the composition of the atmosphere in the past. How humans have impacted Earth?s atmospheric composition is important for developing accurate predictions of future global atmospheric conditions. In addition to training students, the investigators will support continuing education of high school science teachers on Long Island through specifically tailored, interactive seminars on various topics in earth science, atmospheric sciences, physics and biology. A pilot program at Mount Sinai School District, near Stony Brook University will be the first implementation of this program.<br/><br/>The investigators plan to reconstruct historical variations in the sources of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) from measurements of the concentration and stable isotopic abundance of carbon monoxide ([CO], 13CO and C18O) in the South Pole Ice Core, which is being drilled in 2014-2016. The goal is to strategically sample and reconstruct the relative variations in CO source strengths over the past 20,000 years. These will be the first measurements to extend the CO record beyond 650 years before present, back to the last glacial maximum. Both atmospheric chemical processes and variations in CO sources can impact the CO budget, and variations in the CO budget are useful in identifying and quantifying chemistry-climate interactions."

Because of the complex interactions and feedbacks among physical, biogeochemical and ecological processes in the Arctic, there is significant uncertainty regarding how these changes in sea ice will impact the marine biological pump, which fuels the rich bottom communities on Arctic ocean shelves and is key to the regional carbon cycle. While responses of the biological pump to increased light availability in spring are currently being pursued, a considerable gap in knowledge exists regarding biological processes in the late summer and early fall. Recent studies indicate a several-decade trend of intensifying wind forcing over the Alaskan margin along the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the late, ice-free season (September-November). These events could lead to mixing of nutrients into surface waters, fueling increased biological production and sequestering additional carbon into shelf bottom waters prior to the winter ice advance. However, the lack of direct, concurrent observations of primary and net community productivity rates, and nutrient and carbon distributions during this poorly-sampled time of year hinders efforts to assess the ecosystem implications of such changes. This project proposes to address the question of increasing biological production in the late season through intensive field sampling in two successive years.<br/><br/>The investigators will use an innovative approach to better characterize how primary productivity (PP), net community productivity (NCP), and particulate and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon stocks (POC, DOC, DIC) are influenced by episodic nutrient inputs to the surface ocean in late summer and early fall. Over two field campaigns, they will collect high resolution surface measurements of dissolved gases, particulate and dissolved organic matter stocks and dissolved inorganic nutrients and carbon using a ship of opportunity (year 1) and dedicated research cruises (year 2). The use of geochemical rate tracers (oxygen/argon-based NCP and oxygen isotope-based PP; inventory changes of POC, DOC, nutrients, and DIC) offers a distinct advantage over incubation-based approaches by integrating processes on longer timescales (weekly to monthly). This approach is well-suited to capture the effects of episodic upwelling and subsequent ecosystem processing. On the dedicated regional research cruises in year 2 the investigators will also use a towed pumping sled to capture high-resolution vertical and cross-shelf observations. This towed sled will be equipped with standard CTD and optical sensors and interfaced to fast shipboard analyzers for measurement of nutrients and inorganic carbon (pCO2, DIC), as well as to automated samplers to collect water for oxygen/argon ratios, oxygen isotope, POC and DOC measurements. High-resolution chemical and biological distributions will be combined with ship-based ADCP measurements of water column velocities and continuity-based mass-balance calculations to constrain rates of NCP as well as the extent of vertical and lateral material fluxes. Outreach and education elements include a pilot program to engage pre-service secondary STEM teachers in educational planning and field work portions of the work. The program will provide field experience and on the job science training to teachers and result in short media outreach pieces and targeted curriculum addressing the three dimensions of science from the next generation science standards. The proposal will support one graduate student and several undergraduate students, who will participate in all aspects of the field and analytical work. The project will contribute to the early career development of a junior investigator."

There is concern that rapid changes at these ice shelves can destabilize parts of the ice sheet and accelerate their contribution to sea-level rise.  The goal of this project is to understand and simulate the fracture mechanics of calving and to develop physically-consistent calving schemes for ice-sheet models.  This would enable more reliable estimation of Antarctic mass loss by reducing the uncertainty in projections.  The research plan is integrated with an education and outreach plan that aims to (1) enhance computational modeling skills of engineering and Earth science students through a cross-college course and a high-performance computing workshop and (2) increase participation and diversity in engineering and sciences by providing interdisciplinary research opportunities to undergraduates and by deploying new cyberlearning tools to engage local K-12 students in the Metro Nashville Public Schools in computational science and engineering, and glaciology.<br/><br/>This project aims to provide fundamental understanding of iceberg calving by advancing the frontiers in computational fracture mechanics and nonlinear continuum mechanics and translating it to glaciology.  The project investigates crevasse propagation using poro-damage mechanics models for hydrofracture that are consistent with nonlinear viscous ice rheology, along with the thermodynamics of refreezing in narrow crevasses at meter length scales. It will develop a fracture-physics based scheme to better represent calving in ice-sheet models using a multiscale method. The effort will also address research questions related to calving behavior of floating ice shelves and glaciers, with the goal of enabling more reliable prediction of calving fronts in whole-Antarctic ice-sheet simulations over decadal-to-millennial time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a Yup'ik scientist, PI Dr. Kristen Barnett, understands first-hand how college campuses are critical environments for providing Indigenous students with a pathway to  science careers, yet Alaska Native youth have limited participation and face limited support at institutions of higher learning.   Barnett points out that scientific research frequently focuses on topics that directly affect Indigenous communities, e.g., coastal erosion, permafrost, fisheries, the digital economy, and could benefit by incorporating Indigenous experiences and epistemologies into the science curricula at academic institutions.  The vision for this workshop, Tuyyuryaq (Togiak, Alaska), is to develop new models for improving the learning environment for Indigenous students on college campuses, as well as ways in which faculty can reenvision academic institutions and the ways in which they impart knowledge to Indigenous students and communities. Creating opportunities for Alaska Native and Native American students is strongly in the national interest; these groups are highly underrepresented in higher education and in science disciplines in particular.  Increasing the participation of these groups can provide leadership and economic opportunity in regions of the U.S. where opportunities for development are currently limited. <br/><br/>Paragraph 2: <br/>This workshop seeks to overcome structural inequalities in higher education and for indigenous students in particular, by developing and applying inclusive epistemologies derived from multiple cultures. The workshop provides a platform for collaborative participation accommodating a wide range of Indigenous communities, interdisciplinary scholars, students, administration and staff, and the general public.  The workshop will consists of an opening plenary session, followed by multiple small group sessions that facilitate immersive and sensitive discussions among participants, and concludes with a larger group discussion that highlights conference experiences, ideas and future directions. Participants will access tools for curriculum development and deepen their understanding of impacts of the current (western) educational models. The long-term goals of this workshop is to advance awareness and support the incorporation of inclusive practices of research and teaching, to encourge student involvement in campus culture that is scalable to any institution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to identify cellular responses in sea-ice algae to increasing temperature and decreasing salinity during the spring melt along the western Antarctic Peninsula and to determine how associated changes at the cellular level can potentially affect dynamic, biologically driven processes. Understanding how sea-ice algae cope with, and are adapted to, their environment will not only help predict how polar ecosystems may change as the extent and thickness of sea ice change, but will also provide a better understanding of the widespread success of photosynthetic life on Earth. The scientific context and resulting advances from the research will be communicated to the general public through outreach activities that includes work with Science Communication Fellows and the popular Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, Washington. The project will provide student training to college students as well as provide for educational experiences for K-12 school children. <br/><br/><br/>There is currently a poor understanding of feedback relationships that exist between the rapidly changing environment in the western Antarctic Peninsula region and sea-ice algal production. The large shifts in temperature and salinity that algae experience during the spring melt affect critical cellular processes, including rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involved in photosynthesis and respiration, and the production of stress-protective compounds. These changes in cellular processes are poorly constrained but can be large and may have impacts on local ecosystem productivity and biogeochemical cycles. In particular, this study will focus on the thermal sensitivity of enzymes and the cycling of compatible solutes and exopolymers used for halo- and cryo-protection, and how they influence primary production and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. Approaches will include field sampling during spring melt, incubation experiments of natural sea-ice communities under variable temperature and salinity conditions, and controlled manipulation of sea-ice algal species in laboratory culture. Employment of a range of techniques, from fast repetition rate fluorometry and gross and net photosynthetic measurements to metabolomics and enzyme kinetics, will tease apart the mechanistic effects of temperature and salinity on cell metabolism and primary production with the goal of quantifying how these changes will impact biogeochemical processes along the western Antarctic Peninsula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The discovery of proteorhodopsins in many diverse marine prokaryotic microbes has initiated extensive investigation into their distributions and functional roles.  Recently, a proton-pumping, rhodopsin-like gene was identified in diatoms, a group of marine phytoplankton that dominates the base of the food web in much of the Southern Ocean. Since this time, proteorhodopsins have been identified in many, but not all, diatom species.  The proteorhodopsin gene is more frequently found in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean, including the Southern Ocean, than in diatoms from other regions. It is thought that proteorhodopsin is especially suited for use energy production in the Southern Ocean since it uses no iron and its reaction rate is insensitive to temperature (unlike conventional photosynthesis). The overall objective of the project is to characterize Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin and determine its role in the adaptation of these diatoms to low iron concentrations and extremely low temperatures found in Antarctic waters. This research will provide new information on the genetic underpinnings that contribute to the success of diatoms in the Southern Ocean and how this unique molecule may play a pivotal role in providing energy to the base of the Antarctic food web.   Broader impact activities are aimed to promote the teaching and learning of polar marine-sciences related topics by translating research objectives into readily accessible educational materials for middle-school students.<br/><br/>This project will combine molecular, biochemical and physiological measurements to determine the role and importance of proteorhodopsin in diatom isolates from the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Proton-pumping characteristics and pumping rates of proteorhodopsin as a function of light intensity and temperature, the resultant proteorhodopsin-linked intracellular ATP production rates, and the cellular localization of the protein will be determined. The project will examine the environmental conditions where Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin is most highly expressed and construct a cellular energy budget that includes diatom-proteorhodopsin when grown under these different environmental conditions.  Estimates of the energy flux generated by proteorhodopsin will be compared to total energy generation by the photosynthetic light reactions and metabolically coupled respiration rates. Finally, the characteristics and gene expression of diatom-proteorhodopsin in Antarctic diatoms and a proteorhodopsin-containing diatom isolates from temperate regions will be compared in order to determine if there is a preferential dependence on energy production through proteorhodopsin in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean. Educational activities will be performed in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center who co-ordinates the SciVentures program, a popular summer camp for middle-school students from Chapel Hill and surrounding areas.

The discovery of proteorhodopsins in many diverse marine prokaryotic microbes has initiated extensive investigation into their distributions and functional roles.  Recently, a proton-pumping, rhodopsin-like gene was identified in diatoms, a group of marine phytoplankton that dominates the base of the food web in much of the Southern Ocean. Since this time, proteorhodopsins have been identified in many, but not all, diatom species.  The proteorhodopsin gene is more frequently found in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean, including the Southern Ocean, than in diatoms from other regions. It is thought that proteorhodopsin is especially suited for use energy production in the Southern Ocean since it uses no iron and its reaction rate is insensitive to temperature (unlike conventional photosynthesis). The overall objective of the project is to characterize Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin and determine its role in the adaptation of these diatoms to low iron concentrations and extremely low temperatures found in Antarctic waters. This research will provide new information on the genetic underpinnings that contribute to the success of diatoms in the Southern Ocean and how this unique molecule may play a pivotal role in providing energy to the base of the Antarctic food web.   Broader impact activities are aimed to promote the teaching and learning of polar marine-sciences related topics by translating research objectives into readily accessible educational materials for middle-school students.<br/><br/>This project will combine molecular, biochemical and physiological measurements to determine the role and importance of proteorhodopsin in diatom isolates from the Western Antarctic Peninsula region. Proton-pumping characteristics and pumping rates of proteorhodopsin as a function of light intensity and temperature, the resultant proteorhodopsin-linked intracellular ATP production rates, and the cellular localization of the protein will be determined. The project will examine the environmental conditions where Antarctic diatom-proteorhodopsin is most highly expressed and construct a cellular energy budget that includes diatom-proteorhodopsin when grown under these different environmental conditions.  Estimates of the energy flux generated by proteorhodopsin will be compared to total energy generation by the photosynthetic light reactions and metabolically coupled respiration rates. Finally, the characteristics and gene expression of diatom-proteorhodopsin in Antarctic diatoms and a proteorhodopsin-containing diatom isolates from temperate regions will be compared in order to determine if there is a preferential dependence on energy production through proteorhodopsin in diatoms residing in cold, iron-limited regions of the ocean. Educational activities will be performed in collaboration with the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center who co-ordinates the SciVentures program, a popular summer camp for middle-school students from Chapel Hill and surrounding areas.  In collaboration with the Planetarium, the researchers will develop activities that focus on phytoplankton and the important role they play within polar marine food webs for the SciVentures participants.

The abundance of oxidants such as ozone in the atmosphere strongly influences the concentrations of pollutants and greenhouse gases, with implications for human health and welfare. Because oxidants are not preserved in geological archives, knowledge of how oxidants have varied in the past under changing climate conditions is extremely limited.  This award will measure a proxy for oxidant concentrations in a West Antarctic ice core over several major climate transitions over the past 50,000 years.  These measurements will complement similar measurements from a Greenland ice core, which showed significant changes in atmospheric oxidants over major climate transitions covering this same time period.  The addition of measurements from Antarctica will allow researchers to examine if the oxidant changes suggested by the Greenland ice core record are regional or global in scale.  Knowledge of how oxidants vary naturally with climate will better inform predictions of the composition of the future atmosphere under a warming climate.<br/><br/>This award will support measurements of the isotopic composition of nitrate in a West Antarctic ice core as a proxy for oxidant concentrations in the past atmosphere.  The nitrogen isotopes of nitrate provide information on the degree of preservation of nitrate in the ice core record, and thus aid in the interpretation of the observed variability in the observed nitrate concentrations and oxygen isotopes in ice core records.  By providing information about the spatial scale of oxidant changes over abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period, this project may also improve our understanding of mechanisms driving these abrupt events.  Insight from this project will prove valuable for forecasting the response of stratospheric circulation to climate change, which has large implications for climate feedbacks and tropospheric composition.  In addition, the information gleaned from this project on the mechanisms and feedbacks during abrupt climate change events will help determine the likelihood of such rapid events occurring in the future, which would have dramatic impacts on humankind.  This award will provide training for one graduate and one undergraduate student, and will support the development of a hands-on activity related to rapid climate change to be used at the annual Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA."

The focus is on the Athabascan villages of Beaver and Artic where many elders who have lived a subsistence lifestyle reside. Studying Gwich'in forestry management in the Gwich'in language will provide an understanding of the human-environment interaction as a way to create more opportunities for co-management. This project will advance knowledge about forestry management for natural resources managers, and add to the growing body of regional work to promote Indigenous knowledge practice and sustainable management of natural resources. While this project incorporates ideas as well as approaches from current forestry and languages projects, it is also creating new information. This information will provide reliable/tested forestry practices for those interested in the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge into natural resources management, and will be shared with other villages. The opportunity to establish a Gwich'in forestry practices approach is missing in co-management as well as adaptive management between Indigenous and non-Indigenous agencies. Using management as one of the focal points of this project, the project will document the endangered Gwich'in language in a manner that is not archival, but alive.  <br/><br/>This project represents the application of a newly developed model for research, the co-production of scientific knowledge, bringing established forestry management science research together with Gwich'in knowledge holders in order to produce a more contextualized and holistic understanding of the boreal forest. The study will be the first to document Gwich'in forestry practices in a collaborative social and linguistic science investigation. Considered an endangered language, Gwich'in elders who are both fluent speakers and have lived a subsistence lifestyle will be interviewed in the Gwich'in language as a means to communicate complex seasonal management practices of the boreal forests. For this study, language is the vehicle to understand the deep place-based relationship Gwich'in people have with the forests. The core research question centers not only on how Gwich'in people practice forestry management but also on how their relationship to the forests change or evolve seasonally. While this project will not exhaust the discussion, the intention is to accomplish three objectives: 1. Demonstrate the usefulness of Gwich'in forestry knowledge and practices, 2. Record Gwich'in in this context and, 3. Provide a way forward in the co-management of the Alaska's interior boreal forests. Given the objectives, the potential contributions and implications of this study span a number of natural resources co-management opportunities: fire suppression and arctic boreal encroachment, as well as environmental change preparation-adaptation-mitigation."

This study is highly significant, addressing directly the research needs identified by Alaska Native, Yup'ik communities.  The previous NSF funded projects led by the same core team have been very successful with more than 10 major, well reviewed and well received, volumes published, including the critically acclaimed books: ""Stories for Future Generations / Qulirat Qanemcit-llu Kinguvarcimalriit;""  ""Yuungnaqpiallerput / The Way We Genuinely Live Masterworks of Yup'ik Science and Survival;"" and ""Ellavut / Our Yup'ik World and Weather: Continuity and Change on the Bering Sea Coast.""  In addition, this methodology has created strong community/science collaborations and the co-production of valuable knowledge to both scientists and community member.  The research teams have been very interdisciplinary, including anthropologists and Yup'ik scholars, as well as other scientists e.g., geologists, archaeologists, biologist, and physicists. <br/><br/>Collaboration, as the PI states, is the hallmark of this project, which builds on past partnerships between the scientific community and the Yup?ik community.  The project will engage institutional partners and Yup?ik collaborators from 23 communities in southwest Alaska.   The primary information-gathering tool will be a series of gatherings held both in local communities and the regional center of Bethel.   The research team and CEC staff pioneered this format working with elders a decade ago and have found that meetings with small groups of elder experts, younger community members and non-Native scientists for two-three-day gatherings devoted to a specific topic is a very effective means of both documenting traditional knowledge and addressing scientific questions.  Unlike interviews, during which elders answer questions posed by those who often do not hold the knowledge they seek, gatherings encourage elders to speak among their peers at the highest, most complex level.  The CEC method of elder gatherings in which scientists participate has been a very successful way of supporting the co-production of knowledge important not only for deeper understanding of key social and environmental issues of great interest in the region, and also for informing the public, resource managers, policy makers, and other stakeholders of the importance of these issues the region and beyond."

This places today's concentration of 400 parts per million in stark contrast.  Furthermore, these gas records show that natural sources of greenhouse gas such as oceans and ecosystems act as amplifiers of climate change by increasing emissions of gases during warmer periods.  Such amplification is expected to occur in the future, adding to the human-produced gas burden.  The South Pole ice core will build upon these prior findings by expanding the suite of gases to include, for the first time, those potent trace gases that both trapped heat and depleted ozone during the past 40,000 years.  The present project on inert gases and methane in the South Pole ice core will improve the dating of this crucial record, to unprecedented precision, so that the relative timing of events can be used to learn about the mechanism of trace gas production and destruction, and consequent climate change amplification.  Ultimately, this information will inform predictions of future atmospheric chemical cleansing mechanisms and climate in the context of our rapidly changing atmosphere.  This award also engages young people in the excitement of discovery and polar research, helping to entrain the next generations of scientists and educators.  Education of graduate students, a young researcher (Buizert), and training of technicians, will add to the nation?s human resource base.   <br/> <br/>This award funds the construction of the gas chronology for the South Pole 1500m ice core, using measured inert gases (d15N and d40Ar--Nitrogen and Argon isotope ratios, respectively) and methane in combination with a next-generation firn densification model that treats the stochastic nature of air trapping and the role of impurities on densification.  The project addresses fundamental gaps in scientific understanding that limit the accuracy of gas chronologies, specifically a poor knowledge of the controls on ice-core d15N and the possible role of layering and impurities in firn densification.  These gaps will be addressed by studying the gas enclosure process in modern firn at the deep core site.  The work will comprise the first-ever firn air pumping experiment that has tightly co-located measurements of firn structural properties on the core taken from the same borehole.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the lock-in horizon as defined by firn air d15N, CO2, and methane is structurally controlled by impermeable layers, which are in turn created by high-impurity content horizons in which densification is enhanced.  Thermal signals will be sought using the inert gas measurements, which improve the temperature record with benefits to the firn densification modeling.  Neon, argon, and oxygen will be measured in firn air and a limited number of deep core samples to test whether glacial period layering was enhanced, which could explain low observed d15N in the last glacial period.  Drawing on separate volcanic and methane synchronization to well-dated ice cores to create independent ice and gas tie points, independent empirical estimates of the gas age-ice age difference will be made to check the validity of the firn densification model-inert gas approach to calculating the gas age-ice age difference.  These points will also be used to test whether the anomalously low d15N seen during the last glacial period in east Antarctic ice cores is due to deep air convection in the firn, or a missing impurity dependence in the firn densification models.  <br/><br/>The increased physical understanding gained from these studies, combined with new high-precision measurements, will lead to improved accuracy of the gas chronology of the South Pole ice core, which will enhance the overall science return from this gas-oriented core.  This will lead to clarification of timing of atmospheric gas variations and temperature, and aid in efforts to understand the biogeochemical feedbacks among trace gases.  These feedbacks bear on the future response of the Earth System to anthropogenic forcing.  Ozone-depleting substances will be measured in the South Pole ice core record, and a precise gas chronology will add value.  Lastly, by seeking a better understanding of the physics of gas entrapment, the project aims to have an impact on ice-core science in general."

This information will provide reliable/tested forestry practices for those interested in the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge into natural resources management, and will be shared with other villages. The opportunity to establish a Gwich'in forestry practices approach is missing in co-management as well as adaptive management between Indigenous and non-Indigenous agencies. Using management as one of the focal points of this project, the project will document the endangered Gwich'in language in a manner that is not archival, but alive.  <br/><br/>This project represents the application of a newly developed model for research, the co-production of scientific knowledge, bringing established forestry management science research together with Gwich'in knowledge holders in order to produce a more contextualized and holistic understanding of the boreal forest. The study will be the first to document Gwich'in forestry practices in a collaborative social and linguistic science investigation. Considered an endangered language, Gwich'in elders who are both fluent speakers and have lived a subsistence lifestyle will be interviewed in the Gwich'in language as a means to communicate complex seasonal management practices of the boreal forests. For this study, language is the vehicle to understand the deep place-based relationship Gwich'in people have with the forests. The core research question centers not only on how Gwich'in people practice forestry management but also on how their relationship to the forests change or evolve seasonally. While this project will not exhaust the discussion, the intention is to accomplish three objectives: 1. Demonstrate the usefulness of Gwich'in forestry knowledge and practices, 2. Record Gwich'in in this context and, 3. Provide a way forward in the co-management of the Alaska's interior boreal forests. Given the objectives, the potential contributions and implications of this study span a number of natural resources co-management opportunities: fire suppression and arctic boreal encroachment, as well as environmental change preparation-adaptation-mitigation."

The PI and research team from Oberlin College proposes to do this through a participatory methodology that creates a collaboration between community members from Africatown (Plateau), Alabama and Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska and the Oberlin research team.   It is the research teams' thesis that the transmission of knowledge, inter-generationally, is key to long-term community resilience in response to rapid environmental and social change.  Among African American communities, represented in this workshop by the residents of Africatown, this knowledge transmission often takes the form of storytelling and among Alaska Native communities, represented by residents of Utqiagvik, this transmission is of Traditional Knowledge.   By understanding the relationship between resilience and storytelling and traditional knowledge the research team proposes that community can be strengthened even when facing extreme environmental events such as, sea level rise and storm surge flooding or social, economic, and technological events such as, job loss due to globalization or the BP oil spill.  It is the idea of the research team that by collaborating closely with the communities in co-producing knowledge through this workshop on resilience in the face of rapid change they will be able to identify key elements of the social and cultural systems that can ensure the long-term health and well-being of many communities.<br/> <br/>Although Africatown and Utqiagvik are geographically disparate communities they share similar challenges to their resilience in response to environmental and social-economic change.  The PIs will hold the workshop in Africatown, Alabama that will train local community members and their collaborators from Utqiagvik, Alaska in social science methods and practices.  The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program at the University of Florida has been engaged to train all workshop participants, including Oberlin students and researchers, in best practices, methods, and ethics of community oral history, storytelling and traditional knowledge.   Using a model of knowledge co-production in science, community members and researchers will work together to define the research questions, choose the methodologies, and create the analytic framework that will ultimately be turned into a long-term, community based research project.  Undergraduate students from Oberlin College will participate in trainings and in the ongoing work of oral history. In recruiting students, the research team has particularly focused on students underrepresented in STEM, including students of color, women, and first-generation college students. The conference will highlight how local knowledge embedded in oral history and cultural traditions can offer responses to contemporary challenges."

However, the PIs? recent work in the Arctic with white spruce suggests that indirect effects of temperature on soil nutrient availability may be of equal or greater importance.  They hypothesize that cold soils at the treeline, particularly during winter, limit microbial activity and nutrient availability to the point where trees are barely able to survive and grow.  Measurements made during winter have revealed that Arctic forests maintain snowpacks that are much deeper than observed at treeline.  Trees are thought to trap snow and lead to a deeper snowpack, insulating the soil from cold air and allowing for greater overwinter microbial activity and greater nutrient mineralization.  Indeed, the PIs found a strong positive correlation between white spruce growth and winter snow depth.  They propose to isolate the mechanisms underlying this correlation by using snowfences to manipulate winter snow depth and fertilizer to increase soil nutrient availability at three treelines that differ in soil moisture.  To provide an experimental test of the importance of temperature as a direct control on treeline tree growth, they propose to incorporate experimental shoot warming into their snowfence experiment in a factorial design.  They predict that both experimental snow and nutrient additions will lead to large increases in microbial activity, photosynthesis, tree growth, seed quality, seed production, seedling establishment and recruitment of new trees.  They expect to observe the greatest positive responses where soils are wet and cold. Meanwhile, they predict that shoot warming will lead to negligible changes in growth."

The SZ is a 5-10 km wide strip of heavily crevassed ice that separates the McMurdo and Ross ice shelves, and is an important region of lateral support for the Ross Ice Shelf. Previous radar and remote sensing studies reveal an enigmatic picture of the SZ in which crevasses detected at depth have no apparent surface expression, and have orientations which are possibly inconsistent with the observed flow field. In the proposed work, we seek to test the hypothesis that the SZ is a zone of chaotic Lagrangian mixing with (intersecting) buried crevasses which leads to rheological instability, potentially allowing large scale velocity discontinuities. The work will involve detailed field-based observations of crevasse distributions and structure using ground-penetrating radar, and GPS and remote sensing observations of the flow and stress field in the SZ. Because of the hazardous nature of the SZ, the radar surveys will be conducted largely with the aid of a lightweight robotic vehicle. Observations will be used to develop a finite element model of ice shelf shear margin behavior.  The intellectual merit of this project is an increased understanding of ice shelf shear margin dynamics. Shear margins play a key role in ice shelf stability, and ice shelves in turn modulate the flux of ice from the ice sheet across the grounding line to the ocean. Insights from this project will improve large-scale models being developed to predict ice sheet evolution and future rates of sea level rise, which are topics of enormous societal concern.  The broader impacts of the project include an improved basis for US Antarctic Program logistics planning as well as numerous opportunities to engage K-12 students in scientific discovery. Intensified crevassing in the shear zone between the Ross and McMurdo ice shelves would preclude surface crossing by heavy traverse vehicles which would lead to increased costs of delivering fuel to South Pole and a concomitant loss of flight time provided by heavy-lift aircraft for science missions on the continent. Our multidisciplinary research combining glaciology, numerical modeling, and robotics engineering is an engaging way to show how robotics can assist scientists in collecting hazardous field measurements. Our outreach activities will leverage Dartmouth's current NSF GK-12 program, build on faculty-educator relationships established during University of Maine's recent GK-12 program, and incorporate project results into University of Maine's IDEAS initiative, which integrates computational modeling with the existing science curriculum at the middle school level.

Recent observations, compared to observations made 20-30 years before, indicate that both ice shelves (thick ice with ocean below) and land ice (thick ice with land below), are now melting at a much faster rate. Some numerical models suggest that significant ice retreat may begin within many of our lifetimes, starting with the abrupt collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers in the next 50 years. This may be followed by retreat of much of the WAIS and then the collapse of parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS). This research project will assess the extent to which global ocean circulation and climate will be impacted if enormous volumes of fresh water and ice flow into the Southern Ocean. It will establish whether a rapid collapse of WAIS in the near-future poses any significant threat to the stability of modern-day climate and human society. This is a topic that has so far received little attention as most prior research has focused on the response of climate to melting the Greenland ice sheet. Yet model simulations predict that the volumes of fresh water and ice released from Antarctica in the next few centuries could be up at least ten-times larger than from Greenland. The Intellectual Merit of this project stems from its ability to establish a link between the physical Antarctic system (ice sheet dynamics, fresh water discharge and iceberg calving) and global climate. The PIs (Principal Investigators) will assess the sensitivity of ocean circulation and climate to increased ice sheet melt using a combination of ocean, iceberg, ice sheet and climate models. Results from this study will help identify areas of the ice sheet that are vulnerable to collapse and also regions of the ocean where a significant freshening will have a considerable impact on climate, and serve to guide the deployment of an observational monitoring system capable of warning us when ice and fresh water discharge start to approach levels capable of disrupting ocean circulation and global climate. This project will support and train two graduate students, and each PI will be involved with local primary and secondary schools, making presentations, mentoring science fair projects, and contributing to curriculum development. A novel, web-based, interactive, cryosphere learning tool will be developed to help make school children more aware of the importance of the Polar Regions in global climate, and this software will be introduced to science teachers at a half day workshop organized by the UMass STEM Education Institute. <br/><br/>Recent numerical simulations using a continental ice sheet/shelf model show the potential for more rapid and greater Antarctic ice sheet retreat in the next 50-300 years (under the full range of IPCC RCP (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Representative Concentration Pathways) future warming scenarios) than previously projected. Exactly how the release of enormous volumes of ice and fresh water to the Southern Ocean will impact global ocean circulation and climate has yet to be accurately assessed. This is in part because previous model simulations were too coarse to accurately resolve narrow coastal boundary currents, shelf breaks, fronts, and mesoscale eddies that are all very important for realistically simulating fresh water transport in the ocean. In this award, future projections of fresh water discharge and iceberg calving from Antarctic will be used to force a high resolution eddy-resolving ocean model (MITgcm) coupled to a new iceberg module and a fully-coupled global climate model (CCSM4). High resolution ocean/iceberg simulations will determine the role of mesoscale eddies in freshwater transport and give new insight into how fresh water is advected to far-field locations, including deep water formation sites in the North Atlantic. These simulations will provide detailed information about subsurface temperatures and changes in ocean circulation close to the ice front and grounding line. An accompanying set of fully coupled climate model simulations (NCAR CCSM4) will identify multidecadal-to-centennial changes in the climate system triggered by increased high-latitude Southern Ocean freshwater forcing. Particular attention will be given to changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), wind stress, sea ice formation, and global temperatures. In doing so, this project will more accurately determine whether abrupt and potentially catastrophic changes in global climate are likely to be triggered by changes in the Antarctic system in the near-future."

This will be accomplished both by analyzing the (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate) WACCM simulated surface mass balance, and by performing a series of sensitivity simulations with a stand-alone ice sheet model (the Ice Sheet System Model, or ISSM) forced by WACCM output.

Projected changes in Antarctic surface mass balance, sea ice extent, and surface temperature differ widely amongst current-generation climate models. Such uncertainties likely have roots in the mean states (climatologies) of different models. Recent observational and modeling evidence has implicated ocean mean-state biases in particular for the general inability of climate models to simulate trends in annual Antarctic sea ice extent observed by remote sensing. Ocean biases may be driven in part by a long-standing bias in absorbed shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean. The primary project goal is to systematically assess the influence of long-standing atmospheric radiation and ocean structure biases on the modelled climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, using a state-of-the-art community climate model (CESM). It is anticipated that the mean state (climatology) bias reductions will alter the response of sea ice extent and volume, air temperature, precipitation, surface mass balance, and sea level rise to anthropogenic forcing. Proposed climate modeling experiments,  together with existing numerical simulation experiments, will enable a more thorough and systematic assessment of the impact of mean-state biases on the simulation of climate variability and change across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean than has been previously possible."

Ongoing discovery of viruses seems to confirm current understanding that all forms of life can host and be infected by viruses and that viruses are one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth. This study aims to better understand interactions between specific viruses and phytoplankton hosts and determine how these viruses may affect different algal groups present within lakes of the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica.   These lakes (Ace, Organic and Deep)were originally derived from the ocean and contain a broad range of saline conditions with a similarly broad range of physicochemical characteristics resulting from isolation and low external influence for thousands of years.   These natural laboratories allow examination of microbial processes and interactions that would be difficult to characterize elsewhere on earth. The project will generate extensive genomic information that will be made freely available. The project will also leverage the study of viruses and the genomic approaches employed to advance the training of undergraduate students and to engage and foster an understanding of Antarctic science and studies of microbes during a structured informal education program in Maine for the benefit of high school students.   <br/><br/>By establishing the dynamics and interactions of (primarily) specific dsDNA virus groups in different habitats with different redox conditions throughout seasonal and inter annual cycles the project will learn about the biotic and abiotic factors that influence microbial community dynamics. This project does not require fieldwork in Antarctica. Instead, the investigators will leverage already collected and archived samples from three lakes that have concurrent measures of physicochemical information. Approximately 2 terabyte of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (including metagenomes, SSU rRNA amplicons and single virus genomes) will be generated from selected available samples through a Community Science Program (CSP) funded by the Joint Genome Institute. The investigators will employ bioinformatics to interrogate those sequence databases. In particular, they will focus on investigating the presence, phylogeny and co-occurrence of polintons, polinton-like viruses, virophages and large dsDNA phytoplankton viruses as well as of their putative eukaryotic microbial hosts. Bioinformatic analyses will be complemented with quantitative digital PCR and microbial association network analysis to detect specific virus?virus?host interactions from co-occurrence spatial and temporal patterns. Multivariate analysis and network analyses will also be performed to investigate which abiotic factors most closely correlate with phytoplankton and virus abundances, temporal dynamics, and observed virus-phytoplankton associations within the three lakes. The results of this project will improve understanding of phytoplankton and their viruses as vital components of the carbon cycle in Antarctic, marine-derived aquatic environments, and likely in any other aquatic environment.

They will participate in the Bureau of Land Management?s Campbell Creek Science Center Fireside Chat series to promote outreach to the more urban community in and around Anchorage, AK.  They will enhance the existing Interactive Model of Leaf Decomposition (IMOLD), a series of animated lessons and activities about decomposition and nutrient cycling developed under a previous award, to include examples and teaching activities derived from this work at the Arctic treeline.<br/><br/>It has long been thought that temperature exerts a direct control on growth of treeline trees and the position of the treeline.  However, the PIs? recent work in the Arctic with white spruce suggests that indirect effects of temperature on soil nutrient availability may be of equal or greater importance.  They hypothesize that cold soils at the treeline, particularly during winter, limit microbial activity and nutrient availability to the point where trees are barely able to survive and grow.  Measurements made during winter have revealed that Arctic forests maintain snowpacks that are much deeper than observed at treeline.  Trees are thought to trap snow and lead to a deeper snowpack, insulating the soil from cold air and allowing for greater overwinter microbial activity and greater nutrient mineralization.  Indeed, the PIs found a strong positive correlation between white spruce growth and winter snow depth.  They propose to isolate the mechanisms underlying this correlation by using snowfences to manipulate winter snow depth and fertilizer to increase soil nutrient availability at three treelines that differ in soil moisture.  To provide an experimental test of the importance of temperature as a direct control on treeline tree growth, they propose to incorporate experimental shoot warming into their snowfence experiment in a factorial design.  They predict that both experimental snow and nutrient additions will lead to large increases in microbial activity, photosynthesis, tree growth, seed quality, seed production, seedling establishment and recruitment of new trees.  They expect to observe the greatest positive responses where soils are wet and cold. Meanwhile, they predict that shoot warming will lead to negligible changes in growth."

These soils are protected from melting by a surface layer which thaws in summer and refreezes in winter, and a near-surface layer, termed the transition zone. This transition zone, which develops through complex interactions between the environment and permafrost, controls permafrost resilience to ground surface subsidence (thermokarst). Expectations are that as the climate warms, deeper seasonal melting will impact this transition zone, and ecosystems and infrastructure (i.e., roads, airfields, and buildings) stability. The goals of this project are to evaluate the properties of the transition zone from the High Arctic to the southern border of the permafrost region and to understand processes of formation, degradation, and recovery of the transition zone in various climatic regions. The knowledge gained from this work will inform Arctic science and engineering. The project will support student training. The investigators will collaborate with government agencies and engineering companies whose work is impacted by permafrost ground subsidence issues.<br/><br/>In previous research, the investigators identified a zone in the upper profile of permafrost soils that is critical to permafrost stability, soil development, and geomorphic processes. However, how the thickness and cryostructures of this transition zone (TZ) vary across climate and landscape gradients, the rates of its formation during ecological succession, and how it contributes to permafrost vulnerability and resilience, is not well understood. What knowledge we have is in low Arctic tundra and can be misleading if applied to other bioclimatic regions. To address this gap in knowledge, our collaborative research with the University of Montreal will focus on the TZ across climatic regions and landscapes distributed along a north-south transect from barren polar deserts with continuous permafrost in Canada, to boreal forests in southern Alaska with sporadic permafrost. Our group will also monitor and experiment with mass and heat transfer processes between the active layer (AL) and the TZ to identify mechanisms controlling segregated ice formation.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) could raise the global sea level by about 5 meters (16 feet) and the scientific community considers it the most significant risk for coastal environments and cities. The risk arises from the deep, marine setting of WAIS. Although scientists have been aware of the precarious setting of this ice sheet since the early 1970s, it is only now that the flow of ice in several large drainage basins is undergoing dynamic change consistent with a potentially irreversible disintegration. Understanding WAIS stability and enabling more accurate prediction of sea-level rise through computer simulation are two of the key objectives facing the polar science community today. This project will directly address both objectives by: (1) using state-of-the-art technologies to observe rapidly deforming parts of Thwaites Glacier that may have significant control over the future evolution of WAIS, and (2) using these new observations to improve ice-sheet models used to predict future sea-level rise. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of UK and US scientists. This international collaboration will result in new understanding of natural processes that may lead to the collapse of the WAIS and will boost infrastructure for research and education by creating a multidisciplinary network of scientists. This team will mentor three postdoctoral researchers, train four Ph.D. students and integrate undergraduate students in this research project.<br/><br/>The project will test the overarching hypothesis that shear-margin dynamics may exert powerful control on the future evolution of ice flow in Thwaites Drainage Basin. To test the hypothesis, the team will set up an ice observatory at two sites on the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier. The team argues that weak topographic control makes this shear margin susceptible to outward migration and, possibly, sudden jumps in response to the drawdown of inland ice when the grounding line of Thwaites retreats. The ice observatory is designed to produce new and comprehensive constraints on englacial properties, including ice deformation rates, ice crystal fabric, ice viscosity, ice temperature, ice water content and basal melt rates. The ice observatory will also establish basal conditions, including thickness and porosity of the till layer and the deeper marine sediments, if any. Furthermore, the team will develop new knowledge with an emphasis on physical processes, including direct assessment of the spatial and temporal scales on which these processes operate. Seismic surveys will be carried out in 2D and 3D using wireless geophones. A network of broadband seismometers will identify icequakes produced by crevassing and basal sliding. Autonomous radar systems with phased arrays will produce sequential images of rapidly deforming internal layers in 3D while potentially also revealing the geometry of a basal water system. Datasets will be incorporated into numerical models developed on different spatial scales. One will focus specifically on shear-margin dynamics, the other on how shear-margin dynamics can influence ice flow in the whole drainage basin. Upon completion, the project aims to have confirmed whether the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier can migrate rapidly, as hypothesized, and if so what the impacts will be in terms of sea-level rise in this century and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, a longer season of reduced ice cover suggests the possibility of more marine plant growth. Yet, the rate at which plants grow may be limited by the exhaustion of available nutrients during the longer growing season. Understanding is limited by an incomplete knowledge of how physical processes help replenish nutrients in the euphotic zone late in the season. Important processes span a range of scales, from small scale turbulent mixing to regional scale wind-driven upwelling. This project will pair novel physical and biological measurements to understand the biological response to changes in the physics. The work takes advantage of a scheduled cruise to reduce costs. The project will contribute to STEM workforce enhancement by supporting the development of an early career scientist. Public outreach will be accomplished through a science communication fellowship at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry. <br/><br/>During a cruise to the Chukchi Sea in late summer, instruments to measure fine-scale shear, velocity, and turbulence will be integrated onto a towed vehicle capable of high-resolution sampling over broad areas.

Research based out of Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Deadhorse, and Kaktovik will address how changes in shoreline erosion and freshwater inflows to the coastal ocean over seasonal, annual, and longer timeframes influence near-shore food webs. Research will be conducted in collaboration with local stakeholder groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This research will advance our fundamental understanding of how input of materials from land and oceanographic conditions interact to influence coastal food webs. It will also allow us to track and understand: 1) how natural climate cycles influence coastal ecosystems in the Arctic, and 2) how climate change effects such as permafrost thaw, shifting precipitation regimes, and losses of sea ice alter coastal ecosystems.  Near-shore food webs along the Alaskan Arctic coastline support large populations of migratory fish and waterfowl that are essential to the culture of Iupiat communities of northern Alaska. The research at this LTER site will create a framework for anticipating the impacts of future changes on the coastal ecosystem that are of great concern to these communities. Results from this LTER program will also be of interest to a broader science community that is working to understand potential connections between Arctic change and global carbon cycling. Finally, this LTER project includes a strong commitment to education through graduate and undergraduate student involvement, post-doctoral mentoring, continuation of a very successful Summer Science K-12 Program in Kaktovik, and establishment of a parallel K-12 program in Utqiagvik. In addition, this project will employ native high school seniors or recently graduated students living in Utqiagvik and Kaktovik as field research assistants. <br/><br/>Recent studies suggest that the ecological framework for understanding what controls food web structure needs to be expanded to include temporal forcing. More specifically, there is mounting evidence that differential availability of seasonally-distinct resources is critical for defining trophic linkages and maintaining stability and resilience of food webs. This new LTER program will use lagoons along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast as experimental units to test this concept, and broaden it to include temporal variations over longer timeframes. The Beaufort lagoons are ideal for testing this concept because they experience extreme variability in seasonal cycles, which are now subject to rapid directional shifts driven by climate change. Our overarching question is: How do variations in terrestrial inputs, local production, and exchange between lagoon and ocean waters over seasonal, inter-annual, inter-decadal, and longer timeframes interact to control food web structure through effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling, microbial and metazoan community composition, and trophic linkages? Arctic lagoons provide a unique opportunity to study these interactions in the absence of fringing wetlands that often modulate land-ocean interactions in other lagoon systems. In addition, barrier island geomorphology, which exerts a strong control on water exchange between lagoons and the open ocean, is highly dynamic in the Arctic because sea-ice effects on coastal geomorphology are superimposed on the effects of currents, sea level, and waves. Thus, connections between inputs from land and lagoon ecosystems are more direct, and water exchanges between lagoons and the open ocean are more variable than is typical of lower latitude systems.  Specific study sites will be located in Elson Lagoon (western Beaufort), Simpson Lagoon and Stefansson Sound (central Beaufort), and Kaktovik and Jago lagoons (eastern Beaufort). The LTER will include seasonal field work during ice covered, ice break-up, and open water periods and also include sensor deployments for continuous measurements of key biogeochemical and hydrographic parameters."

In the late nineteenth century, Sir George Nares came across 15-18 m thick, immobile, ice extending 480 km off the northern Ellesmere coast. The characteristics of the ice were very different from the 2-3 m thick ice now circulating the Arctic Ocean. Similar accounts from other arctic explorers from this time provided insight into what must surely have been a far thicker and more persistent ice cover over the Arctic Ocean during full glacial conditions than we see today. Indeed, low biological productivity and extremely low, or absent, sediment deposition in the Arctic during glacial periods suggest that parts of the central and western Arctic Ocean were covered by very thick, perennial ice. This research will explore how such ice could have covered much of the Arctic Ocean during glacial periods, how thick it could have been, and whether its eventual mobilization and demise could have produced freshwater output to the North Atlantic large enough to weaken the deep water formation and trigger abrupt climate cooling. Using a suite of sophisticated, high-resolution, coupled numerical model experiments, this group will address these questions and highlight the connection between changes in the Arctic hydrological cycle and global climate.<br/><br/>Each investigator has a serious commitment to education and public outreach, and the project will support and train a graduate student who will work with the investigators in all aspects of the research. Each investigator has been involved with local primary and secondary schools, either by making presentations, hiring students for the summer, mentoring science fair projects, or contributing to curriculum development. They will contribute to the on-going middle and high school science teacher training activities by developing a web-based, interactive, sea ice-learning tool to teach school children about the mechanisms behind sea ice formation and how ice will change as the arctic climate warms. In addition, well-developed relationships with local community organizations will help promote public understanding of abrupt climate change. The idea of thick sea ice in the Arctic has a remarkable ability to capture the public imagination in much the same way as it did in the Victorian period when explorers returned from the Arctic with tales of thick impenetrable ice, conveying the concept of the important role that the Arctic plays in global climate.<br/><br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from its ability to establish a link between the physical arctic system (circulation, sea ice, icebergs) and global climate. Numerical models have recently shown that freshwater sourced from the Arctic is twice as effective at disrupting climate than freshwater released from more southerly sources, but to the present the subject of freshwater and abrupt climate change has been dominated by discussion of meltwater floods emanating from glacial lake outbursts. Determining whether the export of sea ice and associated superimposed ice from the Arctic to the North Atlantic could supply enough freshwater to the Nordic Seas to cause the Earth's climate to cool will provide new insight into the mechanisms that trigger abrupt climate change. By quantifying the sensitivity of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to arctic freshwater forcing the researchers will also be able to better examine whether changes in the arctic hydrological cycle in the near future (from sea ice melt and freshwater export from the Beaufort Gyre) pose a threat to the stability of modern-day climate and human society. In addition, the numerical model developed for this project will resolve ocean circulation, sea ice, and iceberg transport at a resolution approx. 0.17 degrees (ca. 19 km), 5-10 times higher than that of existing paleo-climate models, and have the capability of simulating narrow coastal boundary currents, shelf-breaks, and frontal zones important for freshwater transport along the continental margins, and other features not captured by the current generation of paleo-climate models."

Genes that code for proteins must first make an RNA copy, and the actual protein is made from this RNA copy intermediate. MiRNAs regulate the amount of protein that is made by binding to the RNA intermediate and interrupting its production of protein. Binding of miRNAs to RNA depends strongly on temperature. Regulation of genes by miRNAs has not been studied in Antarctic fish, which live in seas with temperatures below the freezing point of fresh water. This project will compare miRNA regulation 1) in Antarctic fish vs. warm-water fish to learn how miRNAs regulate gene expression in constant cold; and 2) in Antarctic icefish with no red blood cells, enlarged hearts, and reduced bone density vs. closely related Antarctic fish containing red blood cells, normal hearts, and dense bones. The project will have broad impacts to science and society nationally and globally. First, this will be the first study of important factors in gene regulation (miRNAs) in Antarctic fish, which are an essential component of the entire ecology of the Southern Ocean, and will shed light on how these fish might respond to the warming of Antarctic waters. Second, it will bring Antarctic science to under-represented high school students at a local alternative downtown high school by conducting video conferences during the Antarctic field seasons and hosting student investigations of Antarctic fish in the research laboratory.<br/> <br/>microRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression that modulate development and physiology in temperate animals. Although miRNAs act by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), a process that is strongly sensitive to temperature, miRNAs have yet not been studied in Antarctic animals, including Notothenioid fish, which dominate the Southern Ocean. This project will compare miRNA regulation in 1) Antarctic vs. temperate fish to learn the roles of miRNA regulation in adaptation to constant cold; and in 2) bottom-dwelling, dense-boned, red-blooded Nototheniods vs. high buoyancy, osteopenic, white-blooded icefish to understand miRNA regulation in specialized organs after the evolution of the loss of hemoglobin genes and red blood cells, the origin of enlarged heart and vasculature, and the evolution of increased buoyancy, which arose by decreased bone mineralization and increased lipid deposition. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that Antarctic fish evolved miRNA-related genome specializations in response to constant cold. The project will compare four Antarctic Notothenioid species to two temperate Notothenioids and two temperate laboratory species to test the hypotheses that (a) Antarctic fish evolved miRNA genome repertoires by loss of ancestral genes and/or gain of new genes, (b) express miRNAs that are involved in cold tolerance, and (c) respond to temperature change by changing miRNA gene expression. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that the evolution of icefish from red-blooded bottom-dwelling ancestors was accompanied by an altered miRNA genomic repertoire, sequence, and/or expression. The project will test the hypotheses that (a) miRNAs in icefish evolved in sequence and/or in expression in icefish specializations, including head kidney (origin of red blood cells); heart (changes in vascular system), cranium and pectoral girdle (reduced bone mineral density); and skeletal muscle (lipid deposition), and (b) miRNAs that evolved in icefish specializations had ancestral functions related to their derived roles in icefish, as determined by functional tests of zebrafish orthologs of icefish miRNAs in developing zebrafish. The program will isolate, sequence, and determine the expression of miRNAs and mRNAs using high-throughput transcriptomics and novel software. Results will show how the microRNA system evolves in vertebrate animals pushed to physiological extremes and provide insights into the prospects of key species in the most rapidly warming part of the globe."

The project will be co-led by female PIs at the University of Colorado (CU) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), and will support the training and mentoring of a new graduate student at CU, and a science communication postdoc.  Because public understanding of these issues can be very low, the project includes a substantial outreach and science communication component. An interactive museum display demonstrating the interpretation and implications of trends and variability in Antarctic sea ice will be developed, along with provision of training for K-12 educators nationwide that focuses on using the display, or a web variant.<br/><br/>Large uncertainties in projected anthropogenic climate change impacts are related to Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Projected changes in Antarctic surface mass balance, sea ice extent, and surface temperature differ widely amongst current-generation climate models. Such uncertainties likely have roots in the mean states (climatologies) of different models. Recent observational and modeling evidence has implicated ocean mean-state biases in particular for the general inability of climate models to simulate trends in annual Antarctic sea ice extent observed by remote sensing. Ocean biases may be driven in part by a long-standing bias in absorbed shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean. The primary project goal is to systematically assess the influence of long-standing atmospheric radiation and ocean structure biases on the modelled climate of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, using a state-of-the-art community climate model (CESM). It is anticipated that the mean state (climatology) bias reductions will alter the response of sea ice extent and volume, air temperature, precipitation, surface mass balance, and sea level rise to anthropogenic forcing. Proposed climate modeling experiments,  together with existing numerical simulation experiments, will enable a more thorough and systematic assessment of the impact of mean-state biases on the simulation of climate variability and change across Antarctica and the Southern Ocean than has been previously possible."

This places today's concentration of 400 parts per million in stark contrast.  Furthermore, these gas records show that natural sources of greenhouse gas such as oceans and ecosystems act as amplifiers of climate change by increasing emissions of gases during warmer periods.  Such amplification is expected to occur in the future, adding to the human-produced gas burden.  The South Pole ice core will build upon these prior findings by expanding the suite of gases to include, for the first time, those potent trace gases that both trapped heat and depleted ozone during the past 40,000 years.  The present project on inert gases and methane in the South Pole ice core will improve the dating of this crucial record, to unprecedented precision, so that the relative timing of events can be used to learn about the mechanism of trace gas production and destruction, and consequent climate change amplification.  Ultimately, this information will inform predictions of future atmospheric chemical cleansing mechanisms and climate in the context of our rapidly changing atmosphere.  This award also engages young people in the excitement of discovery and polar research, helping to entrain the next generations of scientists and educators.  Education of graduate students, a young researcher (Buizert), and training of technicians, will add to the nation?s human resource base.   <br/> <br/>This award funds the construction of the gas chronology for the South Pole 1500m ice core, using measured inert gases (d15N and d40Ar--Nitrogen and Argon isotope ratios, respectively) and methane in combination with a next-generation firn densification model that treats the stochastic nature of air trapping and the role of impurities on densification.  The project addresses fundamental gaps in scientific understanding that limit the accuracy of gas chronologies, specifically a poor knowledge of the controls on ice-core d15N and the possible role of layering and impurities in firn densification.  These gaps will be addressed by studying the gas enclosure process in modern firn at the deep core site.  The work will comprise the first-ever firn air pumping experiment that has tightly co-located measurements of firn structural properties on the core taken from the same borehole.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the lock-in horizon as defined by firn air d15N, CO2, and methane is structurally controlled by impermeable layers, which are in turn created by high-impurity content horizons in which densification is enhanced.  Thermal signals will be sought using the inert gas measurements, which improve the temperature record with benefits to the firn densification modeling.  Neon, argon, and oxygen will be measured in firn air and a limited number of deep core samples to test whether glacial period layering was enhanced, which could explain low observed d15N in the last glacial period.  Drawing on separate volcanic and methane synchronization to well-dated ice cores to create independent ice and gas tie points, independent empirical estimates of the gas age-ice age difference will be made to check the validity of the firn densification model-inert gas approach to calculating the gas age-ice age difference.  These points will also be used to test whether the anomalously low d15N seen during the last glacial period in east Antarctic ice cores is due to deep air convection in the firn, or a missing impurity dependence in the firn densification models.  <br/><br/>The increased physical understanding gained from these studies, combined with new high-precision measurements, will lead to improved accuracy of the gas chronology of the South Pole ice core, which will enhance the overall science return from this gas-oriented core.  This will lead to clarification of timing of atmospheric gas variations and temperature, and aid in efforts to understand the biogeochemical feedbacks among trace gases.  These feedbacks bear on the future response of the Earth System to anthropogenic forcing.  Ozone-depleting substances will be measured in the South Pole ice core record, and a precise gas chronology will add value.  Lastly, by seeking a better understanding of the physics of gas entrapment, the project aims to have an impact on ice-core science in general."

The Thwaites Glacier system dominates the contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica. Predicting how this system will evolve in coming decades, and thereby its likely contribution to sea level, requires detailed understanding of how it has responded to changes in climate and oceanographic conditions in the past. This project will provide a record of regional sea-level change by establishing chronologies for raised marine beaches as well as the timing and duration of periods of retreat of Thwaites Glacier during the past 10,000 years by sampling and dating bedrock presently covered by Thwaites Glacier via subglacial drilling. Together with climatic and oceanographic conditions from other records, these will provide boundary conditions for past-to-present model simulations as well as those used to predict future glacier changes under a range of climate scenarios. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis--implied by existing geological evidence from the region--that present rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier system is reversible. <br/><br/>The team aims to utilize two approaches: 1. To reconstruct relative sea level during the Holocene, it will map and date raised marine and shoreline deposits throughout Pine Island Bay. Chronological constraints on sea-level change will be provided by radiocarbon dating of organic material in landforms and sediments that are genetically related to past sea level, such as shell fragments, bones of marine fauna, and penguin guano. 2. To obtain geological evidence for past episodes of grounding-line retreat, the team will apply cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-dating of subglacial bedrock. Using drill systems recently developed for subglacial bedrock recovery, the team will obtain subglacial bedrock from sites where ice thickness is dynamically linked to grounding-line position in the Thwaites system (specifically in the Hudson Mountains, and near Mount Murphy). Observation of significant cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations--the team will primarily measure Beryllium-10 and in situ Carbon-14--in these samples would provide direct, unambiguous evidence for past episodes of thinning linked to grounding-line retreat as well as constraints on their timing and duration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These traditional models changed as new methods allowed recognition of the importance of bacteria and other non-photosynthetic ?protozoa? in more complex food webs. More recently, the wide-spread existence of mixotrophs (organisms that can both photosynthesize and ingest food particles) and their importance as microbial predators has been recognized in many oceanographic areas. In the Southern Ocean, the only two surveys of mixotrophs have suggested that there may be seasonal differences in their importance as predators. During the long polar night (winter), the ability of mixotrophs to ingest particulate food may aid in their survival thus ensuring a sufficient population in spring to support a phytoplankton bloom once photosynthesis rates can increase. Thus mixotrophs may provide a critical early food source upon which zooplankton and larger animals depend on for growth and reproduction. This project will advance understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact within the Southern Ocean microbial food web. Specifically, efforts will be focused on mixotrophy in the western Antarctica peninsula region during the austral spring and autumn when there are likely to be changes in the relative importance of photosynthesis and ingestion to mixotrophs. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. There will be real-time outreach from the Southern Ocean to the public via blogs and interviews, and to high school art students through an established program that blends science and art education. <br/><br/>Despite traditional views of protists as either ""phototrophic"" or ""heterotrophic,"" there are many photosynthetic protists that consume prey (mixotrophy). Mixotrophy is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic systems and phytoplankton groups with known mixotrophic species, notably chrysophytes, cryptophytes, prymnesiophytes, prasinophytes and dinoflagellates, are present and often abundant in Antarctic waters. However, in the Southern Ocean, the presence of mixotrophic phytoflagellates has been surveyed only twice: in the Ross Sea during Austral spring 2008 and summer 2011. The primary goals of the project are to gain better understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact with respect to the Southern Ocean microbial food web. The contribution of mixotrophs to primary production and bacterial consumption is likely linked to the taxonomic composition of the community and the abundance of particular species. Abundances of novel mixotrophic species will be evaluated via qPCR, which will be coupled with assessments of rates of feeding and photosynthesis with the goal of describing how active mixotrophs direct the movement of carbon through food webs. These experiments will help the determination of how viable and widespread mixotrophy is as a nutritional strategy in polar waters and give direct information on the currently unknown diversity of mixotrophic taxa under different environmental conditions occurring in austral spring and autumn. Furthermore, the methods will simultaneously yield information on the whole communities of protists - mixotrophic, phototrophic and heterotrophic. In addition, a method to examine aspects of the taxonomic and functional diversities of the bacterivorous/mixotrophic community will be employed. A thymidine analog (BrdU) will be used to label DNA of eukaryotes feeding on bacteria. The BrdU-labeled eukaryotic DNA will be isolated using immunoprecipitation. High-throughput sequencing of the labeled DNA (bacterivores) versus unlabeled community DNA will determine the diversity of bacterivorous mixotrophs relative to other microeukaryotes.

However, there is increasing recognition that mixotrophs, which combine phototrophy and heterotrophy in a single organism, are important components of planktonic food webs.  Based on prior work, the investigators have confirmed the ubiquitous nature of mixotrophs in Arctic and Antarctic waters and hypothesize that a possible consequence to the warming of Arctic surface waters is that pico- and nano-mixotrophs will become more abundant in the region.  Using water samples from across the Arctic, the investigators will conduct laboratory experiments to better understand the environmental conditions that trigger mixotrophic activity.  Such experiments will also provide information on how the microbial food web will function in a warming climate and how such changes will potentially affect higher trophic levels, such as fish. This work will provide a possibly transformative re-orienting of our current view of surface water food webs structure and dynamics and nutrient flows in a changing Arctic.

In addition, the project includes outreach to local schools in urban Philadelphia, and collaboration with a Falmouth, MA. high school art teacher as part of novel art-science projects (STEAM).<br/><br/>As Arctic water temperatures warm, the investigators predict a two-fold effect on the marine food web.  First, they predict an increased contribution to primary production from pico- and nano-phytoplankton.  Second, they predict an impact on bacterial consumption owing to the fact that many of the pico- and nano-phytoplankton species exhibit mixotrophic behavior.  The investigators propose a number of laboratory experiments on strains of algal groups that have been identified as mixotrophic species and are found in Arctic waters.  Arctic marine isolates will be acquired from the Roscoff Culture Collection and the National Center of Marine Algae.  Species specific mixotrophic activity and grazing rates will be determined across a range of environmental conditions that trigger and/or stimulate mixotrophy, such as high/low light and high/low nutrients.   From these species specific measurements, along with qPCR analysis to determine species abundances in water samples from across the Arctic marine environment, the potential impact of mixotrophic activity can be assessed on an Arctic-wide basis.  Finally, to determine and compare the levels of mixotrophic activity in environmental samples without relying on ingestion experiments the investigators will develop a gene-based method of activity based upon RNA sequencing and the results of the environmental response experiments discussed above.  This will be important for prediction in a warmer world."

It is often assumed that chlorine enters non-contaminated ecosystems mostly in the form of chloride (the same negative ion in table salt), and that chloride does not interact with plants or soil microorganisms. However, there is growing evidence that chloride is taken up and transformed by plants and soil microorganisms into complex chlorine-containing organic compounds. In environments where oxygen is scarce, some bacteria can use these chlorinated organic compounds instead of oxygen in a form of anaerobic respiration called organohalide respiration (OHR). In this way, these bacteria can quickly use up energy sources that would otherwise be used to produce methane. This means that an active biological chlorine cycle could reduce the amount of methane that is released into the atmosphere. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, trapping about 30 times as much heat per molecule as carbon dioxide. The Arctic region has been warming faster than the rest of the planet, and large amounts of organic carbon are stored in Arctic soils. It is thus important to understand how much soil carbon will be lost to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or methane, since these two gases have different effects on the climate the climate system. This project measures rates of biological chlorine cycling in locations across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, and tests whether organohalide respiration does in fact significantly reduces methane production in these areas. This project could inform models of greenhouse gas emissions, improve understanding of the fate of chlorinated contaminants in Arctic soils, and further the basic science of biological chlorine cycling. The project will involve students at a minority-serving institution (San Diego State University) and a high school teacher, who will lead broader outreach and education efforts.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses the following two questions: (1) Does OHR inhibit methanogenesis via competition for H2? (2) How does the relative magnitude of Cl cycling and its relationship to CH4 flux change along a coastal-inland gradient in the Arctic Coastal Plain? The experimental approach consists of a field survey that compares CH4 fluxes and indicators of Cl cycling along a gradient of coastal influence from Barrow to the foothills of the Brooks Range, and a laboratory incubation experiment to study the relationships among OHR, methanogenesis, other terminal electron acceptor processes, and H2 availability. Indicators of Cl cycling include sizes and transformation rates of soil Cl pools, metagenomes describing the relative abundance of genes and microbial taxa associated with Cl cycling and other anaerobic processes, and 37Cl and 36Cl isotopic analysis to infer the dominant Cl cycling processes and to constrain long-term cycling rates. The laboratory incubation will follow anaerobic processes (OHR, iron reduction, methanogenesis, acetogenesis, and sulfate reduction) in microcosms varying in Clorg and H2 concentration to establish the thermodynamic hierarchy among these processes and whether competition is alleviated by increased H2."

There is a lot of it in frozen ground, called permafrost, in the Arctic that can be released as the permafrost thaws, so warming in the Arctic can lead to more warming, a so-called positive feedback. Understanding such feedbacks is an important part of understanding how the arctic system works. Much of this process occurs at the bottoms of lakes, where some of the methane is frozen in lake sediments beneath the lake, but some also comes from under the permafrost deep under the lake. Methane release from the sub-permafrost environment under lakes would be a new and poorly understood feedback to the climate system.<br/><br/>This project is a first step in exploring these processes within the hydrology-permafrost-methane lake-to-watershed system to inform future biogeochemical models for methane release. Since lakes in areas of discontinuous permafrost are common, the proposed study domain will offer process-oriented insights that are applicable across the Arctic.<br/><br/>The project will also train postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students and support an early-career scientist. In addition there will be outreach to science teachers and their students in fieldwork and classroom activities on lakes and integration of results into K-G12 curriculum through the National Geographic Society's Learning program, and to millions of National Geographic magazine readers, television viewers and K- G12 students. Further, the efforts will contribute to the Alaska Geological and Hydrological Survey program to develop a detailed understanding of Alaska's groundwater systems via the central involvement of the Alaska Geological and Geophysical Survey.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>Uncertainties in the budget of atmospheric methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas released by thermokarst lakes, limit the accuracy of climate change projections. The objective of this grant is to refine climate feedback representations by integrating permafrost-hydrology-methane processes across scales (thermokarst-lake to watershed). Methane release from thermokarst lakes is typically considered to be solely derived from the lake and its talik (thaw bulb beneath the lake), while not accounting for the production, storage, and potential escape of CH4 beneath the permafrost. A rugged permafrost bottom is proposed to favor gas storage in hollow ""pockets"", which can rapidly release large sub(below)- permafrost CH4 stores when an open-talik forms that connects the sub-permafrost to the supra(above)- permafrost environment. Groundwater flow could accelerate thaw and therefore enhance CH4 formation and release. Model experiments informed by field measurements and laboratory analyses at Goldstream Valley, Interior Alaska, will test the hypothesis that the coupled hydrology-permafrost-methane system releases more CH4 than a scenario with static hydrology and only supra-permafrost CH4 sources. The resulting radiative forcing will be quantified via conceptual modeling, also informed by field measurements and laboratory analyses, to include talik and sub-permafrost CH4 and CO2 emissions, anaerobic oxidation of sub-permafrost CH4, and CO2 uptake and sequestration as lake sediments form peat. In addition to a watershed-scale quantification, a first order estimation of the sub-permafrost derived radiative forcing will be provided for the pan-arctic discontinuous permafrost domain of yedoma (organic-rich, Pleistocene-aged, loess-dominated permafrost)."

As first inhabitants, stewards, and traditional users intimately tied to the Arctic environment, the discrete status, rights, and interests of Inuit as Indigenous Peoples are affirmed in a number of legally binding treaties, as well as other international human rights instruments and domestic laws. Inuit authorities, organizations, and communities are central to the establishment and maintenance of effective mechanisms for safeguarding this ecologically and culturally unique region.<br/><br/>The Food Sovereignty and Self-Governance Project aims to advance understanding of Inuit self-governance of marine resources deemed crucial for Inuit food security. This includes exploring how Inuit co-management systems support food sovereignty objectives - outcomes that are essential for supporting human rights of Inuit communities. This project will examine the role Inuit communities in Alaska and Canada play in managing these resources as co-equal partners with their counterparts in federal, state, and local government agencies. The results derived from the research will prove valuable to other Arctic federal governments collaborating with Indigenous communities to achieve objectives related to the environmental, social, and ecological well-being of the Arctic. <br/><br/><br/>The project's overarching goals are to:<br/><br/>1) Synthesize the existing legal frameworks providing for Inuit self-governance by evaluating applicable legal authorities in the United States (U.S.) and Canada;<br/>2) Determine how existing Inuit self-governance approaches operate in practice by examining four co-management case studies as examples of approaches to food sovereignty. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the social, political, and institutional parameters affecting implementation of key legal frameworks;<br/>3) Understand whether and how Inuit self-governance systems support food sovereignty by comparing food sovereignty objectives against both these legal frameworks and observation of the implementation of those systems in practice; and<br/>4) Disseminate Project findings to Inuit, state/territorial, national, and international leaders with the goal of supporting and driving improvements to systems providing for collaborative management of Arctic marine resources in the face of rapid ecological change.<br/><br/>The Project Team will take a two-tiered analytical approach to address these goals: (1) doctrinal legal research that evaluates legal and institutional frameworks; and <br/>(2) socio-legal analysis through case-studies.   The legal research will examine relevant laws, regulations, and policies at all levels of government, building a framework essential to understanding how Arctic collaborative governance functions in theory.  The case studies will take the next step - moving from how these governance systems should work to how they operate in practice - and, ultimately, how they could be improved in a manner which optimizes outcomes for food sovereignty, human rights, and resource sustainability. Case studies conducted in partnership with those participating in co-management regimes, will focus on Walrus and Salmon in Alaska and Char and Beluga in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of Canada. Current partners of this project include:<br/><br/>(1) The Eskimo Walrus Commission<br/>(2) The Fisheries Joint Management Committee<br/>(3) The Inuvialuit Game Council<br/><br/>Organizations advising this project include both the Association of Village Council Presidents and the Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada.<br/><br/>Project researchers conducting the case study analysis will follow a ""co-production of knowledge"" approach, in which no one person's information and knowledge is assigned greater inherent value than another's. Researchers with utilize Indigenous Knowledge and social science methodologies. The project will intimately engage with Inuit who play a role in natural resources management in the U.S. and Canadian Arctic under each case study, through focus groups, semi-directive interviews and discussions'all guided by input provided by an expert Advisory Committee. <br/><br/>The Project will advance the state of knowledge on how Inuit self-governance approaches support Inuit food sovereignty objectives and resource sustainability. With a combined focus on the United States and Canada, the Project will enable comparative analysis of legal and institutional structures, practices, and perceptions to facilitate critical evaluation of Inuit self-governance over marine resources as embodied in co-management regimes. This research will also be useful for other Arctic nations that are working with Indigenous peoples to achieve the environmental, social, and ecological well-being of the Arctic."

Since it does not drift with the winds and currents, shorefast ice forms an important habitat for wildlife and a platform for human subsistence food production and transport in the Arctic. As the climate warms, residents local to the Arctic report that it is breaking up earlier in the year and is thinner than it was a few decades ago. These environmental changes threaten the sustainability of wildlife and traditional human activities that depend on shorefast ice. Despite its significance, a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment of shorefast ice has yet to be made in Greenland. This project therefore seeks to understand how shorefast ice has responded to atmospheric and oceanic warming, and how these changes have affected livelihoods in communities local to the Uummannaq region of West Greenland. The results will improve institutional knowledge of environmental change in the Arctic and prediction of its associated impacts, as well as strengthen US relations in an area of, potentially global, strategic and economic importance.<br/><br/>The project will co-produce shorefast ice knowledge by leveraging large satellite remote sensing datasets, community-based monitoring and local and Indigenous knowledge. First, observations from high-resolution optical satellite sensors will be supplemented with knowledge gathered from local residents. A community-based monitoring program will then be initiated using small multi-rotor UAVs to document key shorefast ice processes (e.g. formation and break-up) as they happen. The quantitative and qualitative shorefast ice knowledge generated by these two activities will be used to understand not only how the shorefast ice has changed but how these changes matter to individuals and communities in the Uummannaq region. The involvement of residents and institutions in Uummannaq at all stages of the project, in combination with ongoing observations, will lay the foundations for ongoing community support and enable new insights into the complex social, cultural and economic changes caused by rapid environmental change. The findings will also enhance the ability of local residents and institutions to make informed and embedded choices concerning natural resource governance and management, as well as choices about individual and collective trajectories towards a desirable and sustainable future.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Office of International Science & Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, while ongoing climate warming and permafrost thaw are expected to increase plant productivity (CO2 uptake), continued warming is also expected to weaken prior constraints on decomposition (CO2 emissions). The net effect of these changes on the Arctic?s carbon budget and the global climate system are poorly understood, as most observations have been made during the short growing season, when root and rhizosphere respiration dominate CO2 emissions.  This project will focus on the development of a new technology for the continuous collection of CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils. This passive diffusive sieve (zeolite) trap for measuring soil respired CO2 will be rugged, small, lightweight, low-cost, and require little in the way of power (batteries) low power.  It has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling in the Arctic, as it allows for the year-round CO2 collection, including during the winter and shoulder seasons when sites are often inaccessible, and over multiple weeks (3 weeks/sample), thus integrating both diffusive and episodic emissions.  Outreach activities will strengthen the existing NSF-supported K-12 training programs at UC Irvine that are aimed to increase the participation of underprivileged populations in the STEM fields. THE Investigators will engage middle school students with lab tours and activities during a ?Day at College?-experience and class room visits. The project will also train a graduate student, and contribute to educating researchers (via an international summer course) in the use of 14C analysis in Ecology and Earth System Science.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  However, typical canister-based systems for measuring soil respired CO2, can be relatively large, expensive to ship, and require line power.  This project will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from Arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  This continuous collection system has the potential to transform carbon cycle research.  Such devices would obviate the need for shipping large canisters to the Arctic as well and the need for line power.  Moreover, such devices are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, and therefore, permit for high spatial resolution monitoring.  These new traps, however, have never been tested in the Arctic, where the environmental conditions can be harsh, especially in winter.  Thus the focus of this work is to develop, harden, and test such devices through a number of winter seasons at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Station, on the north slope of Alaska.  If successful, this device will provide the first year-round, quasi-continuous dataset on soil-respired 14CO2 in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is the dominant tundra type of arctic Alaska and globally accounts for over 20% of the tundra land surface.  Moreover, this research will point the way for other experimental groups working in similar harsh environments throughout the Arctic."

The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. <br/><br/>The fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest."

The study is motivated by recognition that the Arctic Ocean is becoming more accessible for resource exploration, marine shipping, tourism and other activities, increasing the need for reliable seasonal predictions of ice conditions. The project will focus on regional scales addressing stakeholder needs. All Arctic coastal&#8232;seas and the channels of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be examined, but emphasis will be placed on the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. This recognizes these regions as foci for resource exploration, where ships entering or exiting the Arctic Ocean via Bering Strait must pass, and as part of the seasonal bowhead whale migration route supporting subsistence hunting. <br/><br/>The core of the proposed approach is that the date of the spring/summer sea ice retreat to a given location (e.g., the continental shelf break) can be used to predict the date of the autumn advance back to that location (i.e. freeze-up), and hence the open water period. This reflects albedo feedback and ocean heat uptake processes that have always been part of the sea ice system. Briefly, earlier seasonal sea ice melt and retreat leads to earlier exposure of dark open water areas that readily absorb solar radiation, meaning more heat in the ocean mixed layer at summer's end, delaying autumn ice growth. This is manifested in observations that the upward trend in the open water period in the Chukchi Sea is driven more by later autumn return of ice than an earlier spring/summer retreat, and that there is a strong relationship between ice retreat and return in de-trended time series of the two variables. <br/><br/>Factors such as atmospheric variability and ocean heat transport are viewed as modulating expressions of albedo feedback and ocean heat uptake; such variables, along with seasonal climate forecasts, will be examined as additional predictors. It will be determined in which&#8232;sectors predictions are most and least skillful, the reasons for these differences, and whether&#8232;the changing sea ice regime (e.g., changing ice thickness) is changing predictability. In&#8232;addition, multiple processes, including winter atmospheric conditions, ocean heat transport, ice thickness and surface melt onset, will be examined as sources of predictability on the&#8232;date of retreat. The study will utilize satellite observations of sea ice extent and concentration, surface melt onset, ice motion, thickness and age, ocean heat flux measurements, and output&#8232;from the NCEP coupled Climate Forecast System, Version 2, along with fields of sea level pressure, temperature and other variables from two modern atmospheric reanalyses. <br/><br/>The Arctic Ocean, particularly the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, is of growing strategic importance&#8232;to our nation. The proposed&#8232;effort to provide skillful seasonal predictions of sea ice conditions at the regional scale&#8232;serves the goal of improving methods of connecting science with decision making through addressing diverse stakeholder needs, including marine&#8232;shipping agencies, extraction industries and subsistence hunting. Support is included for a graduate student and undergraduate students to help educate the next generation of scientists, and study results will be assimilated&#8232;into an Arctic climate course at the University of Colorado."

In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES Program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions. Some trace elements are essential to life, others are known biological toxins, and still others are important because they can be used as tracers of a variety of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the sea. Within this broader framework, the goal of this project is to measure the naturally occurring radionuclides radium-226 (half-life 1600 years), lead-210 (half-life 22.1 y) and polonium-210 (half-life 138 days) to determine removal rates of particle reactive TEIs from the water column and to study the processes responsible for their scavenging, lateral and vertical transport and accumulation in bottom sediments. A wide range of processes will be encountered along the proposed ARCTIC GEOTRACES section and the proposed study will play a key role in the interpretation of observed TEI distributions and address the following questions: (1) What is the variability in scavenging intensity of polonium and lead between the Pacific waters and that of particle dominated areas of the shelf? (2) How does the scavenging intensity of polonium and lead change across areas of varying nutrient concentrations in the Chukchi Sea? (3) How does the scavenging intensity vary between Canadian Basin and the Makarov Basin? (4) Which are the areas of enhanced sediment focusing in this region and how important is the role of boundary scavenging and lateral transport of particles with respect to lead-210 distribution in water column and sediments? (5) What are the seasonal scale vertical fluxes of particulate organic matter in this region and the relative importance of lateral versus vertical transport of organic matter and other TEIs? (6) How do particle mixing rates vary across the basin and impact reduction rates? (7) Are the bottom waters in the shelf region enriched in polonium-210 due to sediment remobilization? The ability to address these questions will allow better understanding of processes controlling the distribution in this region of other TEIs that will be measured by other investigators. The broader impacts of the research include the involvement of 1 Ph.D. student and at least 2 undergraduate students. The lead investigator is an early-career scientist  and this project will help him in extending his expertise in the Arctic region and further development of his career. The investigator is involved in numerous local outreach activities that will provide opportunities for education of the general public and high school students about marine ecosystems and how it affects their environmental well-being.

Layers of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in glacial ice can be used to establish an accurate ice core chronology. In order to use a visible or ultrafine volcanic ash layer as a time-stratigraphic marker, a unique geochemical fingerprint must be established, and this forms the basis of our research. This award will investigate the volcanic record in the 1751 m ice core that was completed at the South Pole during the 2015/16 field season. The core is in an ideal location to link the existing, established, volcanic records in East and West Antarctica, and therefore to connect and integrate those records, allowing the climate records of ice cores to be directly compared, as well as to focus research on the most widespread and significant volcanic eruptions from West Antarctica.  Tephra derived from well-dated, large, tropical volcanic eruptions that may have had an impact on climate will also be studied.   Recent success in identifying and analyzing very fine ash particles from these types of eruptions makes it likely that we will be able to pinpoint some of these eruptions, which will allow the sulfate peaks associated with these layers to be positively identified and dated. Volcanic forcing time series developed from earlier South Pole ice cores based on preserved sulfate were crucial for testing climate models, but without tephra analysis, the origin of these layers remains uncertain. <br/><br/>Work on the tephra layers in the South Pole ice core has a number of significant specific objectives, some with practical applications to the basic science goals of Antarctic ice coring, and others that represent independent scientific contributions in their own right. These include: (1) providing independently dated time-intervals in the core, particularly for the deepest ice, (2) quantitatively linking tephra records across Antarctica with the goal of allowing direct and robust climate comparisons between these different parts of the continent, (3) providing information for large local eruptions, that will lead to direct estimates of eruption magnitude and dispersal patterns of Antarctic volcanoes, several of which will likely erupt again. The initial stages of the work will be carried out by identifying silicate-bearing horizons in the ice core, using several methods.  Once found, silicate particles will be imaged so that morphological characteristics of the particles can be used to identify volcanic origin.  Particles identified as tephra will then be chemically analyzed using electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS.  Samples that yield a robust chemical fingerprint will be statistically correlated to known eruptions, and this will be used to address the goals described above.  Broader impacts of this project fall into the areas of education of future generation of researchers, outreach and international cooperation. These activities will continue to promote forward progress in integrating the Antarctic tephra record and more broadly tying it to the global volcanic record."

This study will examine how warming is leading to a new hydrological regime in regions adjacent to the areas where major sea-ice losses have occurred. The new hydrological regime is result of an increase in annual precipitation, a higher proportion of which is in the form of rain rather than snow, especially in the transition seasons of fall and spring. Under this collaborative project, the team will study annually laminated sediments in lakes of western Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) to identify the sedimentary signal of recent changes in hydrology and use this to reconstruct the long-term history of rainfall-related sedimentary events to determine when similar conditions may have prevailed in the past. This project will involve a postdoctoral scientist, a graduate student, and undergraduate students at University of Massachusetts and Bates College, as well as teacher in the research.

The investigators will study annually laminated sediments in lakes of western Svalbard to identify the sedimentary signal of recent changes in hydrology and reconstruct the long-term history of rainfall-related sedimentary events to determine when similar conditions may have prevailed in the past. The type and amount of sediment transported to lakes carries with it information about meteorological and hydrological conditions in the lake watershed. The investigators will recover sediment cores to study the structure and grain size profiles of recent years of sediment accumulation, to compare with meteorological measurements, sediment recovered in traps, and measurements of processes responsible for sediment transport and deposition. They will employ microanalytcal techniques for high-resolution grain size analysis, varve detection and measurement. Using scanning electron microscope image analysis methods, they will reconstruct rainfall-driven sedimentary events. Sediments acquired from sediment traps will be analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer to obtain sub-annual scale grain size profiles to compare with observed hydroclimatic events and the varved records. This will provide a unique perspective on the nature of recent sedimentary changes and provide insight into the effects of contemporary changes in climate on the hydrological regime of this region. The results will have implications for other parts of the Arctic where sea-ice is rapidly receding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, many organisms may spread into Arctic waters, and some present significant threats to human and ecosystem health, such as harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (commonly called red tides). The investigators present evidence that HABs occur in the Chukchi Sea and we know that the potent neurotoxins they produce can affect marine mammals, seabirds, and other resources critical to subsistence harvesters. At the same time, little is known about the present and future risk from toxic algae to humans in the Pacific Arctic region. This study will be the first to document the current distribution of highly toxic HAB species at high resolution over large spatial scales within the Alaskan Arctic and along its transport pathways and will provide estimates of areas at high risk of toxicity now and in a warming future. The investigators will disseminate results via brochures, public lectures, and radio interviews in native communities, as well as through discussions with local scientists and managers. The project will contribute to K-12 education through the Woods Hole Science  and Technology Educational Partnership and will provide training for postdoctoral investigators and graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The hypothesis underlying this project is that harmful algal bloom species (HABs) in Alaskan Arctic waters are not only advected from the south through Bering Strait but are now originating locally on the Chukchi shelf due to warming temperatures, circulation dynamics, and water mass structure that influence bloom magnitude, duration, toxicity, and recurrence. This will be addressed through a joint physical-biological field and laboratory program to study the relationship between HAB species distribution/dynamics and the physical environment of the Chukchi Sea region. The distribution of HAB species on the Chukchi shelf will be mapped in relation to hydrography and circulation, including a comprehensive survey of the Alaskan Coastal Current which transports the warmest water in the Chukchi Sea. A range of molecular and physiological tools will be used to investigate the origin, connectivity, and fate of HAB populations in the region in the context of large-scale wind forcing and partitioning of water masses flowing through Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea. Cyst and isotope profiling will establish a historical record of blooms along the major transport pathways to the western Arctic. Finally, conceptual models of the origin, transport, and fate of HABs in the Chukchi Sea region will elucidate linkages to the flow pathways, dynamics, and characteristics of the different water masses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These measurements of neutral-ion coupling and Joule heating, in the critical region above 100 km, are an objective of highest priority for the upper atmosphere science community. Development of the neutral atmosphere temperature climatology is crucial for calibrating satellite observations of the polar mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) region and validating global climate models; in decades from now this climatology records will serve as the baseline against which long-term temperature trends in the changing Antarctic climate are assessed. The studies of extreme summertime Fe events and solar effects on Fe-layer's bottom side are improving the understanding of iron chemistry at polar latitudes. The vertical heat and constituent flux observations with the lidars are enhancing the knowledge of wave-induced transport in the polar mesopause region and remove the greatest source of uncertainty in current chemical-dynamical models of the mesospheric metal layers. This also led to improvements in quantitative estimates of the cosmic dust input that has implications for a variety of geophysical processes throughout the Antarctic atmosphere and Southern Ocean. The characterization and analysis of the gravity wave field in the neutral atmosphere above McMurdo are advancing the understanding of wave coupling in the MLT region and provide better constraints on wave parameterization schemes in climate models. Thus, the McMurdo lidar campaigns provide a new look into the composition, chemistry, temperature, and dynamics of the polar upper atmosphere in a critical latitudinal gap region mid-way between the South Pole and Antarctic Circle. The Fe-Boltzmann lidar has already produced a rich dataset stored in the CEDAR/Madrigal database, which is readily available to other scientists to help supporting their own research on polar aeronomy and climate. This project provides exceptional opportunities to train students and young researchers by giving them fieldwork experience in Antarctica. The project also enhances classroom teaching and graduate programs at several prominent universities around the world."

Agricultural history in Greenland goes back over 1000 years and understanding contemporary agricultural changes must be contextualized by a deeper ethnographic inquiry.

This volcano is an end-member type known as phonolitic, which refers to the lava composition, and is almost purely carbon-dioxide-bearing and occurs in continental rift settings. It is in contrast to the better known water-bearing volcanoes which occur at plate boundary settings (such as Mount St Helens or Mount Fuji).  Phonolitic volcanic eruptions elsewhere such as Tamboro or Vesuvius have caused more than 50,000 eruption related fatalities. Phonolites are also associated with rare earth element deposits, giving them economic interest. To illuminate the inner workings of Mount Erebus, we will cover the volcano with a dense network of geophysical probes based on magnetotelluric (MT) measurements. MT makes use of naturally occurring electromagnetic (EM) waves generated mainly by the sun as sources to provide images of the electrical conductivity structure of the Earth's interior. Conductivity is sensitive to the presence of fluids and melts in the Earth and so is well suited to understanding volcanic processes. The project is a cooperative effort between scientists from the United States, New Zealand, Japan and Canada. It implements new technology developed by the lead investigator and associates that allows such measurements to be taken on snow-covered terrains. This has applicability for frozen environments generally, such as resource exploration in the Arctic. The project supports a new post-doctoral researcher, and leverages imaging and measurement methods developed through support by other agencies and interfaced with commercial platforms.<br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The investigators propose to test magmatic evolution models for Mount Erebus volcano, Antarctica, using the magnetotelluric (MT) method. The phonolite lava flow compositions on Mount Erebus are uncommon, but provide a window into the range of upper mantle source compositions and melt differentiation paths. Explosive phonolite eruptions have been known worldwide for devastating eruptions such as Tambora and Vesuvius, and commonly host rare earth element deposits. In the MT method, temporal variations in the Earth's natural electromagnetic (EM) field are used as source fields to probe the electrical resistivity structure in the depth range of 1 to 100 kilometers.  This   effort will consist of approximately 100 MT sites, with some concentration in the summit area. Field acquisition will take place over two field seasons. The main goals are to 1) confirm the existence and the geometry of the uppermost magma chamber thought to reside at 5-10 kilometer depths; 2) attempt to identify, in the deeper resistivity structure, the magma staging area near the crust-mantle boundary; 3) image the steep, crustal-scale, near-vertical conduit carrying magma from the mantle; 4) infer the physical and chemical state from geophysical properties of a CO2-dominated mafic shield volcano; and 5) constrain the relationships between structural and magmatic/ hydrothermal activity related to the Terror Rift. Tomographic imaging of the interior resistivity will be performed using a new inversion platform developed at Utah, based on the deformable edge finite element method, that is the best available for accommodating the steep topography of the study area. The project is an international cooperation between University of Utah, GNS Science Wellington New Zealand (G. Hill, Co-I), and Tokyo Institute of Technology Japan (Y. Ogawa, Co-I), plus participation by University of Alberta (M. Unsworth) and Missouri State University (K. Mickus). Instrument deployments will be made exclusively by helicopter. The project implements new technology that allows MT measurements to be taken on snow-covered terrains.

However, while ongoing climate warming and permafrost thaw are expected to increase plant productivity (CO2 uptake), continued warming is also expected to weaken prior constraints on decomposition (CO2 emissions). The net effect of these changes on the Arctic?s carbon budget and the global climate system are poorly understood, as most observations have been made during the short growing season, when root and rhizosphere respiration dominate CO2 emissions.  This project will focus on the development of a new technology for the continuous collection of CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils. This passive diffusive sieve (zeolite) trap for measuring soil respired CO2 will be rugged, small, lightweight, low-cost, and require little in the way of power (batteries) low power.  It has the potential to transform our understanding of carbon cycling in the Arctic, as it allows for the year-round CO2 collection, including during the winter and shoulder seasons when sites are often inaccessible, and over multiple weeks (3 weeks/sample), thus integrating both diffusive and episodic emissions.  Outreach activities will strengthen the existing NSF-supported K-12 training programs at UC Irvine that are aimed to increase the participation of underprivileged populations in the STEM fields. THE Investigators will engage middle school students with lab tours and activities during a ?Day at College?-experience and class room visits. The project will also train a graduate student, and contribute to educating researchers (via an international summer course) in the use of 14C analysis in Ecology and Earth System Science.<br/><br/>The investigators will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  However, typical canister-based systems for measuring soil respired CO2, can be relatively large, expensive to ship, and require line power.  This project will develop and deploy a novel system to continuously trap CO2 emitted from Arctic tundra soils over several weeks for radiocarbon (14C) analysis.  This continuous collection system has the potential to transform carbon cycle research.  Such devices would obviate the need for shipping large canisters to the Arctic as well and the need for line power.  Moreover, such devices are relatively inexpensive and lightweight, and therefore, permit for high spatial resolution monitoring.  These new traps, however, have never been tested in the Arctic, where the environmental conditions can be harsh, especially in winter.  Thus the focus of this work is to develop, harden, and test such devices through a number of winter seasons at the Toolik Lake Long Term Ecological Station, on the north slope of Alaska.  If successful, this device will provide the first year-round, quasi-continuous dataset on soil-respired 14CO2 in moist acidic tussock tundra, which is the dominant tundra type of arctic Alaska and globally accounts for over 20% of the tundra land surface.  Moreover, this research will point the way for other experimental groups working in similar harsh environments throughout the Arctic."

There is growing consensus that Thwaites Glacier is unstable and vulnerable to collapse. However, there is significant disagreement in projections of rates of mass loss, with some studies suggesting century to millennial scale retreat and others forecasting more catastrophic disintegration. These disagreements are significant because rapid disintegration of Thwaites and adjacent glaciers could potentially trigger or accelerate collapse of significant portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with implications for global mean sea-level rise in the coming decades. Predicting rates of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is currently hampered by a lack of reliable models of ice fracture and breakaway--called iceberg calving--and the interactions between calving and climate change. This study addresses this major knowledge gap, and is motivated by the need to improve sea-level projections critical for policy and planning. Moreover, there is also a gap between what scientists assert about the usefulness of sea-level rise predictions and stakeholder's perceptions of the usability of that work. This project is also geared to address this gap, by identifying the information that is accessible and usable to a broad community of stakeholders whilst proactively engaging with under-represented communities at nearby community colleges and school districts, engaging community college students in research.  <br/><br/>Projected rates of sea-level rise from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (and Thwaites Glacier in particular) have large uncertainties due to difficulties in understanding and projecting the calving and dynamic processes that control the ice-sheet stability.  This uncertainty is magnified by the poorly understood connection between calving processes, ice-sheet stability and climate. To address these uncertainties, this project seeks to explicitly resolve the processes that could cause retreat and collapse of Thwaites Glacier using a novel ice-dynamics model suite.  This model suite includes a discrete element model capable of simulating coupled fracture and ice-flow processes, a 3D full Stokes continuum model, and the continental scale ice-dynamics model (BISICLES). Ice-dynamics models will be coupled to an ocean forcing model suite including simple plume models, intermediate complexity 2-layer ocean models and fully 3D regional ocean models. This hierarchical approach will use high-fidelity process models to inform and constrain the sequence of lower-order models needed to extrapolate improved understanding to larger scales and has the potential to radically reduce uncertainty of rates of marine ice-sheet collapse and associated sea-level rise. The large-scale modeling approach will be tested and implemented within the open source BISICLES ice dynamics model and made publicly available to other researchers via a ""calving package"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(1993) showed that Eriophorum vaginatum, the plant species that dominates arctic tussock tundra, not only can use organic N-sources, but actually grows better with amino acids as a sole N-source than with inorganic N salts. A challenge of this shifting view is that no one has actually quantified, for any plant species growing in the wild, and how much of E. vaginatum?s total N demand is met by organic N-sources! This project would quantify the forms of N it uses, as well as assessing organic nutrient dynamics in several other tundra communities. More broadly, this project would develop approaches for assessing organic nutrition more in other ecosystem types and so test the developing organic nutrition theory of N-limited plants. This project will support undergraduate education by integrating new material into classes at University California Santa Barbara, and by offering research experiences to a University California Santa Barbara undergraduate during year-1 and an Alaskan student to help with the field season in year-2. It will coordinate with the Toolik Long Term Ecosystem Research education program in creating a module on ""What Plants Eat."" The participants will work with the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum to develop a suite of activities that will engage the public to target three goals: 1. A better appreciation of the role of soil in our lives and ecosystems, 2. To understand the Arctic as a component of the Earth System, and 3. To better appreciate how science and scientists work and think.<br/><br/>The challenge to answering the question ""Do plants really use organic N?"" has been methodological. This project would use a combination of methods integrated through simulation modeling. The key novel method is microdialysis, in which a probe the size of a root is inserted into the soil, a carrier solution flows through it, and small molecules diffuse into it. Microdialysis will be coupled with intact root uptake kinetic studies, isotope partitioning, and analyzing diffusion and transport of amino acids, NH4+ and NO3- through soil to parameterize a root uptake model that will be used to synthesize and integrate the results. The first phase of the work will be done under controlled conditions in the greenhouse; then having refined the methods and assessed model parameters, the study will be moved into the field to assess seasonal patterns of N uptake and how it is affected by environmental manipulations.<br/>"

These traditional models changed as new methods allowed recognition of the importance of bacteria and other non-photosynthetic protozoa in more complex food webs. More recently, the wide-spread existence of mixotrophs (organisms that can both photosynthesize and ingest food particles) and their importance as microbial predators has been recognized in many oceanographic areas. In the Southern Ocean, the only two surveys of mixotrophs have suggested that there may be seasonal differences in their importance as predators. During the long polar night (winter), the ability of mixotrophs to ingest particulate food may aid in their survival thus ensuring a sufficient population in spring to support a phytoplankton bloom once photosynthesis rates can increase. Thus mixotrophs may provide a critical early food source upon which zooplankton and larger animals depend on for growth and reproduction. This project will advance understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact within the Southern Ocean microbial food web. Specifically, efforts will be focused on mixotrophy in the western Antarctica peninsula region during the austral spring and autumn when there are likely to be changes in the relative importance of photosynthesis and ingestion to mixotrophs. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. There will be real-time outreach from the Southern Ocean to the public via blogs and interviews, and to high school art students through an established program that blends science and art education. <br/><br/>Despite traditional views of protists as either ""phototrophic"" or ""heterotrophic,"" there are many photosynthetic protists that consume prey (mixotrophy). Mixotrophy is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic systems and phytoplankton groups with known mixotrophic species, notably chrysophytes, cryptophytes, prymnesiophytes, prasinophytes and dinoflagellates, are present and often abundant in Antarctic waters. However, in the Southern Ocean, the presence of mixotrophic phytoflagellates has been surveyed only twice: in the Ross Sea during Austral spring 2008 and summer 2011. The primary goals of the project are to gain better understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact with respect to the Southern Ocean microbial food web. The contribution of mixotrophs to primary production and bacterial consumption is likely linked to the taxonomic composition of the community and the abundance of particular species. Abundances of novel mixotrophic species will be evaluated via qPCR, which will be coupled with assessments of rates of feeding and photosynthesis with the goal of describing how active mixotrophs direct the movement of carbon through food webs. These experiments will help the determination of how viable and widespread mixotrophy is as a nutritional strategy in polar waters and give direct information on the currently unknown diversity of mixotrophic taxa under different environmental conditions occurring in austral spring and autumn. Furthermore, the methods will simultaneously yield information on the whole communities of protists - mixotrophic, phototrophic and heterotrophic. In addition, a method to examine aspects of the taxonomic and functional diversities of the bacterivorous/mixotrophic community will be employed. A thymidine analog (BrdU) will be used to label DNA of eukaryotes feeding on bacteria. The BrdU-labeled eukaryotic DNA will be isolated using immunoprecipitation. High-throughput sequencing of the labeled DNA (bacterivores) versus unlabeled community DNA will determine the diversity of bacterivorous mixotrophs relative to other microeukaryotes. Flow cytometric sorting based on chlorophyll to focus on mixotrophic species.

Layer by layer over hundreds of thousands of years, snow has precipitated on the ice sheet, become compacted, and turned into additional ice. Any dust or other impurities in the air or snow have been precipitated as well and thus each snowfall leaves a snapshot record of the atmosphere that existed at or near the time of deposition. A detailed chronology of volcanic eruptions can be obtained from the ice layers where ash and other volcanic products were deposited. Normally, the analysis of volcanic layers requires the physical extraction of a core from the ice sheet; however, chronologies from cores have discontinuities and are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to obtain. <br/>Borehole logging is a measurement method where one lowers instrumentation into a drilled hole in the ice, whether or not core has been retrieved. To date, this technology has only been used to measure optical systems to identify volcanic ash and other impurity layers. In this program, a profiling technology will be developed that measures the conductivity of the ice. A radio-frequency emitter lowered into the borehole will create a return signal that changes depending on the local conductivity, which depends on the concentration of dissolved ions. For example, dissolved sulfates are a critical marker of volcanic activity that may not be coincident with deposited ash. Other dissolved ions, such as chloride, can be indicative of other processes. It is expected that this borehole profiling instrument will be able to help rapidly identify volcanic eruptions that had potentially global impact, distinguish between different dissolved ions via their frequency dependencies, and assist in establishing chronologies between different ice cores and boreholes.<br/><br/><br/>Part II: Technical Description<br/>Borehole logging of the polar ice sheets is one of the most important methods that earth scientists have to identify and date volcanic eruptions. However, current technology only indicates the presence and depth of ash from an eruption. In order to extract more detailed information, one must obtain an ice core, and laboriously measure each section in the laboratory using electrical conductivity or dielectric measurements to determine the presence or absence of dissolved sulfate and its location relative to the corresponding ash, if any. This program will investigate and demonstrate a borehole logging-compatible radio-frequency dielectric sensor to detect and measure spikes in dissolved major ions chemistry in ice, particularly in intervals corresponding to volcanically produced sulfates. The sulfate layers are one of the primary signatures of volcanic products. However, other ions, such as chlorides, calcium, and others are also commonly seen in ice, and the dielectric logging technology of this program would also measure these. It is expected that certain sets of ions will be distinguishable by their frequency dependencies. This technique could guide other investigators, who are using conventional core scanning and sampling methods, to regions of special interest in corresponding core.<br/>We plan to construct a ring-based electrode system and test this system on a variety of artificial ice boreholes and ice cores. This unit will not include a pressure vessel or other borehole logger packing. We will test different means of applying electrical signals including short pulses and periodic waves. We will further utilize differential measurements with low noise circuits and filters to achieve maximum sensitivity. We will correlate the signals extracted with known molarities of sulfates and other ions and measured ECM records. We will perform scaled-down experiments using real ice cores stored in Bay?s lab at UC Berkeley.  This will permit testing of different designs in ice with natural impurities and polycrystalline structure. This small collection includes cores from a variety of locations in Antarctica and Greenland, and a variety of ages as old as a million years."

Experiments on a range of diatoms will be conducted in home laboratories and will be aimed at measuring shifts in physiological capacities over many generations in response to directional changes in the environment (temperature and pH).  The information on the genetic diversity of field populations combined with information on potential rates of adaptability and genome changes will provide insight into ways in which polar marine diatoms populations may respond to environmental changes that may occur in surface oceans in the future or may have occurred during past climate conditions.   Such information allows better modeling of biogeochemical cycles in the ocean as well as improves our abilities to interpret records of past ocean conditions. The project will support a doctoral student and a postdoctoral researcher as well as several undergraduate students. These scientists will learn the fundamentals of experimental evolution, a skill set that is being sought in the fields of biology and oceanography. The project also includes a collaboration with the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting that will design and facilitate a session focused on current research related to evolution and climate change to be held at the annual conference of the National Association of Science Writers (NASW). <br/><br/>Both physiological and genetic variation are key parameters for understanding evolutionary processes in phytoplankton but they are essentially unknown for Southern Ocean diatoms. The extent to which these two factors determine plasticity and adaptability in field populations and the interaction between them will influence how and whether cold-adapted diatoms can respond to changing environments.  This project includes a combination of field work to identify genetic diversity within diatoms using molecular approaches and experiments in the lab to assess the range of physiological variation in contemporary populations of diatoms and evolution experiments in the lab to assess how the combination of genetic diversity and physiological variation influence the evolutionary potential of diatoms under a changing environment.  This research will uncover general relationships between physiological variation, genetic diversity, and evolutionary potential that may apply across microbial taxa and geographical regions, substantially improving efforts to predict shifts in marine ecosystems.

These physical processes take place mainly on the Earth's dayside, generating electromagnetic waves in the outer magnetosphere that likely act as key agents in causing and/or modulating precipitation of energetic electrons responsible for the dayside auroral pulsations. For better understanding of these physical processes laying underneath the dayside auroral pulsations, it is essential to examine associations of the auroral structure variations with the dayside outer magnetospheric dynamics. <br/><br/>This award will significantly advance our understanding of the ultra-low frequency electromagnetic wave dynamics in the outer magnetosphere and their connection to the Earth's ionosphere and respective processes taking place there. This research was motivated by recent case studies that suggested connections between the dynamical behavior of daytime auroral pulsations being modulated by the kilo-electron-volts electron precipitation caused by the earthward-propagating compressional Pc3 waves of the upstream origin. This study will conduct the first critical observational test of the above hypothetical scenario via characterization of spatiotemporal properties of the dayside auroral pulsations in the two-dimensional perspective that will help addressing their association with the dynamic of outer magnetosphere layers. More specifically, the following science questions will be addressed: (a) what are the spatiotemporal properties of the dayside auroral pulsations, and (b) what are their occurrence rate, period, propagation direction, and correlation with the geomagnetic pulsations observed from the ground in the polar regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The higher (lower) the albedo, the lower (higher) is the amount of solar energy absorbed by the medium. Albedo plays a critical role on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where absorbed solar radiation is the dominant driver of surface melt during summer. The evolution of albedo on the Greenland Ice Sheet is primarily driven by changes in snow grain size, the presence of liquid water on the surface, the exposure of bare ice, and the presence of light-absorbing impurities in the snow and ice.  Such impurities include soot, dust, and biological constituents like bacteria and algae.  Interactions between biological impurities and snow physical processes (e.g., metamorphism and melt redistribution) are important because they can drive positive feedbacks in which total melt is amplified. <br/><br/>Despite their importance, these processes relating biological constituents to snow and ice evolution are currently either absent or poorly represented in models used to simulate current estimates and future projections of the contribution of Greenland to sea level rise. Through an interdisciplinary and collaborative effort, this project will integrate state of the art knowledge of how biological activity impacts albedo into climate models. This will help reduce uncertainties of the contribution of Greenland to sea level rise and will also improve our understanding of interactions between the ice sheet and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The regional climate and Earth System models that will be applied in our study are open-source models, such as e.g., the Community Earth System Model).

By taking advantage of simultaneous satellite-ground conjunctions in recent years, this award will help determining the source region of dayside density modulations, specifically addressing three outstanding scientific questions: Where does the enhanced density originate? How do enhanced density regions evolve in time? And what is the typical size of the enhanced density regions?<br/><br/>The plasma density in the dayside magnetosphere is highly structured, and this structure can have a large impact on the excitation of whistler-mode waves that in turn scatter plasma sheet electrons drifting from the nightside and accelerate electrons in the Earth's radiation belts. It has been recently found that whistler-mode waves drive structured patches of the diffuse aurora; this can be used to highlight enhanced density regions in the dayside magnetosphere. The dayside 'aurora-wave-density' correlations lead to questions about the origin of enhanced plasma density patches and their propagation in the dayside magnetosphere. Satellite observations alone have difficulties separating spatial and temporal effects in tracing the motion of enhanced density regions, but ground-based 2D auroral imaging could offer an excellent technique for monitoring the shape and motion of diffuse aurora that is driven by precipitating energetic electrons interacting with whistler-mode waves. <br/><br/>The proposed investigation will use a creative approach for understanding dayside magnetospheric density evolution by using Antarctic-based auroral observations. In particular, South Pole is an ideal dayside auroral observatory due to its longest polar night in the world. The wave-particle interaction producing whistler-mode waves will be used as a tool for imaging dayside plasma density structures using correlated South Pole all-sky auroral imager and THEMIS spacecraft observations. This research may influence not only its own field of diffuse auroral studies, but also related fields such as dayside magnetospheric dynamics, wave particle interactions, and excitation of plasma waves. <br/><br/>This interesting and important scientific research provides an ideal opportunity to train a graduate student, further scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and create a list of THEMIS-South Pole auroral imager 'dayside conjunction' events and respective geomagnetic field mapping results for the use by a broader geospace science community."

This is also the region where Norse settlements were abandoned by the early-15th century; many questions still remain about the causative factors. Although climate change is often cited as the reason for settlement failure, this explanation rests on a very poorly constrained scientific foundation and other explanations have also been proposed.   Inferences about climatic conditions in the region often have been derived from far distant sources, generally at high elevations on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where climatic conditions are completely different.  This project will produce records with multidecadal (15-25 year) resolution from the study region, spanning the last 1500-2000 years.  This will be accomplished using new organic geochemical techniques and will contribute to the calibration and understanding of these methodologies.  <br/><br/>This project will partially support a productive young scientist during the formative years of her career.  It will also provide support for the training of a graduate student.  The principal investigators (PIs) will contribute to a University of Massachusetts summer program designed to engage 12 to 18 year old girls, most from under-represented or low income groups, in STEM fields.  The PIs and the supported graduate student will participate in university-sponsored middle and high school teacher training programs.  Finally, undergraduate honors students often participate in the activities of co-PI's lab.  She expects that a number of honors theses and senior projects will result from the research associated with this project.  All of this contributes to development of the nation's STEM workforce.  The project will continue an established international collaboration with French scientists.  The disappearance of the Norse communities in Greenland and its potential linkage to climate change have significant human interest upon which the PIs propose to capitalize.  Their proposed outreach activities include composing articles for popular science magazines and development of a project web site.

The new hydrological regime is result of an increase in annual precipitation, a higher proportion of which is in the form of rain rather than snow, especially in the transition seasons of fall and spring.

However, there is increasing recognition that mixotrophs, which combine phototrophy and heterotrophy in a single organism, are important components of planktonic food webs.  Based on prior work, the investigators have confirmed the ubiquitous nature of mixotrophs in Arctic and Antarctic waters and hypothesize that a possible consequence to the warming of Arctic surface waters is that pico- and nano-mixotrophs will become more abundant in the region.  Using water samples from across the Arctic, the investigators will conduct laboratory experiments to better understand the environmental conditions that trigger mixotrophic activity.  Such experiments will also provide information on how the microbial food web will function in a warming climate and how such changes will potentially affect higher trophic levels, such as fish. This work will provide a possibly transformative re-orienting of our current view of surface water food webs structure and dynamics and nutrient flows in a changing Arctic.  The project will train a post doctoral scientist, graduate, and undergraduate student.  In addition, the project includes outreach to local schools in urban Philadelphia, and collaboration with a Falmouth, MA. high school art teacher as part of novel art-science projects (STEAM).<br/><br/>As Arctic water temperatures warm, the investigators predict a two-fold effect on the marine food web.  First, they predict an increased contribution to primary production from pico- and nano-phytoplankton.  Second, they predict an impact on bacterial consumption owing to the fact that many of the pico- and nano-phytoplankton species exhibit mixotrophic behavior.  The investigators propose a number of laboratory experiments on strains of algal groups that have been identified as mixotrophic species and are found in Arctic waters.  Arctic marine isolates will be acquired from the Roscoff Culture Collection and the National Center of Marine Algae.  Species specific mixotrophic activity and grazing rates will be determined across a range of environmental conditions that trigger and/or stimulate mixotrophy, such as high/low light and high/low nutrients.   From these species specific measurements, along with qPCR analysis to determine species abundances in water samples from across the Arctic marine environment, the potential impact of mixotrophic activity can be assessed on an Arctic-wide basis.  Finally, to determine and compare the levels of mixotrophic activity in environmental samples without relying on ingestion experiments the investigators will develop a gene-based method of activity based upon RNA sequencing and the results of the environmental response experiments discussed above.  This will be important for prediction in a warmer world."

Layers of volcanic ash (tephra) embedded in glacial ice can be used to establish an accurate ice core chronology. In order to use a visible or ultrafine volcanic ash layer as a time-stratigraphic marker, a unique geochemical fingerprint must be established, and this forms the basis of our research. This award will investigate the volcanic record in the 1751 m ice core that was completed at the South Pole during the 2015/16 field season. The core is in an ideal location to link the existing, established, volcanic records in East and West Antarctica, and therefore to connect and integrate those records, allowing the climate records of ice cores to be directly compared, as well as to focus research on the most widespread and significant volcanic eruptions from West Antarctica.  Tephra derived from well-dated, large, tropical volcanic eruptions that may have had an impact on climate will also be studied.   Recent success in identifying and analyzing very fine ash particles from these types of eruptions makes it likely that we will be able to pinpoint some of these eruptions, which will allow the sulfate peaks associated with these layers to be positively identified and dated. Volcanic forcing time series developed from earlier South Pole ice cores based on preserved sulfate were crucial for testing climate models, but without tephra analysis, the origin of these layers remains uncertain. <br/><br/>Work on the tephra layers in the South Pole ice core has a number of significant specific objectives, some with practical applications to the basic science goals of Antarctic ice coring, and others that represent independent scientific contributions in their own right. These include: (1) providing independently dated time-intervals in the core, particularly for the deepest ice, (2) quantitatively linking tephra records across Antarctica with the goal of allowing direct and robust climate comparisons between these different parts of the continent, (3) providing information for large local eruptions, that will lead to direct estimates of eruption magnitude and dispersal patterns of Antarctic volcanoes, several of which will likely erupt again. The initial stages of the work will be carried out by identifying silicate-bearing horizons in the ice core, using several methods.  Once found, silicate particles will be imaged so that morphological characteristics of the particles can be used to identify volcanic origin.  Particles identified as tephra will then be chemically analyzed using electron microprobe and laser ablation ICP-MS.  Samples that yield a robust chemical fingerprint will be statistically correlated to known eruptions, and this will be used to address the goals described above.  Broader impacts of this project fall into the areas of education of future generation of researchers, outreach and international cooperation. These activities will continue to promote forward progress in integrating the Antarctic tephra record and more broadly tying it to the global volcanic record."

Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the contradiction between what scientists expect to see based on computer models and physical intuition and the growth that is recorded in observations. This study will examine the hypothesis that sea ice expansion can be explained by sea ice motion, where sea ice moves in such a way as to promote an increase in overall coverage. Researchers will use several different types of computer models, ranging in complexity, to better understand the physical processes of sea ice motion and how the sea ice motion interacts with the larger atmosphere-ocean system.

The hierarchy will consist of (i) an idealized single-column model of sea ice evolution, (ii) an idealized latitudinally-varying global model of sea ice and climate, (iii) an atmospheric global climate model (GCM) above a slab ocean that includes sea ice motion, (iv) a comprehensive GCM, and (v) model output from the suite of current comprehensive GCMs. The range of model complexities will help researchers better understand the relationship between sea ice motion and sea ice extent by allowing them to identify important processes that are robust across the model hierarchy."

The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of the largest uncertainties in projections of sea-level change. Thwaites Glacier (TG) is a primary contributor to sea-level rise and its flow is accelerating. This faster flow is a response to reduced buttressing from its thinning, floating ice shelf, and is ultimately caused by ocean-driven melting. The degree to which costly and geopolitically-challenging sea-level rise will occur therefore hangs to a large extent on ice-ocean interactions beneath such Antarctic ice shelves. However, the Thwaites system is not sufficiently well understood, exposing a significant gap in our understanding of WAIS retreat, its ocean-driven forcing, and the consequences for sea level.  The chief regulators of TG's retreat are ice and ocean processes in its grounding zone, the location where the ice flowing from inland goes afloat. Ice and ocean processes at this precise locale are central to our understanding of sea-level rise, yet key variables have not been constrained by observation. Model projections of TG's future display extreme sensitivity to melting in the grounding zone and how that melting is applied. Equally-credible melt rates and grounding-zone glaciological treatments yield divergent trajectories for the future of West Antarctica, ranging from little change to large-scale ice sheet collapse with a half a meter or more of sea-level rise. The enormous uncertainty in outcome stems from the lack of observations in this critical grounding zone region.  The enhanced understanding of melting of TG's ice shelf that will come from this project's focused observational program will be built into state-of-the-art coupled ice-sheet and ocean models. These physics-rich, high-resolution models will allow the potential sea-level contribution of TG to be bounded to an unprecedented degree.<br/><br/>This project will enable global and regional climate modelers to make a substantial improvement to projections of future ocean conditions over the continental shelf by providing physics-based projections of TG's sea-level contribution. The team proposes a suite of integrated activities: (1) multi-year oceanographic time series from beneath TG's ice shelf to quantify melting processes that need inclusion in ocean models, with a strong focus on the grounding zone, (2) analogous measurements on the glacier to validate processes governing grounding-line retreat, (3) coupling of these in situ measurements with novel, high-resolution space-borne observations, (4) building this new understanding into state-of-the-art ocean (MIT General Circulation Model and Imperial College Ocean Model) and ice sheet (WAVI) models to correctly simulate the TG system, (5) coupling the models and running with realistic present-day ocean forcing to project the state of TG basin over the next hundred years. The international team will use a range of techniques, from the well-established, such as using a hot-water drill to instrument the ice column and water column in the grounding zone, through to the cutting-edge, such as deploying a borehole deployable remotely operated vehicle to survey the grounding zone, and using phase-coherent radar to monitor ice strain and basal melt rates. The outcome of the project will be a more complete understanding of the TG system in the critical zone extending from a few kilometers inland of the grounding line, through the grounding zone, and out under the ice shelf.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen has an impact on both air quality and climate, due to its role as a precursor for tropospheric ozone and stratospheric water vapor. Projections indicate that a future ""hydrogen economy"" would increase hydrogen emissions.  Understanding of the atmospheric hydrogen budget is largely based on a 30-year record of surface air measurements, but there are no long-term records with which to assess either: 1) the influence of climate change on atmospheric hydrogen, or 2) the extent to which humans have impacted the hydrogen budget. Polar ice core records of hydrogen will advance our understanding of the atmospheric hydrogen cycle and provide a stronger basis for projecting future changes to atmospheric levels of hydrogen and their impacts. <br/><br/>The research will involve laboratory work to enable the collection and analysis of hydrogen in polar ice cores. Hydrogen is a highly diffusive molecule and, unlike most other atmospheric gases, diffusion of hydrogen in ice is so rapid that ice samples must be stored in impermeable containers immediately upon drilling and recovery. This project will: 1) construct a laboratory system for extracting and analyzing hydrogen in polar ice, 2) develop and test materials and construction designs for vessels to store ice core samples in the field, and 3) test the method on samples of opportunity previously stored in the field. The goal of this project is a proven, cost-effective design for storage flasks to be fabricated for use on future polar ice coring projects.

The fast pace of these changes has prompted concern because boreal forests make up about a third of all forests worldwide, contain almost half of the world's stored carbon, and have been historically stable with black spruce dominating this landscape for the past 6,000 years. Warming of 2-8 C is projected by the end of the century and the emergence of a new fire regime threatens to disrupt this forest ecosystem. For example, in some regions of interior Alaska, the fire return interval has decreased to 10-50 years, causing shifts from black spruce to deciduous trees and grasses. Changes in the climate and fire regime are also expected to affect global carbon cycling since fires and thawing of frozen soils (permafrost) may release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. This research will incorporate field studies and computer simulations to determine how fire frequency and climate change affect shifts between vegetation types (e.g. switch from conifer to grasses) and long term carbon storage in this vast and under-studied region. The study will train graduate students and involve Native American high school students from the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (RAHI) in field work. The investigators will collaborate with Your World Rocks (YWR), a nonprofit organization of female scientists and engineers dedicated to promoting science education in elementary schools. They will develop hands-on activities focusing on climate change, forests, and fire and conduct free hands-on activities in elementary schools in the greater Portland/Vancouver metro area, with a particular focus on underserved Title 1 schools. <br/><br/>The fast pace of climate warming and an increase in fire frequency over the past few decades in northern latitudes has raised concerns about major shifts in vegetation and the long-term ability of ecosystems to capture and store carbon. Boreal forest ecosystems account for about 33% of all forests worldwide and contain about 45% of the world's carbon stocks, with the majority (~85%) stored belowground. For the past 6,000 years, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) has been the dominant species over a large proportion of this landscape, exhibiting substantial resilience to changes in climate. However, unprecedented warming (causing earlier snowmelt, permafrost thawing, and longer growing seasons) and the emergence of a new fire regime over the past 60 years threatens to disrupt the existing dominance by black spruce and release globally significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The goal of this research is to quantify the potential for large-scale changes in carbon (C) sink strength, C stocks, and vegetation in boreal forests due to climate change and repeated wildfires by integrating mechanistic field and lab work with dynamic, spatially explicit landscape modeling. Working in central Alaska, the investigators will: 1) determine how fire frequency and climate change affect successional trajectories and above- and belowground C cycling, and 2) assess how the mechanisms that cause tipping points between vegetation types (i.e. conifer, hardwood, graminoid) and C sequestration (i.e. sink, source) vary spatially and temporally. To achieve these objectives, the investiagors will empirically measure above- and belowground C stocks, productivity, heterotrophic respiration, soil temperature and moisture content, and active layer thickness in the field and quantify C mineralization using laboratory soil incubations. They will also develop and validate a physically based permafrost/hydrology module for a widely-used, high resolution landscape simulation model (LANDIS-II) to forecast long-term dynamics of species composition and C source/sink status given projected changes in climate (including thawing permafrost) and fire. The work will improve our understanding of how C cycling and species composition in boreal forests will respond to climate change and disturbances at the fine spatial scales critical to accurately project the future of the boreal forest."

The SIZ extends all the way around Antarctica and it is here that sea-ice manufacture and export leads to brine rejection and loss of buoyancy in the water column. In this way cold surface waters are preconditioned for subsequent convection, mixing and entrainment in coastal polynyas, under ice shelves and over the continental slope of Antarctica. The transformed (densified) waters ultimately make up Antarctic Bottom Water feeding the lower cell of the Southern Ocean (SO), connecting to the abyssal oceans. Despite the importance of the SIZ in driving the meridional circulation of the ocean-atmosphere climate system, its dynamics is not well observed, modeled or understood. This study seeks to model the fluid dynamics of the seasonal cycle of sea-ice formation in a strongly eddying region next to the continental shelf.<br/><br/>The broad impacts of the research center upon the Antarctic being a system of such great importance to global ocean circulation, and to climate. The study intends to bring together theory, observations and models to address the contemporary problem of uptake of heat to the abyssal ocean, and will provide a challenging context for the education of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in interdisciplinary science.

The higher (lower) the albedo, the lower (higher) is the amount of solar energy absorbed by the medium. Albedo plays a critical role on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where absorbed solar radiation is the dominant driver of surface melt during summer. The evolution of albedo on the Greenland Ice Sheet is primarily driven by changes in snow grain size, the presence of liquid water on the surface, the exposure of bare ice, and the presence of light-absorbing impurities in the snow and ice.  Such impurities include soot, dust, and biological constituents like bacteria and algae.  Interactions between biological impurities and snow physical processes (e.g., metamorphism and melt redistribution) are important because they can drive positive feedbacks in which total melt is amplified. <br/><br/>Despite their importance, these processes relating biological constituents to snow and ice evolution are currently either absent or poorly represented in models used to simulate current estimates and future projections of the contribution of Greenland to sea level rise. Through an interdisciplinary and collaborative effort, this project will integrate state of the art knowledge of how biological activity impacts albedo into climate models. This will help reduce uncertainties of the contribution of Greenland to sea level rise and will also improve our understanding of interactions between the ice sheet and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The regional climate and Earth System models that will be applied in our study are open-source models, such as e.g., the Community Earth System Model). Model improvements that are implemented will be released for use by other researchers in a timely way.

These measurements of neutral-ion coupling and Joule heating, in the critical region above 100 km, are an objective of highest priority for the upper atmosphere science community. Development of the neutral atmosphere temperature climatology is crucial for calibrating satellite observations of the polar mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) region and validating global climate models; in decades from now this climatology records will serve as the baseline against which long-term temperature trends in the changing Antarctic climate are assessed. The studies of extreme summertime Fe events and solar effects on Fe-layer's bottom side are improving the understanding of iron chemistry at polar latitudes. The vertical heat and constituent flux observations with the lidars are enhancing the knowledge of wave-induced transport in the polar mesopause region and remove the greatest source of uncertainty in current chemical-dynamical models of the mesospheric metal layers. This also led to improvements in quantitative estimates of the cosmic dust input that has implications for a variety of geophysical processes throughout the Antarctic atmosphere and Southern Ocean. The characterization and analysis of the gravity wave field in the neutral atmosphere above McMurdo are advancing the understanding of wave coupling in the MLT region and provide better constraints on wave parameterization schemes in climate models. Thus, the McMurdo lidar campaigns provide a new look into the composition, chemistry, temperature, and dynamics of the polar upper atmosphere in a critical latitudinal gap region mid-way between the South Pole and Antarctic Circle. The Fe-Boltzmann lidar has already produced a rich dataset stored in the CEDAR/Madrigal database, which is readily available to other scientists to help supporting their own research on polar aeronomy and climate. This project provides exceptional opportunities to train students and young researchers by giving them fieldwork experience in Antarctica. The project also enhances classroom teaching and graduate programs at several prominent universities around the world."

These traditional models changed as new methods allowed recognition of the importance of bacteria and other non-photosynthetic ?protozoa? in more complex food webs. More recently, the wide-spread existence of mixotrophs (organisms that can both photosynthesize and ingest food particles) and their importance as microbial predators has been recognized in many oceanographic areas. In the Southern Ocean, the only two surveys of mixotrophs have suggested that there may be seasonal differences in their importance as predators. During the long polar night (winter), the ability of mixotrophs to ingest particulate food may aid in their survival thus ensuring a sufficient population in spring to support a phytoplankton bloom once photosynthesis rates can increase. Thus mixotrophs may provide a critical early food source upon which zooplankton and larger animals depend on for growth and reproduction. This project will advance understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact within the Southern Ocean microbial food web. Specifically, efforts will be focused on mixotrophy in the western Antarctica peninsula region during the austral spring and autumn when there are likely to be changes in the relative importance of photosynthesis and ingestion to mixotrophs. The project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher. There will be real-time outreach from the Southern Ocean to the public via blogs and interviews, and to high school art students through an established program that blends science and art education. <br/><br/>Despite traditional views of protists as either ""phototrophic"" or ""heterotrophic,"" there are many photosynthetic protists that consume prey (mixotrophy). Mixotrophy is a widespread phenomenon in aquatic systems and phytoplankton groups with known mixotrophic species, notably chrysophytes, cryptophytes, prymnesiophytes, prasinophytes and dinoflagellates, are present and often abundant in Antarctic waters. However, in the Southern Ocean, the presence of mixotrophic phytoflagellates has been surveyed only twice: in the Ross Sea during Austral spring 2008 and summer 2011. The primary goals of the project are to gain better understanding of mixotroph diversity and their ecological impact with respect to the Southern Ocean microbial food web. The contribution of mixotrophs to primary production and bacterial consumption is likely linked to the taxonomic composition of the community and the abundance of particular species. Abundances of novel mixotrophic species will be evaluated via qPCR, which will be coupled with assessments of rates of feeding and photosynthesis with the goal of describing how active mixotrophs direct the movement of carbon through food webs. These experiments will help the determination of how viable and widespread mixotrophy is as a nutritional strategy in polar waters and give direct information on the currently unknown diversity of mixotrophic taxa under different environmental conditions occurring in austral spring and autumn. Furthermore, the methods will simultaneously yield information on the whole communities of protists - mixotrophic, phototrophic and heterotrophic. In addition, a method to examine aspects of the taxonomic and functional diversities of the bacterivorous/mixotrophic community will be employed. A thymidine analog (BrdU) will be used to label DNA of eukaryotes feeding on bacteria. The BrdU-labeled eukaryotic DNA will be isolated using immunoprecipitation. High-throughput sequencing of the labeled DNA (bacterivores) versus unlabeled community DNA will determine the diversity of bacterivorous mixotrophs relative to other microeukaryotes. Flow cytometric sorting based on chlorophyll to focus on mixotrophic species. These approaches will elucidate a gap in current knowledge of the influence of microbial interactions in the Southern Ocean under different conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Black carbon (BC) is a primary climate forcing agent resulting from incomplete combustion of biomass. Wildfire emissions are critical unknowns in climate-model predictions under a warming climate, particularly the relationship of large-scale biomass burning and BC emissions to climate forcing. Development of the ice-core BC method has transformed understanding of BC in polar regions; this project will further develop the sediment-core BC method and apply it to provide additional records that will expand temporal and spatial coverage to other regions, including development of detailed lake-sediment records of Arctic BC during the past ~1.4 million years thereby extending understanding of climate and biomass-burning linkages. This will enable worldwide, longer-term understanding of linkages between climate, human activities, and biomass burning, as well as quantification of BC as a forcing agent. BC aggregates reflect regional-to-hemispheric biomass burning emissions rather than local biomass burning. Given the sparsity of ice-coring locations in the eastern Arctic, application of this new lake sediment method in Arctic Russia will enable widely distributed records of past biomass burning and BC forcing in the region, potentially transforming understanding of forcing scenarios through time. Analysis of samples from Lake El'gygytgyn will extend biomass burning records much farther back in time than is possible with ice cores or charcoal records. The development and interdisciplinary interpretation of such long-term BC records will greatly extend instrumental records of biomass burning and BC in space and time - through a broad range of climate states and forcing scenarios - in line with the goals of NSF's Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) program.<br/><br/>This project will exploit the availability of archived lake sediment samples from the eastern Arctic and use this new method to (1) develop ~2,000-year-long records of BC, which is related to biomass burning in the eastern Arctic, to determine linkages between climate, human activities, BC, and biomass burning in the region; (2) evaluate the validity of the lake sediment method of measuring BC for different climate states by comparing BC flux and particle mass in the upper ~150,000 years of the Lake El'gygytgyn sediment core with a reprocessed ~120,000-year BC record from the Greenland NEEM ice core; and, (3) quantify and understand linkages between long-term and large-magnitude climate change, BC, and biomass burning in the eastern Arctic by developing a detailed sediment BC record from Lake El'gygytgyn during the past ~1.4 million years (spanning Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 1 to MIS 45). To meet the goals of this project, BC concentration and particle mass measurements will be made in lake sediment samples from an array of shorter, higher-time-resolution cores from the Russian Arctic, as well as from deeper, lower-time resolution lake cores, including the upper ~60 m of the Lake El'gygytgyn core. Pilot BC measurements from Lake E sediment cores for the past 160,000 years show close correspondence with large-scale climate (e.g., insolation, greenhouse gas concentrations) but suggest different climate-vegetation-fire relationships during the glacial periods than reported for the Holocene interglacial.

This project builds a unique partnership between an Alaska Native community, an Alaska Native archaeologist and students at Bates College to explore an important archaeological site in Southwest Alaska, Temyiq Turyuraq (Old Togiak).  The site was evaluated as simply a midden (village dump) by archaeologists in 1960. In 2015 and 2017, working closely with the Togiak community, including Bates undergraduates, Togiak Elders, and village students, the site was mapped with a variety of geophysical methods and reanalyzed and found to contain more than 70 traditional-style residential structures. In addition, this site was found to have been occupied for more than 2000 years up to the present, as represented by the Yup'ik community of Tuyuryaq (Togiak), a community comprised of more than 800 residents. Drawing unique insights from community members the project will address questions such as demography, cultural continuity, development of adaptive behaviors during climate instability and inter/intra village relationships.<br/><br/>This award will support a long-term collaborative archaeological project with the community of Tuyuryaq (Togiak), Alaska.

Research will contribute toward understanding how humans respond to environmental change, and evaluate the sensitivity and resilience of settlements in marginal locations. Arctic Norway is an important region for socio-ecological research because early settlements were at the northern limits for agriculture and had mixed agricultural and maritime economies that were susceptible to changes in climate and sea level. Research will be conducted at sites in the Lofoten Islands, where settlements developed from small pioneering agricultural outposts to prominent nodes of power and trade under Viking chiefdoms during the Iron Age (c. 500 BC-AD 1100). The collapse of these cheifdoms occurred during the late Iron Age at which time these societies were associated with westward migrations to other North Atlantic islands, which helped spread agricultural, maritime, and cultural knowledge that was subsequently adapted to suit these new environments. The Iron Age in Arctic Norway therefore marks an important period in the human history of the North Atlantic and outstanding questions remain concerning the role of environmental changes (both natural and anthropogenic) in this history that paved the way for North Atlantic expansion.<br/><br/>The proposed project will take an interdisciplinary, geo-archaeological approach to reconstruct human-environment interactions. Scientists and students from the College of William & Mary and Columbia University will work alongside Norwegian archaeologists to: compile and synthesize a large number of Iron Age archaeological studies, using mostly unpublished information within Norwegian cultural heritage databases, in order to assess the influence of natural environmental changes within an informed cultural framework, and develop continuous, high-resolution reconstructions of human impacts on the landscape by using lake sediments recovered near key settlements and by applying biogeochemical techniques to directly link human activity with landscape changes. The main objectives are: (1) to establish a more comprehensive understanding of cultural development during the Iron Age, particularly with respect to environmental changes, (2) document the changing patterns of human settlement as the region transformed to a center of power and trade, and (3) test the hypothesis that climate variability and sea-level variations had an impact on patterns of human settlement. The project will also promote teaching and training by engaging undergraduate students in international and interdisciplinary research. It will create strong partnerships among institutions within the U.S. and in Norway, and has outreach components that involve public lectures and the development of a comprehensive museum exhibit that will significantly promote learning and communication of archaeological and environmental sciences with the general public."

Although attention is often placed on US political and economic policy, individual Americans have also served to carry ideas to the North and to bring knowledge of these remote regions back to the United States and to a broader global audience. American artists, photographers and writers that ventured to the Arctic in the first half of the 20th Century captured some of the first widely seen images of Arctic landscapes and the Peoples that inhabit the region, creating lasting representations of an area of the world unknown to the majority of the public. These photographs, writing and other visual materials continue to shape how the Arctic is understood today and serve as lasting records of the changes the region and its Peoples have experienced over the past 100 years. One such individual is Rockwell Kent, an American artist and writer who resided in Greenland in the early 1930's and produced an extensive collection of photographs, art, and literature about his time in the country. Kent?s work and its contemporary influence illustrates the connected history of United States and Greenland and the continued relationship between the two counties. <br/><br/>This collaborative project combines anthropological, visual, and historical methodologies to approach how social, cultural and environmental changes and continuities are constructed and experienced in Greenland. The project centers around the work of Rockwell Kent with Kent's photos and art used as a starting point to engage contemporary community members in the study communities of Illorsuit, Sisimiut, Nuuk, and Uummannaq and discuss how social, cultural and environmental changes as well as continuities with the past are understood and defined. On a broader level, the project will address issues of representation of the Arctic and Northern populations. Historical photographs of the North have primarily been produced by foreign explorers, artists, and travelers that entered the region for specific purposes over limited periods of time. Yet, the visual products they left behind are often utilized with far less criticism than their writings as resources for constructing the history of the region and its Peoples. This project will examine the role of historical photographs in the production of the past and the present and their relationship to contemporary notions of social, cultural and environmental change in the Arctic. Kent's works as well as his relationship with Greenlanders will be examined through interviews with decedents, oral histories, written correspondence between Kent and Greenlanders and Danes and articles and letters-to-the-editor found in historic Greenlandic language newspapers. This work will provide a clearer view of Kent, one of the few Americans living and working in Greenland at the time, his relationship with the country and its peoples, and insight into how Greenlanders viewed Kent and his work in the 1930s. These findings will be discussed with community members and photographic workshops will be held in each community with students to encourage contemporary youth to produce their own representations of their communities. Student photos will be displayed and discussed alongside Kent's original works and contemporary documentary photographs by PI Defibaugh in community exhibitions. The visual works will be utilized as vehicles to discuss representations of Greenland, Inuit cultures, and constructions of continuity and change, including environmental, social, and cultural shifts from the 1930s to the present, a period of rapid transition not only in Greenland but across the Arctic. Overall, this project will contribute to a greater understanding of how visual media, produced in the past and in the present by both foreigners and community members, become intertwined in the constructions of contemporary Greenland and Greenlandic identities as well as contributing to our understanding of historical and contemporary relationship between the United States and Greenland.   <br/><br/>In keeping with Arctic Social Sciences Program initiatives, this project will provide a comparative study, partnerships between researchers and develop educational and interactive collaborations with community residents. Educational exchange and collaboration, between community members, students and researchers, is the foundation for this research. Workshops, held in each study community, will teach students photographic techniques and allow them to produce their own images that will be displayed and discussed, contributing to a locally produced record of ethnic and regional identities in relation to environmental, cultural, and social change. Public exhibitions and discussions of these contemporary photos, Kent's historical works and the research process will also allow for further collaborations between researchers from various disciplines and community members through an interactive and multimedia forum, strengthening the community's role in the research process and allowing multiple perspectives to be expressed and explored. As a result, this project will provide significant academic contributions and visual documentation of contemporary Greenland as well as important public outreach and dissemination activities. The project will further the development of interactive community-based participatory research methodologies in the Arctic and will have a crucial student research training and capacity-building aspect in the form of collaboration with researchers and students from US institutions, Rochester Institute of Technology and Binghamton University (SUNY) in New York, and Ilisimatusarfik (University of Greenland) in Nuuk, Greenland."

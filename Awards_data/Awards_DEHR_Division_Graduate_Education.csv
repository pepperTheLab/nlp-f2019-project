To fully realize these benefits will require a workforce with the technical skills to extract useful information from massive scientific data sets, calling for new approaches to graduate student training that emphasize expertise in data-driven science. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California Irvine (UCI) will tackle this challenge by creating a training ecosystem comprised of leading UCI, national-laboratory, and private-sector researchers across particle physics, earth science, chemistry, statistics and machine learning; all bound together by expertise in the emerging Science of Team Science. The project anticipates training over sixty (60) MS and PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, from diverse backgrounds in computational statistics, machine learning, earth science, particle physics, synthetic chemistry, and team science. After graduation, students from this program will have both the technical and team-science skills to be leaders in the emerging field of data-driven science, and to participate in and lead interdisciplinary research teams at national laboratories, in academia, and in industry labs.<br/><br/>The research agenda of the program seeks to create the foundation from which bridges can be built between the traditional scientific route of building interpretable models based on physical principles and data-driven modeling approaches that can provide high fidelity predictions but may lack clear interpretability in terms of the underlying science. The program will involve a number of interrelated research themes across multiple disciplines in the information and physical sciences, including machine learning (e.g. temporal and spatial data modeling, multi-scale models, deep learning, and scalable learning algorithms), particle and astroparticle physics (e.g. accelerator based experiments), earth systems science (e.g. reducing ecosystem response prediction uncertainties), and chemistry (e.g. prediction of physical properties of small molecules). A significant aspect of the program is an emphasis on team science as a core theme. Students will collaborate in small interdisciplinary research teams consisting of students and faculty with different disciplinary skills, and will take part in team-science workshops leading to student-led development of a team-science certificate in years 3 to 5 of the program. Summer internships for student participants, at both national and industry research laboratories, will serve to reinforce the students' academic training via participation in large-scale interdisciplinary data science research projects.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

Within this data-rich context, incoming STEM graduate students with different levels of data science and STEM training can complicate curricular approaches for mastery of data science techniques.  Linear and uniform preparation models may even widen the performance gap among students with diverse levels of preparation. This issue might be circumvented by replacing traditional ""one-size-fits-all"" course content with personalized electronic training modules that are tailored to each student's unique strengths, weaknesses, and training goals.  This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education award to Penn State University aims to develop, test, and refine a set of digital educational tools brought together by the Individualized Pathways and Resources to Adaptive Control Theory-Inspired Scientific Education system (iPRACTISE). The goal of iPRACTISE is to direct each student toward a personally optimized training pathway for mastery of data science techniques. The iPRACTISE system will allow students to specify their own learning goals, provide customized assessments to evaluate their performance levels, and guide them to educational resources that help them reach their goals. In this way, the iPRACTISE system serves as an initial proof-of-concept for a personalized, digital graduate educational system that could be adapted for use in a broad array of educational settings to enhance individual learning.<br/><br/>Personalized education can be viewed as a control theory problem in which students seek ongoing input, such as classes, curricular resources and training exercises to minimize the discrepancies between their actual and targeted levels of expertise. The iPRACTISE system will include: (1) digital training materials curated from existing teaching resources and a user-interface for instructors to populate the system with new training materials; (2) a user interface to specify training goals; (3) a computerized assessment system that evaluates students' current ability levels; and (4) control theory algorithms that automate the delivery of optimal, individualized training modules. The project will collect test data from a calibration sample consisting of graduate and advanced undergraduate students from multiple campuses at Penn State University to develop and test the assessment system (for evaluating student competency) and the control theory algorithm (for making personalized recommendations on training contents). After initial calibration, the iPRACTISE system offerings will be expanded and learning outcomes compared across diverse student cohorts. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.  The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The greatest challenges and opportunities arise from socially-generated big data, observed as a result of human interactions that are increasingly recorded via web, mobile device, and distributed sensors, or revealed through digitization of historical records. Society faces a transformative data deluge, from which new scientific, economic, and social value can be extracted. The BDSS-IGERT project includes a new curriculum, training in advanced technologies of data science and analytics, a series of research rotations ? in both academic and nonacademic settings ? and a challenge mechanism, under which interdisciplinary teams compete to innovate solutions to real social data analytics problems. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A recent report estimated that big data contain unexploited economic value over $1 trillion annually, but that 165,000 positions in ""deep analytics"" will need to be filled. Government statistics agencies need to produce useful statistical products, at lower cost, while protecting confidentiality. Big data technologies like crisis mapping present opportunities to address grand social challenges. Further, the BDSS-IGERT project expands the participation of underrepresented groups in data science, by combining an exciting new field with a focus on diversity as a research theme. <br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.<br/><br/>"

It is a global issue that affects a significant number of individuals domestically. To address it, humanitarian organizations involved in hunger relief work collaboratively with the government and private sector. Humanitarian organizations rely on uncertain sources of supply, respond to uneven and variable needs, and make careful decisions regarding how to use scarce resources. These organizations generate data on a massive scale about food supply, food distribution, and food need, which helps them to perform their function. Challenges arise from not only the uncertainty of supply and demand but also from variations in information collected by different organizations. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University will develop an innovative, interdisciplinary training model in data science designed to grow the workforce that will help these organizations analyze their efforts and improve the provision of food aid at the local, state, and federal level. This traineeship seeks to provide a unique and comprehensive training experience for a total of 50 masters and doctoral students, including forty-five (45) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in industrial and systems engineering, computer science, mathematics, agricultural economics, sociology, and public policy.<br/><br/>At present, no formal training mechanism exists by which students can acquire the interdisciplinary knowledge needed to derive insight from heterogeneous big data generated by the food aid supply chain because (a) traditional STEM student training in this area does not include the public policy perspective and (b) working with big data is limited to a subset of the STEM population. To answer this need, this project's research and education efforts will use existing data from the domestic humanitarian hunger relief supply chain as the basis for an innovative, evidence-based, scalable approach to training its future workforce. Our program will provide a model for preparing the next generation of data scientists employed in the humanitarian sector. The overarching goal is two-fold: (i) to create a sustainable training model that improves the preparation of students in STEM fields to pursue careers in data science and (ii) to provide training experiences that will orient students on the use of big data to inform and potentially transform the delivery of services that have societal impact. We propose to leverage big data to reduce uncertainty in this supply chain and drive more effective modes of food distribution by addressing information inequality, visualization, and information-driven decision modeling. The program will feature a summer training institute, industry/academia research clusters, professional development seminars, and ongoing evaluation of the training model. Students who complete all requirements will obtain new knowledge and skills with respect to big data collection, interpretation, and its use in decision-making; obtain new knowledge about using big data to address multidisciplinary problems in hunger relief and food security; and obtain the training necessary to pass an industry-level certification exam. At North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the award will help to establish a new certificate-based interdisciplinary graduate training program in data science. In the larger humanitarian sector, the research generated by this work will improve access to food by reducing information inequality, enhance operational decision-making by providing real-time adaptable visualization of information, and create new information-driven decision models that can positively impact food aid policy and operations.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This traditional approach to graduate education leaves PhD students unprepared to enter the non-academic workforce upon graduation. A lack of adequate preparation not only adversely affects the students themselves, but also leads to missed opportunities for society, since STEM PhD students often have precisely the deep technical background needed to solve the growing number of data-driven problems society faces. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Duke University will test whether Master-level data science programs, which usually have curricula that emphasize the professional skills and applied data skills missing from most PhD programs, can be leveraged to improve the preparation of PhD students. This project will test the outcomes of combining the applied approach of Master-level data science programs with the depth and experience of PhD STEM students. More specifically, it will determine which aspects of Master-level professional curricula translate to PhD students. The results will provide guidance on approaches to extend the impact of a growing investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students and will inform the education community on better preparing the next generation of STEM scientists to work with and improve methods surrounding big data. In so doing, this project will help strengthen the pipeline between universities and non-academic employers. <br/><br/>This project will incorporate a select cohort of Duke's STEM PhD students into Duke's Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) Capstone projects with non-academic partners, and include the selected PhD students in the professional development activities of the MIDS program. Duke's MIDS program emphasizes comprehensive training in professional and communication skills in its coursework. The program culminates in a capstone project that requires students to solve a data-driven problem for a partner outside of the university. Students must apply the technical skills, theoretical knowledge, and professional skills they learned in the classroom to a real-life situation that requires interacting with a diversity of both technical and non-technical collaborators. The goal of this research is to determine which of these enhanced experiences can mitigate - and ultimately, overcome - the shortage of doctoral graduates with industry-relevant training, developed professional competencies, and deep domain knowledge. The principles guiding this IGE project stem from research on the use of vertically-integrated, topically-focused research teams as mechanisms to motivate effective, meaningful learning. The MIDS Capstone curriculum is based on evidence-backed practices from the team-based learning and service learning literature. The effectiveness of the project for STEM PhD students will be evaluated using survey, interview, and structured assessment data collected from students, faculty, and Capstone partners, as well as data from potential future employers and students' supervisors after they move to new positions. Outcomes measured will include students' professional skills, students' data science competencies, students' research accomplishments, and reported benefits to non-academic partners. The results will be used to develop scalable mechanisms for universities to extend the impact of their investment in data science Master programs to doctoral-level students. Doing so will strengthen the potential for PhD students to deploy their expertise to solve society's most pressing problems both inside and outside of academia and will provide richer opportunities for organizations to find data scientists with the specialized knowledge needed to solve problems within their area. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

It is an increasingly energy-intensive enterprise, but it is also a growing source of energy. Agriculture places large demands on water supplies while poor practices can degrade water quality. Each of these interactions creates opportunities for modeling, driven by sensor-based and qualitative data collection, to improve the effectiveness of system operation and control in the short term as well as investments and planning for the long term. The large volume and complexity of the data collected creates challenges for decision support and stakeholder communication. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Iowa State University will build a community of researchers that explores, develops and implements effective data-driven decision-making to efficiently produce food, transform primary energy sources into energy carriers, and enhance water quality.  The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) MS and PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded PhD trainees, from agricultural and biosystems engineering, agronomy, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering and natural resources ecology and management. The project aims to prepare trainees for multiple career paths such as research scientists, bioeconomy entrepreneurs, agribusiness leaders, policy makers, agriculture analytics specialists, or professors. <br/><br/>Sustainable provision of food, energy and clean water requires understanding the interdependencies among systems as well as the motivations and incentives of farmers and rural policy makers. Effective innovation at the nexus of these food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires data-rich system modeling with analytic capabilities for diverse types of data. The traineeship has four key components. First, trainees will complete a new graduate certificate to build competencies in fundamental understanding of interactions among food production, water quality and bioenergy; data acquisition, visualization, and analytics; complex systems modeling for decision support; and the economics, policy and sociology of the FEW nexus.  Second, they will conduct interdisciplinary research on (a) technologies and practices to increase agriculture's contributions to energy supply while reducing its negative impacts on water quality and human health; (b) data science to increase crop productivity within the constraints of sustainable intensification; or (c) decision sciences to manage tradeoffs and promote best practices among diverse stakeholders. Third, they will participate in a new graduate learning community consisting of a two-year series of workshops that focus in alternate years on the context of the Midwest agricultural FEW nexus and professional development.  Fourth, they will have small-group experiences to promote collaboration and peer review. Each trainee will create and curate a portfolio that combines artifacts from coursework and research with reflections on the broader impacts of their work. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Graduate training, however, typically occurs in one of two dimensions: experimental and observational methods in a specific area such as biology and sociology, or in general methodologies such as machine learning and data science.  With more and more students seeking to gain sufficient expertise in mathematical and computational methods on top of domain-specific laboratory and social analysis methodologies, a greater demand for more efficient training is emerging. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Indiana University will address this growing need with an integrated dual PhD program that trains students to be ""bidisciplinary"" in Complex Networks and Systems (CNS) and another discipline of their choosing from the natural and social sciences. It will seamlessly integrate traditional education with interdisciplinary hands-on research in a culture of academic and human diversity. This program will provide unique interdisciplinary training for thirty-four (34) PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded trainees. The program will provide additional training experience to 40 summer affiliate students and a population of more than 300 participants across the participating PhD programs.<br/><br/>The training program capitalizes on the new Indiana University Network Science Institute (IUNI). The Institute's 165+ faculty members will serve in interdisciplinary PhD program committees to be co-chaired by research mentors from both CNS and the target empirical domain. Project-driven, team-based research at IUNI will seamlessly integrate academic education with interdisciplinary hands-on scientific and industrial research. Trainees will learn to connect the general-purpose, computational expertise of CNS to the deep, domain-specific research methodologies of the natural, behavioral, and social sciences thus bridging the gap between distinct training cultures. They will be a new breed of STEM scientists that escapes the silos of disciplinary training to address the complex problems of the 21st century. Specifically, the four goals of training activity are: 1) provide dual research proficiency; 2) develop collaborative skills via early integration into problem-driven, interdisciplinary research; 3) produce a diverse workforce by recruiting student cohorts from a broad set of disciplines and varied backgrounds to be trained within a team culture; 4) establish a sustainable interdisciplinary training model by enlarging the institutional channels created between informatics and natural and social sciences to other Indiana University departments and institutions. A science-of-science study conducted throughout the NRT project will evaluate the efficacy of interdisciplinary training of the students in this program. This project will develop a flexible dual PhD program and best-practices to allow additional departments at Indiana University to join the program in the future, as well as other institutions to develop similar programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Using modern sensors and data analysis techniques, it is now feasible to develop methods to predict plant growth and productivity based on information about their genome and environment.  However, doing so requires expertise in plant sciences as well as computational sciences and engineering. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Iowa State University will bring together students with diverse backgrounds, including plant sciences, statistics, and engineering, and provide them with data-enabled science and engineering training. The collaborative spirit required for students to thrive in this unique intellectual environment will be strengthened through the establishment of a community of practice to support collective learning.  This traineeship anticipates preparing forty-eight (48) master's and doctoral students, including twenty-eight (28) funded doctoral students, with the understanding and tools to design and construct crops with desired traits that can thrive in a changing environment.  <br/><br/>Understanding how particular genetic traits result in given plant characteristics under specific environmental conditions is a core goal of modern biology that will facilitate the efficient development of crops with commercially useful characteristics. Plant characteristics are influenced by genetics and a wide range of environmental factors, including, for example, rainfall, temperature and soil types. Developing methods to effectively integrate these diverse inputs that take advantage of existing biological, statistical, and engineering knowledge will be a key area in this research and training program that will bring together faculty from eight departments. Trainees will engage in cutting-edge research and development areas involving direct data collection and analysis from living plants, including sensor development, high throughput robotic technology, and biological feature extraction through image analysis. This traineeship will use the T-training model to provide students with training across a broad range of disciplines while developing a deep technical expertise in one area. This expertise, in combination with soft skills development, will enable the trainees to work across organizational and cultural boundaries as well as scientific disciplines. To develop understanding of how to share knowledge with diverse groups, the program will provide students with training beyond traditional coursework and research through activities that will develop advanced communication and entrepreneurship skills. Additionally, internship opportunities in industry, national labs, and other settings will equip trainees to choose among the diverse career paths available to scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has challenged the scientific community to expand the uses of this Earth observation infrastructure to generate new knowledge and provide additional societal benefits beyond those that were initially envisioned. This National Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Oklahoma addresses this challenge by developing and testing a new model for training master's and doctoral students to use existing Earth observation data in new approaches to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. The traineeship program will implement and evaluate an interdisciplinary coursework program in Earth-observation for Science, Society, and Sustainability (EOS3) and an interdisciplinary research immersion program. This traineeship anticipates preparing one hundred and twenty (120) graduate students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, across three universities in the emerging discipline of aeroecology. <br/><br/>Aeroecology focuses on understanding the interactions of animals in the aerosphere (lower atmosphere). Aeroecology is emerging from the interface of biology, meteorology, geography, and computer science and has strong connections to social sciences both through environmental science and concerns about human health and safety. Engineering advances are transforming the aerosphere from a vast open space into a resource that we use for communication (cell phone towers), energy production (wind turbines), and transportation (aircraft and unmanned aerial systems). These mounting incursions into the aerosphere drive a need to understand and manage a new suite of human-biodiversity interactions and conflicts. This NRT project will build on unique strengths of the training consortium in aeroecology as a rapidly growing new use of Earth-observation data. The NRT will originate at the University of Oklahoma, replicate first at the University of Delaware, then at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and later radiate to additional consortium institutions across the nation. This NRT model will include training in communication, data analytics, team-based science skills, and entrepreneurship. Externship opportunities with private, government, and non-profit organizations will also help trainees gain professional skills in local, national, and international settings. Each participating institution will foster diversity through the implementation of best practices for inclusiveness in recruiting, retaining, and mentoring of graduate students.

Building upon work that he and his collaborators conducted on the effectiveness of diversity programs at corporations in the United States, they develop several new survey instruments to conduct a research evaluation of diversity programming at universities in the United States.  In particular, they will assess the impact of policies and programs to promote diversity and equity on individual faculty members as well as on the institutions themselves.  These kinds of programs include mentoring activities, networking, professional development activities, career life balances policies and other policy changes. They further compare equity outcomes for individuals and at the institutional level at institutions that have received funding from the National Science Foundation to promote gender equity, awards from the ADVANCE program.  They will use data from the National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System as well as collect new data from the institutions themselves.  Using these databases, the PI and his team will conduct a quantitative study to assess the effects of equity reforms, the persistence of equity reforms, and the diffusion of such reforms across types of institutions.  Findings from this research has the potential to dramatically change the ways that universities in the United States address issues of gender equity because the study should result in identifying policies and programs that are most effective at achieving equity.<br/><br/>The PI team will use a multi-level modeling methodology incorporating the data that they collect through the new surveys with the big data sets already available to them to fulfill the goals discussed above.  In their research on corporate equity programs the Principal Investigators developed an evidence-based theory of the remediation of inequality built on four insights from sociology and social psychology.  They will test those theoretical premises in the academic context.  They incorporate insights from the work-autonomy and self-determination literatures, the labeling and self-determination theories, feminist theory, and accountability theory to build the models to test theories on how equity may be achieved in university settings.  Testing these theories will advance research on gender inequality in academia and at work more generally.  This will be the first study to utilize comprehensive longitudinal data from ADVANCE and peer institutions to evaluate the impact of diversity and equity programming."

The overarching objective of the project is to help develop widely-shared standards for the kind of career outcomes that should be measured; the methods for collecting the data; and the ways in which data should be analyzed and findings disseminated to prospective students, faculty, and administrators. Funding will be used to support four main activities: a web-based national survey of graduate deans in fall 2018, a focus group of graduate deans in December 2018, a one-and-a-half-day conference in May or June 2019, and a multi-pronged dissemination of results of the project. A proposed survey of graduate schools will be the first systematic effort to collect data nationwide and across classes of institutions and graduate programs on the various approaches being implemented to consider how they are working. The project has potential to influence knowledge that could be available to students and university doctoral program leaders about career paths followed by recent cohorts of doctoral recipients to enable graduate students to make wiser career choices. <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will bring together representatives from higher education institutions who have been developing different approaches to studying career pathways of PhD recipients in the STEM fields as well as social science experts in data collection and utilization. The conference will enable participants to exchange lessons learned to date on challenges and accomplishments in tracking STEM careers, develop strategies for mitigating the challenges, and generate an empirically based understanding of issues surrounding career pathway data collection and utilization. The project team will employ a two-step process in collecting quantitative and qualitative data from approximately 270 institutions that currently engage in a career pathways project, have provided information on PhD graduate career outcomes in a public form, or have not engaged this topic. Prior to the conference, they will conduct an online survey to better understand the barriers to beginning a career pathway data collection process and hold focus groups to present the survey findings.  The project will culminate with the conference and dissemination of a monograph that will provide insight and guidance for universities on career pathways data collection and utilization. <br/><br/>This project is funded by he EHR Core Research Program (NSF 15-509) under the STEM Professional Workforce Development core theme.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In implementing the NGSS, teachers are faced with performance expectations that integrate cross-cutting concepts, practices and disciplinary core ideas in ways that depart from more traditional content-focused goals. The practices entail a range of science literacies including question generation, data representation, explanatory modeling, and communication among scientists and with the general public. To be successful, teachers must align these multi-dimensional student performance expectations with instruction that supports these and assessments that demonstrate students' progress. This project engages high school science teachers to develop assessments that cover the multiple dimensions of the performance expectations. Developing these assessments occurs as teachers focus on the nature of the evidence in student work that would indicate progress toward proficiency. Teachers work in learning communities so they can draw on each others' content and pedagogical expertise as they iteratively refine their assessment designs. <br/> <br/>The project builds upon hypothetical learning trajectories for teachers, comprising five dimensions of teacher knowledge and practice: Assessment literacy and practices; views of student roles in assessment practices; participation within collaborative design teams; assessment design practices aligned with NGSS; and NGSS-aligned instructional practices. These dimensions organize a three-year professional development sequence for teachers from six different urban public high schools of a large and diverse school district. The location of this work also enables consideration of how teachers progressively address factors such as language learning, student economic backgrounds, and the needs of special education students. Throughout the sequence, teachers work within professional learning communities focused on iterative cycles of assessment design, implementation, reflection, and revision. The project applies mixed-methods to a variety of data sources, including teacher surveys, documentation of assessment design cycles, student work products, and observations of instructional practices. Analyses aim to further develop the hypothetical learning trajectories, obtain additional insights into teacher collaborative practices, and examine the relationship between changes in teacher assessment practices, their instructional methods, and student learning. Furthermore, engaging teachers in not only the collaborative design of assessments but also in the co-design of the professional development sequence reinforces this project's capacity to afford and foster local innovations that mitigate or resolve tensions extant in science education. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field."

These data could represent, for example: DNA sequences, images of the brain, or number of species in an ecosystem. In each case, unlocking the information within these big data sets requires sophisticated mathematical and computational approaches. The standard curriculum for graduate students in biological sciences was designed well before this data deluge. As a consequence, today's graduate students are not being adequately trained for their future careers. At the same time, there are growing concerns that scientists are sometimes unable to reproduce published findings. This inability often results from poor data analysis strategies. The future success of the US biological research mission hinges on training students to use data analysis approaches that are both rigorous and reproducible. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Chicago seeks to meet this need by developing a new and effective approach to the training of early stage graduate students in the quantitative analysis of biological data.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this program is to teach students to critically evaluate quantitative analysis methods in the scientific literature, and to acquire good programming habits that support reproducibility and rigor in their own research. An interdisciplinary team of quantitative biologists will direct and lead the program, exposing students to the faculty that can advise them in future work. The training program begins with an intensive residential week-long boot camp that brings together students across diverse sub-fields of biology to promote teamwork and prepare them for interdisciplinary research. The boot camp includes introductory tutorials in computer programming, statistics, and modeling in modern biology, as well as more advanced tutorials in statistical approaches to large data sets and practical lessons in organizing and sharing code and data. The boot camp is capped off with a series of workshops in which students apply what they have learned to real biological data spanning a wide range of fields. A subsequent on-campus course builds on and reviews these concepts, and integrates training in rigor and reproducibility with concepts of responsible research. We hypothesize that this program will produce trainees who are well-prepared for the future scientific workforce. We will evaluate the impact of this intervention through quizzes, surveys, and targeted interviews.

The project will undertake a systematic, integrated approach that provides team-based interdisciplinary research and student support and mentoring. Another central element of this approach is career preparation for research positions in industry and national laboratories, as well as academia. Project evaluation will examine implementation, student achievement, and retention and will use formative assessment to guide refinements. If successful, this pilot project will result in an educational approach that improves doctoral completion rates for underrepresented groups and improves career preparedness, and that is scalable and replicable to additional programs and institutions.<br/><br/>The primary goals of the pilot program are to foster computational and data analytic skills within an interdisciplinary framework; reduce attrition, especially among underrepresented minorities and first generation graduate students; and prepare students for careers in, or in partnership with, national laboratories and industry. Program activities in support of the goals include a two-day introductory workshop followed by weekly project meetings and instructional modules focused on specific skills required to solve interdisciplinary computational science problems. Module content will include programming languages, tools for data analytics, model building, fundamental algorithms, and data interpretation and visualization. In addition, the program will provide professional development modules focused on project management, teamwork, communication and presentation skills.  All of the modules will be complemented with continuous mentoring from faculty, peers, and partners from industry and the national laboratories. This pilot project offers students the opportunity to move away from narrow disciplinary training, broadening their approaches to problem solving and their ability to work in diverse teams while also expanding their computational skills and familiarity with data analytic tools. Assessment will evaluate the success of instructional modules and the structure and pedagogical strategy of the project as a whole, with formative assessments informing revisions in an iterative process. It is expected that the interdisciplinary team-based approach employed in this project, in combination with professional development, social supports and multiple mentors, will result in improved completion rates for underrepresented minority and first generation STEM graduate students and prepare them for future career success, thus helping to meet a serious national need.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

These ecosystems, however, are threatened by extreme weather events, changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, and species loss. The expertise to understand the impacts of such threats will require teams who collectively bring to bear modern methods in ecology, data and information processing, computing, statistics, and mathematical modeling. However, such team-based, scientific approaches are rare in formal graduate education programs. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Northern Arizona University will address these challenges by developing a team-based graduate training program in ecological and environmental informatics, with a focus on team-based research combined with the development of strong expert and public communication skills and modern collaborative skills broadly applicable beyond academia. The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) PhD students, including twenty-four (24) funded trainees, with an additional 100 graduate students (MS and PhD) benefiting from various aspects of the NRT training program.<br/><br/>This NRT training program is couched in the interdisciplinary research theme of understanding and forecasting the properties and processes of terrestrial ecosystems, especially the impact of and feedbacks to global change. The field is being flooded with data (e.g., from various ecological and Earth observatory networks) that are critical to understanding and forecasting terrestrial ecosystem responses. However, most graduate students and scientists lack the quantitative, computational, and collaborative skills to leverage such data to address grand, challenging questions. This NRT program will train the next generation of scientists to overcome these limitations, with a focus on training in informatics tools and team-science skills that facilitate solutions to complex problems, motivated by the question: How does anthropogenic global change affect the health and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems? In this innovative graduate training program, trainees will create their own scientist profile in ecological and environmental informatics by building substantive depth in a primary core competency and establishing breadth in other primary and supporting areas. The primary areas include data analytics and computing, analysis and synthesis, and terrestrial ecosystem science; the supporting areas include relevant data collection tools and products as well as skillsets in communication, collaboration, and team building. Key elements of this NRT program are scalable and sustainable, including: (1) a curriculum that allows students to personalize their training, (2) workshops, courses, and other activities that focus on team skills and applying these skills to collaborative research projects, (3) preparation for a range of careers via professional development and applied internship opportunities, and (4) the graduate ecological and environmental informatics certificate that is accessible to students in a range of STEM fields. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-established apprenticeship model for training graduate students, whereby a doctoral student learns from one master advisor, assumes that most graduating Ph.D. students will become faculty members within a university or conduct industry research to address foundational questions in the sciences. Today most Ph.D. chemists do not seek academic appointments and much less basic research is being conducted in the chemical industry. In addition, the knowledge and skill base doctoral students are expected to master continues to expand, while market-like behaviors undertaken by faculty to secure grants, contracts, and patents may create doctoral training contexts in which doctoral research skill development is uneven or unnecessarily extended. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track to the University of Oklahoma will pilot an innovative graduate curriculum in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry that emphasizes customization of individual student programs and careful monitoring of progress. Learning outcomes and evaluation data will be used to determine if this transformative curriculum effectively promotes efficient individual doctoral training while decreasing the time to degree. This curriculum is anticipated to provide a template for revision and reinvigoration of doctoral programs in the chemical sciences nationwide.  <br/><br/>While the components of this innovative curriculum model are based on recommendations from landmark national studies concerning STEM graduate education, this pilot will test these components within a comprehensive curricular revision project. The curriculum model will employ competency-based assessment, accelerated learning, and concrete milestones to meet the goals of broadening participation in the chemistry Ph.D. program while decreasing the time to degree. Through greater oversight, customized curricula, and the use of student-led Individual Development Plans, the number of graduates per year is expected to increase as a result of minimizing attrition and decreasing the time to degree. Greater emphasis will be placed on professional development and skill sets that reach beyond the traditional, narrow definition of chemistry so graduates will be better positioned to contribute to an increasingly diverse workforce. The effectiveness of the new curriculum will be evaluated by comparison with historical data at the University of Oklahoma and current practices and data from a number of peer institutions. The project will document ""real time"" student and faculty experiences and detail emergent challenges as the curriculum is enacted, thereby delineating how the curriculum model may be best replicated across doctoral programs and serve as a resource for other universities nationwide. Project dissemination will include the development of a web-based toolbox of resources to facilitate widespread adoption of successful components. Networked Improvement Communities of faculty and administrators from peer institutions will be used to promote cultural change, invigorate the national debate, maintain reform momentum, and to navigate institutional barriers. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

To ensure we live in a just and vibrant society, it is vital that scientists are able to share their research findings with scientists in other fields, non-science experts, and the public.  Using knowledge from the performing arts, this project will implement a novel pilot training program to teach oral communication to STEM graduate students, facilitating a deeper understanding of communication and providing practice in public speaking, improvisational techniques, and reading body language. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track to Montana State University-Bozeman will modernize STEM graduate education by pinpointing aspects of oral communication training that positively impact students' abilities to communicate orally to a wide variety of audiences, and increase the public's understanding of and engagement with science. Three recruited cohorts of eight STEM graduate students will practice and refine their oral communication skills by creating podcasts and speaking at community events in which they explain their research to the public. The team working on this project includes domain experts in physics, biology, mathematics, and engineering, as well as experts in public speaking, acting, education research, and library sciences. This broad expertise will ensure that disciplinarily diverse STEM students are recruited into the program, providing interdisciplinary perspectives and instruction and facilitating the success of this pilot graduate training program. <br/><br/>This research will investigate whether targeted intervention in oral communication skills for STEM graduate students improves their ability to effectively convey their research to a broad audience. The project will use formative, summative, and longitudinal assessments to determine how various portions of the intervention are successful in developing students' oral communication skills in the following realms: avoiding the use of jargon, public speaking skills, and non-verbal delivery skills. Assessment data for year-long longitudinal studies of each cohort will include survey data related to three areas of oral communication, self-reports from students, and interviews with students and their mentors. To assess competencies such as reducing jargon for communicating with the public, this project will create, modify and use rubrics for effective public speaking. Pre- and post-intervention data will be compared among students and cohorts to determine the effects of each aspect of the training. Results and successes will be shared nationwide with other STEM experts at domain-specific conferences as well as at American Association for the Advancement of Sciences National Conferences. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

The analysis will be conducted in two overlapping stages. First, multivariate modeling using administrative data on registered apprenticeship will examine the prevalence of the apprenticeship training model in STEM occupations and the characteristics of apprentices in these fields. The administrative data also track apprentice outcomes, including progress through and completion of the program and wage rates for completers. These data will be used for multivariate modeling of the determinants of apprentice outcomes. The findings from the multivariate models of apprentice outcomes will inform the development of protocols for the second stage of the analysis - content analysis of apprenticeship work process schedules and interviews with representatives of STEM apprenticeship programs.

The project will utilize publicly available social media data and evaluations provided by undergraduate students to assess the participating graduate students' effectiveness as communicators. These data will permit comparisons of students before and after training and comparisons of traditional assessment methods with those provided through social media analytics. Social media metrics may also provide a cost- and labor-effective means to track trainees over the course of their careers.  The assessment tools developed and tested in this project will be transferable across disciplines and universities, for the first time permitting cost-benefit comparisons among programs using different training strategies. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

The goals are to: (1) Investigate the problem solving steps of beginning and advanced biology students in the domains of protein structure and function and metabolism; (2) Determine the extent to which the use of particular problem-solving steps by biology students predicts their success and persistence in science; and (3) Apply the findings to enhance problem solving skills.<br/><br/>Longitudinal data are being collected from a cohort of biology undergraduates across their undergraduate careers. Data include students' problem solving steps along with demographic characteristics, academic characteristics, and career intentions. Problem-solving steps are analyzed qualitatively. Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling and Hierarchical Linear Modeling are used to determine the extent to which problem-solving skill predicts success and persistence in science. This project expands an online problem solving tutorial to enhance supportive problem solving skills in solving protein structure and function and metabolism problems. Additionally, biology faculty from the university and local high schools are meeting regularly to engage in discussion, implementation, and feedback about how to teach problem solving in biology.<br/><br/>Research in this area is important for greater understanding of how students solve problems which can help educators develop targeted course interventions. Targeted course interventions have been shown to facilitate student success and persistence in science. More widespread success and persistence in science degree programs is necessary to meet the predicted demand for more workers in areas such as health care, biomedical research, and engineering in the United States of America. This project provides insights for building learning and teaching tools to increase the number of undergraduates who are prepared for science career paths. In so doing, the project will contribute to a globally competitive workforce in science in the United States of America. Additionally, the proposed project will increase our understanding of some of the factors that may have impact on the full participation of groups underrepresented in science-related professions."

Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. This project will integrate research on STEM learning in developmental cognitive science and science education to investigate how cognitive aspects of informal biology facilitate or impede the attainment of formal biological concepts. The study will focus on misconceptions common among biology students that may stem not from the complexity of the concepts themselves, but from deeply held informal ways of understanding the scientific world. It will also test hypotheses about the role of language used by college faculty in reinforcing such ways of knowing, and investigate changes in informal biological thought with the acquisition of formal biological knowledge. The project will target college students and faculty members at multiple levels. The study sample will include 100 entering biology majors and non-majors, 100 graduating biology majors and non-majors, 40 faculty members and a comparable sample of non-science faculty members at Northeastern University and San Francisco State University.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary project will bring together cognitive scientists and science education researchers to study four specific aims to: (1) examine the use of cognitive construals in formal biological explanations; (2) investigate the nature of instructional language used in university biology; (3) experimentally manipulate the use of cognitive construals in instructional language; and (2) examine changes on traditional cognitive science measures of informal construal based biological reasoning. Data will be collected from study participants at various points of the study through audio recordings of classroom teaching sessions, pre/post surveys, challenge statement assessments, concept inventories, and laboratory experiments. Results emerging from analysis of data from these sources will advance knowledge at the intersection of cognitive psychology and disciplined-based science education research. If findings from this work clarify there is a relationship between informal biological thought and formal biological science learning, it will help establish a new theoretical framework for understanding the acquisition of knowledge in the life sciences. As such, the research will have direct implications for life science teaching at the undergraduate level and fundamentally change the way instructors teach biological concepts that are particularly difficult for students to learn."

This study of the critical choice points in the career trajectories of undergraduate and master's students in science and engineering will provide insight to researchers and educators about key factors that bring students into STEM pathways and some to leave STEM.  Researchers will use nationally-representative survey data, longitudinal administrative data from major research universities and interviews in universities and firms to focus on the role of high impact events (e.g., research and work experiences, advising, particular courses) on career decisions as well as demand side factors that affect science and engineering career entry and persistence. Fieldwork in firms and colleges will examine how firms are structuring bioscience and engineering jobs and careers and how that affects students' career choices and initial career trajectories.

Three major research analyses will inform STEM education and workforce investments by examining in depth: (1) key decision points and high-impact events that influence student pathways through S&E majors and careers, (2) the impact of undergraduate research employment on college completion and entry into S&E careers, and (3) how the structure of work in S&E firms influences career choices and persistence. The research builds on the normative theories in career counseling (e.g., of interest matching) and labor market studies that focus on the marginal responses to changes in wage rates and employment opportunities; this empirical analysis will advance current knowledge to comprehensively examine multiple factors and contingent decision points. By triangulating across qualitative and quantitative approaches and using detailed longitudinal data, the study will also examine differential impacts and outcomes by demographic group, major, and career field, to provide a full assessment of student trajectories and high-impact events.

Given the increased role of state policies that is expected under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA; signed December 2015), interstate differences in curriculum and testing policies and their effects on outcomes for underrepresented minorities (URM) will provide critical insight into the effectiveness of varying state-level policy initiatives. The proposed study will locate specific spaces and mechanisms wherein existing inequalities for URM can be ameliorated. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. <br/><br/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the interacting effects of: (1) state policy (math and science course requirements for high school graduation, and presence or absence of high stakes testing); and (2) high school opportunity structures (empirically verified math and science course availability, content, sequences and school level requirements). The proposed study is a multilevel analysis of nationally representative longitudinal data (HSLS:09). Using a multi-level regression, the study will look for relationships among high school opportunity structures and student outcomes including student learning, intentions to major in STEM disciplines, and longer term outcomes."

Scholars from each are trained to produce knowledge from a discipline-specific perspective, and seldom have the opportunity, as students, to engage in cross-disciplinary inquiry. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Temple University brings together scientists from the departments of Geography and Urban Studies (Social Sciences) and Biology (Life Sciences) to pilot a model for cross-disciplinary learning and communication that will use studios as a collaborative learning space and a science museum as a venue for public communication. The project will contribute to wider academic reflection about the production of body-centered knowledge and the role of university partnerships to share this knowledge. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to prepare graduate students in the social and life sciences to communicate with each other and with the public by focusing on one broad commonality - the drive to produce knowledge about the human body. The body is a complex phenomenon that is simultaneously biological and social, and thus represents a strategic thematic focus for interdisciplinary collaboration. The model of interdisciplinary graduate education to be developed and tested will use the design studio approach, which asks students to structure inquiry around an ill-defined problem. Graduate student learning will be organized around two sequential design studios and an interactive exhibit. This series is sequential in that each stage demands a broader audience around which to focus design problems. Students in the first studio will design for intra-classroom communication; while in the second studio, they will design for outside audiences and receive feedback from students in middle school, high school, and undergraduate classrooms. Prototypes developed in the design studios will be transformed into exhibits to be presented to public audiences at the Franklin Institute, a science museum in Philadelphia, PA. Student learning will be tracked and evaluated, as will the impacts of outreach activities on students and families. As such, the project seeks to collect data on the effectiveness of this model for interdisciplinary graduate education and university-museum partnerships that could be more broadly scaled and adapted. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Innovations in Graduate Education Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education."

Nebraska's agricultural system in the Platte River Basin is of economic, social and natural value; but the river basin's ability to resist damage from outside threats (e.g. pollution, pests, draught) and recover rapidly is unknown. This training program at the University of Nebraska will examine resilience of agricultural landscapes through the disciplines of agronomy, natural resources, computer sciences, engineering and public policy. The program anticipates training 25 PhD and 25 MS students, including 23 funded trainees, from natural resources, environmental science, agronomy, entomology, plant sciences, geosciences, biosystems engineering, computer science, and public policy. Trainees will engage with external partners from the agricultural industry, government agencies, and other organizations that have an interest and stake in maintaining productive agricultural systems.  This broad graduate training will help develop a workforce and agricultural industry better capable of managing future demands on food, energy, and water systems. <br/><br/>This NRT program will focus on understanding aspects of resilience in water-stressed and energy-demanding agricultural landscapes and will utilize resilience and panarchy theory, adaptive management, novel sensing technologies and modeling, and policy interventions. Such interdisciplinary training is rare in graduate programs in the United States, but is vital to prepare the next generation of natural resource scientists, producers, managers, engineers, and policymakers so they may respond to the challenges created by increasing demands for diminishing and interconnected resources, and the need to maintain and build resilience in stressed watersheds. This NRT program will serve as the innovative foundation for a permanent interdisciplinary graduate program in the resilience of agro-ecosystems. The program will ensure that students, academic programs, government agencies, and the private sector engage in building and preserving natural and agricultural ecosystems to meet local and global demands for water, clean energy, food, and ecosystem services. Graduate student research will focus on the complex and intertwined ecological, technical, and societal systems involved in managing resources in the 21st century, particularly in complex landscapes managed for agricultural production. Further, the program will help develop innovative tools for data collection, analysis, and synthesis to support management and restoration decisions in agricultural systems. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands.

The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.<br/><br/>This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.

A grand challenge for society is to improve the scientific understanding of natural and human impacts on marine ecosystems to ensure that the oceans continue to provide for generations to come. To overcome this challenge, a segment of our nation's workforce must address an unmet and growing demand for hypothesis-driven research to inform the decisions of federal and state resource management agencies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Davis will train the next generation of marine scientists under a new paradigm that puts the policy focus on the front-end of the research and training enterprise as a means of building more effective links between the science and decisions on sustainable use of living marine resources. The project anticipates training 60 PhD students, including 30 funded trainees, from ecology, conservation biology, economics, geology, physiology, biogeochemistry, and oceanography. <br/><br/>There is growing appreciation that the disconnect between the scientific and policy communities is due to the scientific research questions not aligning with the information that policymakers need to make informed decisions, and to the researchers rarely having the wide-angle lens necessary to understand how their disciplinary research integrates with other science to address policy questions. The basis for the training program's paradigm is a novel causal chain model that extends from a policy goal to the different types of scientific information needed to measure the impacts of management decisions. The practice of working through a causal chain, coupled with fieldtrips to stakeholders, basecamps (week-long workshops with decision-makers and stakeholders organized around marine management issues), internships, short-term visiting scientists, research symposium, data-model integration training, and immersion in marine science and policy will provide trainees with a deeper understanding of how their own STEM research, founded in the primary perspective of a single discipline, fits into a policy process. Trainees will be recruited from a diversity of populations, with special attention to students from natural resource-dependent communities (e.g., tribal nations in Northern California, rural and remote coastal towns). Recruitment, mentoring, and professional development skills are woven throughout all of the elements of the training program, including research partnerships with tribal nations and direct engagement with resource-dependent communities via the fieldtrips and basecamps. Elements of the training program are also open to California State University (CSU) masters students through our novel Scholars Program in partnership with CSU's Council on Ocean Affairs and Technology (COAST) program.

This project has the dual aims of achieving a deeper scientific understanding of learning, and communicating a deeper understanding of the science of learning to scientists and the public. Over several decades, diverse fields including genetics, neuroscience, linguistics, education, and psychology have generated a wealth of knowledge about myriad aspects of how humans learn, but a grand challenge remains: to integrate that knowledge into a unified understanding of learning based on these diverse fields, and on scales ranging from the gene to the neuron, brain, and human behavior. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Connecticut will help prepare the next generation of researchers to meet this challenge. The traineeship, focusing on the science of learning, will train fifty (50) PhD students, including twenty-five (25) funded trainees, from education, genetics, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and speech-language-hearing sciences. By emphasizing a problem-based approach (learning by doing), embracing collaboration across a broad a spectrum of disciplines, and integrating hands-on training in communication and leadership skills that enable effective multidisciplinary project design, management, and scientific discovery, this program will offer trainees unique preparation for a range of careers in academia, industry, and the public sector. <br/><br/>The training program has five major components: an intensive one-year seminar that surveys the science of learning across all participating fields, a hands-on practicum where trainees learn to design and implement multidisciplinary research, faculty-student research interest groups that serve as brainstorming launch pads for new scientific challenges, data stewardship modules, and integrated training in outreach and communication. The seminar provides a cross-disciplinary introduction to the science of learning and the challenge of technical communication, while the practicum emphasizes practical skills crucial in academic and nonacademic careers that graduate education too often lacks: project design and management, budgeting and resource allocation, and external communications. The research interest groups, which will evolve as promising research proposals emerge from the practicum, serve as both focal point for research and organizational structure for the participants. From their first day in the program, students face the challenge of how to clearly and effectively share ideas without assuming prior knowledge or relying on technical jargon, a skill that not only enables excellence in research, but empowers trainees to become ambassadors for their work to society as a whole.

Interdependencies among variables abound, and their relationships can change over time in intricate, nonlinear ways.  Such complexities are common in nature and intelligent systems have evolved in biological organisms to adapt to these interdependencies and nonlinearities.  More recently, engineers have begun to build intelligent systems for applications in health, security, and industry that can similarly adapt.  The scientists who study intelligent adaptive systems in nature, as well as the engineers who build them in the lab, are increasingly in need of conceptual and technical abilities to deal with large, complex systems and datasets.  These abilities provide a common basis for exchanging hypotheses and theories among mathematicians, physicists, biologists, cognitive scientists, computer scientists and engineers; all of whom work on common problems of adaptation, learning, regulation, and prediction. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of California, Merced, will help the next generation of PhD students make interdisciplinary breakthroughs in theories and applications of intelligent adaptive systems. The project anticipates training 100 PhD students, including 50 funded trainees, from doctoral programs in applied mathematics, cognitive and information sciences, electrical engineering and computer science, mechanical engineering, physics, and quantitative and systems biology. <br/><br/>Prior research in cybernetics, connectionism, and complex adaptive systems focused on general principles of intelligent adaptive systems that cut across disciplines and domains. The NRT program will advance the next wave of research in this area, by delving more deeply into principles of learning and adaptation as they manifest across a wider range of biological, human, and technological systems. The training program includes an intensive computational basecamp, custom course modules on intelligent adaptive systems, lab rotations, communication skills development workshops, and industry networking opportunities. Taken together, these NRT activities will enable the trainees to achieve conceptual and technical capabilities for dealing with large, complex datasets. All NRT trainees will have the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship, network with industry mentors, engage in professional development, and engage with the local community to educate, disseminate research, and develop outreach partnerships. The NRT program will transform the capacity for interdisciplinary research and education at UC Merced. At the institutional level, the NRT program will serve as a model for collaborative, interdisciplinary graduate education. An extensive recruitment plan will connect with and enhance resources and programs at other UC campuses and a number of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to increase the diversity of scientists and engineers working on intelligent adaptive systems. Finally, the NRT program will have a direct and transformative economic impact in California's Central Valley, by fostering a culture of innovation and higher education in under-privileged communities. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Undergraduates are often included in research projects as beginning steps to becoming scientists. Research on their experiences points to the formation of good mentoring relationships as a key to positive experiences in these critical first stages in the practice of science. Graduate students, who are often present and actively engaged in supervising undergraduate research projects, have an especially good opportunity to ensure that undergraduates thrive in their research, leading to more undergraduates choosing to continue in science fields. Learning to be good mentors also enhances the career skills of graduate researchers, who go on to be lead scientists in universities and industries. This project will provide new insights into the potential positive effects that providing training for graduate mentors has on undergraduates, on graduate students themselves, and on the national science community.<br/><br/>Building on a successful test-program at UC-Berkeley, this project will pilot and assesses the approach's efficacy in training student mentors from a range of STEM fields and research settings. Participant training will include a semester-long professional development course prior to practicing their new skills while mentoring undergraduate researchers.  Formative evaluation results will be used to refine the training elements and course curricula during two additional iterations of the program.  Data on the effectiveness of the training for graduate students from different disciplines will be used to refine and adapt the training materials for students from different STEM fields and backgrounds. By expanding the test population to include graduate student mentors who do not take the formal mentoring course prior to working with undergraduates, but who use the training materials, the project will assess how the newly developed materials will work for students who are self-guided mentors. This project will produce one of the first systematic investigations of the effects of providing formal training in research mentoring to graduate students, including examining variations among discipline clusters on the effectiveness of different techniques.

Different individuals experience the same events in vastly different ways, owing to their unique histories and psychological dispositions. For someone with social anxieties, the mere thought of leaving the home can induce a feeling of panic. Conversely, an experienced mountaineer may feel quite comfortable balancing on the edge of a cliff. This variation of perspectives is captured by the term subjective experience. Despite its centrality and ubiquity in human cognition, it remains unclear how to model the neural bases of subjective experience. The proposed work will develop new techniques for statistical modeling of individual variation and apply these techniques to a neuroimaging study of the subjective experience of fear. Together, these two lines of research will yield fundamental insights into the neural bases of fear experience. More generally, the developed computational framework will provide a means of comparing different mathematical hypotheses about the relationship between neural activity and individual differences. This will enable investigation of a broad range of phenomena in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. The work has further implications for other fields in which there are individual differences in subject experience, such behavioral medicine and the study of stress in the workplace or STEM education and the study of math or test anxiety. This project is funded by Integrative Strategies for Understanding Neural and Cognitive Systems (NSF-NCS), a multidisciplinary program jointly supported by the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE). <br/><br/>The project will develop a new computational framework for modeling individual variation in neuroimaging data and use this framework to investigate the neural bases of one powerful and societally meaningful subjective experience, namely, of fear. Fear is a particularly useful assay because it involves variation across situational contexts (spiders, heights, and social situations), and dispositions (arachnophobia, acrophobia, and agoraphobia) that combine to create subjective experience. In the proposed neuroimaging study, participants will be scanned while watching videos that induce varying levels of arousal. To characterize individual variation in this neuroimaging data, the investigators will leverage advances in deep probabilistic programming to develop probabilistic variants of factor analysis models. These models infer a low-dimensional feature vector, also known as an embedding, for each participant and stimulus. A simple neural network models the relationship between embeddings and the neural response. This network can be trained in a data-driven manner and can be parameterized in a variety of ways, depending on the experimental design, or the neurocognitive hypotheses that are to be incorporated into the model. This provides the necessary infrastructure to test different neural models of fear. Concretely, the investigators will compare a model in which fear has its own unique circuit (i.e., neural signature or biomarker) to subject- or situation-specific neural architectures. More generally, the developed framework can be adapted to model individual variation in neuroimaging studies in other experimental settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, pathogens, pests, and invasive species often quickly evolve resistance to control measures, while important crops and wild populations have limited or variable capacity to adapt to rapidly changing global conditions.  Important insights into the mechanisms of pathogen/pest resistance and resilience will require collaborative efforts that apply evolutionary principles to big data analyses and visualization. However, few opportunities exist for trainees to develop the unique combination of relevant evolutionary, quantitative, and teamwork skills. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Vermont will meet this demand with an interdisciplinary PhD training program called QUantitative & Evolutionary STEM Training (QUEST). The project anticipates training 36 PhD students as core trainees, 18 of whom will receive NRT-funded stipends, from a range of disciplines including biology, mathematics and statistics, engineering, agricultural sciences, environmental studies, and health sciences. <br/> <br/>The QUEST program is unique in its emphasis on evolutionary training, modeling for prediction, and culturally sensitive teamwork. Major research efforts will focus on three areas: (i) emerging infectious diseases and modeling for prediction, (ii) rapid evolution in response to antibiotics, pesticides, and global change conditions, and (iii) pathogen interactions that affect food security and ecosystem health. A supportive and collaborative training environment will be cultivated by cohort building via a shared, physical space, a set of core courses in which trainees work in teams to solve real-world problems, and a seminar that includes invited speakers and professional development activities. In addition, QUEST trainees will complete an applied internship, selected from government, non-profit, industry, and international partners. Through cultural sensitivity and inclusion training for faculty, staff and trainees, and innovative recruitment efforts, the traineeship aims to increase underrepresented groups in STEM. Project outcomes will be (1) trainees that are experts in the application of deep evolutionary and quantitative knowledge to develop solutions for resilience in environmental and global health systems, (2) trainees that can work creatively and collaboratively to translate their skills to practical solutions in non-academic sectors, and (3) a scalable, transferable graduate training program that increases diversity in STEM fields.  <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Students have primarily been prepared for academic career paths although a significant proportion of STEM graduate students go on to non-academic careers. Therefore, it is vital to focus graduate education efforts on preparing a new type of scholar - one with a strong professional identity and a flexible set of tools - rather than preparing a person for a specific type of career. Although often neglected in traditional graduate education, the development of a student's professional identity is proven to raise retention rates and promote academic success, particularly for underrepresented students. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Boise State University will test an educational model that supports the cultivation of STEM graduate students' professional identities through collaboration with undergraduate education majors and elementary students in STEM learning. The teaching and communication skills that graduate students develop through the project will be transferable to diverse career paths.<br/><br/>GIFT (Graduate Identity Formation through Teaching) focuses on the promotion of graduate student professional identity via the concept of disciplinary stewardship, wherein professionals learn not only the knowledge and skills of their discipline, but also how their discipline connects to and serves society as a whole. Through a one credit hour course, graduate students will develop a deeper understanding of pedagogy, as well as issues related to teaching and learning. The graduate students simultaneously serve as disciplinary experts as they teach elementary teacher candidates specific topics related to the Next Generation Science Standards. The teacher candidates subsequently turn this knowledge into 15-minute mini-lessons for elementary students at a local Title I school. Based on interdisciplinary collaborations with four STEM departments at Boise State, spread over six semesters, it is anticipated that this effort will provide a transferable, low/no-cost model for future interventions that support graduate students more broadly. A comprehensive, longitudinal research plan employing both quantitative and qualitative data will enable analysis of the intervention with respect to: graduate student professional identity development, including variability across student demographics/attributes; graduate faculty advisors' attitudes/outlooks on the purposes of graduate education; and the impact of the academic disciplinary context/setting on the design of the intervention, and hence its scalability and transferability.

Specifically, ten educational modules will be created that cover (1) the background and motivation for destructive and non-destructive reverse engineering, invasive and non-invasive probing, fault injection, and counterfeit detection;  (2) the fundamentals of inspection/attack equipment including optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB), photon emission microscope (PEM), and X-ray microscope (XRM);  and (3) an introduction to the image processing, machine learning, and classification techniques needed to make sense of microscopy data in the context of hardware security.  The components of each module will include one or more lectures, an interactive equipment demonstration, an archetypal data set, and multiple forms of assessment (quiz, lab experiment, and exam). Data sets and demos will be generated based on prior research experiments as well as new experiments using the world class instruments available at University of Florida. By making the educational materials available to the academic community, this project will have a significant impact on education and workforce development in cybersecurity, failure analysis, and electronics testing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researchers argue that increasing diversity in ESS can be addressed through 1) an exploration of how relationship development during mentoring impacts career satisfaction and sense of belonging, 2) an analysis of how different groups respond to mentoring, and 3) a synthesis of research findings into practical suggestions that can be disseminated broadly. The rationale for the study is that ESS lags other STEM disciplines in the recruitment, retention, and advancement of skilled workers, resulting in a persistent workforce shortage. The researchers will reconsider the ESS workforce shortage problem by analyzing the role of social capital in career development and sense of belonging in ESS. They will focus on mentoring relationships as a fundamental aspect of the training and education that students need to become professionals, particularly relationship strength and trust built during mentoring and their impact on career development and acculturation on underrepresented groups. The project will contribute to the dialog about the importance of social capital to career development and success.  <br/><br/>Using social capital as the theoretical framework for the study, the researchers will use a mixed methods explanatory design to investigate two questions: (1) How do social capital variables ? strength and trust ? impact career satisfaction and sense of belonging for students undergoing career development and professionals in ESS, and how do the impacts differ across diverse groups? and (2) What are the benefits and costs to ESS mentors, and do the impacts differ across diverse groups of mentors?  The research is expected to yield insights concerning the nature of social capital development during mentoring, how diverse groups are impacted differently through mentoring or being mentored, and how research can be distilled into practical lessons to increase the retention of diverse groups in ESS.   The data will provide concrete evidence for steps mentors can take during mentoring to facilitate the success of diverse protgs and steps mentors and students can take to ensure their own satisfaction with the mentoring experience. These insights will be synthesized into two workshops for ESS students and faculty mentors.  <br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.  ECR supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation."

The clinic procedures, instructional modules and measures will be disseminated to the educational community. This project brings to bear research in learning in conjunction with methods used in other disciplines, particularly the humanities, which have proved successful in augmenting existing courses to provide reinforcement of basic skills. From this grounding, the Secure Programming Clinic seeks to build and assess expertise in an area that spans many aspects of programming. The project further studies how to deliver this information and practice; how to frame the information so students at different levels of programming experience and skill can benefit from them; and how to use the results of the evaluation to tune the clinic and materials."

It includes an education plan focused on transferring the research to improve education.  Because these context-rich, problem-solving experiences more closely mimic professional work, they offer important venues for STEM workforce development. However, these environments tend to be resource and time-intensive compared to lecture courses, so it is important to understand their unique benefits. The level of ""context"" refers to the complexity of the goals, tools, and applications for learning. While there is a substantial amount of education research related to lower-context learning, such as active learning in lecture courses emphasizing knowing, concepts, and the acquisition of knowledge, there has been less education research on high context (""context-rich"") environments. such as laboratories and actual research experiences that involve practice.  The project will support the improvement of context-rich experiences that develop the science and engineering workforce, support retention and diversity, create free and publicly available assessments for STEM faculty, and guide policies on expanding and improving access to research experiences and other context-rich environments.  The project addresses a national need for research that can inform the development, testing, validation, and dissemination of assessments of learning in context-rich environments and guide education policy.<br/><br/>This research will examine how context-rich experiences prepare students for STEM workforce careers.   The research plan involves describing the experience, observing evidence for learning, comparisons of activities, outcomes, and the development of new assessments.  The conceptual framework is based on applying Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) to learning in context-rich settings.  CHAT provides a perspective that situates cognition within an activity system that relates a subject, an objective, and a community as an activity system that accomplishes practical outcomes. Data collection and analysis will utilize Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), particularly to understand mechanisms and factors within context-rich problem-solving environments that support outcomes such as development of professional identity, self-efficacy, and persistence.  The education plan involves a project based first-year physics course, as well as the development of a set of validated tools that could be used for the assessment of learning in context-rich environments.  Thus, the education plan is integrated with the research activities and would provide both local (course-specific) and transferable (disseminated) outcomes.  <br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  ECR supports fundamental research that advances knowledge on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM fields, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, many of the positive changes to instructional practices and metrics for success have not been implemented at the graduate level. With a national economy increasingly dependent on highly-trained specialists in technical fields, this is a nationally-relevant problem. Similarly widespread are the problems of high attrition rates in physics graduate programs (on the order of 50%, nationally) and persistent underrepresentation of women, African Americans, Hispanics and other groups in Physics and STEM. These chronic shortcomings in diversity and in retention highlight the need for improved strategies in STEM education at the graduate level. One of the significant barriers identified is the traditionally-taught graduate core physics courses.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to The Ohio State University will seek to develop, adopt, and assess innovative, research-based instructional best practices in graduate-level physics courses, especially focusing on factors affecting retention and diversity. In particular, the project is aimed at ensuring that the developed methods and materials are widely-applicable and adoptable by engaging multiple sites in the development process (initially four large Midwestern research universities), and collecting data on effectiveness at each site.<br/><br/> A critical strategy of the project is to directly engage the graduate core course instructors of each participating institution. The approach applies and adapts a successful model for establishing and maintaining faculty learning communities to facilitate the professional development of instructors and the adoption of research-based instructional materials and methods. The project will also engage the department graduate studies committees to facilitate positive change in policies and practices in order to ensure systemic and lasting change. In a bottom-up process emerging from the needs of the faculty learning communities, instructional materials will be developed via a highly effective research-based iterative model including the identification of student difficulties and construction of materials to engage students in addressing those difficulties in an inclusive and welcoming environment. The approach includes feedback to the instructors and the project researchers via performance on content tests, course assignments, in-class performance, student surveys (e.g., attitude, belonging, motivation) and student and faculty surveys and interviews. This program will advance our knowledge of topic-specific instructional materials and methods to improve student learning at the graduate level, which is currently virtually non-existent, and can serve as a model for other STEM graduate programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

While many of the skills and competencies needed for both types of research are overlapping or complementary, graduate students may not have the opportunity to fully explore industry-related skillsets and mindsets in a traditional academic setting.  Stronger collaboration between industry and academia can bridge this gap, with most institutional approaches involving a short-term industry internship. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Lehigh University will test a graduate training model that represents a student-centered, holistic approach that gives students long-term, hands-on industry experience.  A key feature of the approach is early and sustained industry engagement, with industry partners involved in identification of the research question that forms for the basis for the student's thesis, mentoring, delivery of professional development modules, and supervision of students during a company residency (similar to medical school training).  This approach is patterned after successful programs in France, Germany and the UK, with the intent of testing the model in the United States.  It is hypothesized that the approach will train graduate students more effectively to engage in use-inspired research and prepare them with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an industrial setting. <br/><br/>The project will pilot and test several key features of this use-inspired research training model: (a) a pre-program summer experience with a company to identify a research topic; (b) co-advisers from the university and partner company; (c) modular, graduate-level professional development co-taught by faculty and industry researchers; and (d) a one to two semester company residency. The effectiveness of these four elements will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with an eye toward critical student skillsets identified through a gap analysis with industry partners.  The study will use both longitudinal data from individual students as well as comparisons to non-participatory control groups.

The study will produce evidence on factors that influence retention, degree attainment, and technical skills development for community college students in ICT fields and inform future research about appropriate theory and measurement tools for use in studies about community college to ICT career pathways.  Research results will inform investments in broadening participation programs, institutional and classroom policies and procedures, and intervention programs designed to increase persistence in ICT programs.  <br/><br/>The research team will test a portion of an expanded and adapted theory of student persistence to investigate how different factors influence community college students? outcomes. The project will investigate three research questions: (1) What baseline factors (individual, relational, and institutional) are most related to the intentions of community college students to complete their ICT courses?  (2) What baseline and interim factors are most related to completion of the ICT course? And (3) What baseline, interim, and current factors are most related to other indicators of success that include program completion, technical skill development, and enhanced workforce capacity?  Data analyses will proceed from descriptive and bivariate analyses to multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses. These will be guided by theory as well as prior research on the role of individual, relational, and institutional factors in career pathways. The study will yield evidence about what leads to retention, degree attainment, and technical skills development for underrepresented community college students in information and communications technologies. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development."

In 2016, there are 135 camps involving approximate 6000 students and 1200 teachers. To help assess and achieve one of the goals of GenCyber, understanding correct and safe on-line behavior, the proposed project aims to develop an innovative tool, the Cybersecurity Judgment Questionnaire (CJQ), for assessing middle and higher school students' understanding of cybersecurity.<br/><br/>CJQ is based on the heuristics and biases theory by Daniel Kahneman and focuses on cybersecurity judgment rather than on cybersecurity behavior or cybersecurity awareness because ordinary people's daily behavior is significantly influenced by their intuitive thinking and thus it is important to get into young cyber users' minds and compare their intuitive and rational cybersecurity thinking. The questionnaire employs the survey experiment approach that integrates the strengths of both surveys and experiments to collect data effectively and efficiently. In addition, to assess authentic cybersecurity judgment, it will use a real-life scenarios and ask young cyber users to judge the risk intuitively and rationally rather than asking participants to answer simple multiple-choice questions.<br/><br/>The project will attempt to verify and extend Daniel Kahneman's theory of heuristics and biases in the cyberspace in general and in the cybersecurity domain in particular. It will use the scenario-based survey experiment with the factorial design to develop, validate, and test the measurement of cybersecurity judgment. The measurement provides a tool to assess cybersecurity understanding of GenCyber student campers. In addition, young cyber users can see both their specific vulnerabilities for possible cyber-attacks and their potential strengths for protecting cybersecurity."

Members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concern about the health and competitiveness of the nation's colleges and universities.  Furthermore, employers often indicate that new university graduates lack creativity and problem solving skills, even when they have advanced degrees in specialized fields. Because creativity and innovation are the driving forces for economic growth, it is critical to infuse innovative thinking and hands-on experience into the engineering and technology graduate curricula. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) will pilot a new cross-disciplinary education model to achieve these ends. This project will promote creativity and innovation by integrating arts and experiential learning components, such as intense studio training, into engineering and technology graduate curricula. <br/><br/>Faculty members in engineering and technology will work with their counterparts in the fine arts to integrate Engineering, Technology, and Arts (ETA) and develop an experimental Design Track in the existing Mechanical Engineering master's program at IUPUI. Students in the proposed ETA Design Track will acquire real-world problem solving skills through short-term programs with industry and national laboratories. This project involves the development of three interdisciplinary courses: (i) Irregular, free-form, and origami inspired structures, (ii) Optimal design of mechatronic systems: toys, robots and interactive structures, and (iii) Environmental pollution and emission control. The courses will be team-developed and taught by faculty from programs in interior design, video art and interactive installations, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering technology. These three courses will constitute the proposed ETA Design Track and support a new Graduate Certificate in Design. Pedagogical approaches will include problem-based, studio-based, and experiential learning. The project will test the ability of ETA curriculum integration, as well as experiential learning in industry or government laboratories, to enhance creativity and innovation among participating graduate students.  Quantitative data will be collected using the Reisman Diagnostic Creativity Assessment and contextualized using student and faculty interview results.   In addition, program outcomes will be tracked.  Expected program outcomes for the ETA Design Track include: increased integrative learning, innovative thinking, patents, high-quality publications, and start-ups by ETA graduates. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the Rochester Institute of Technology and the American Physical Society (APS) will explore interventions that may help increase the access of US women and underrepresented minorities to physics PhD programs and increase the PhD completion rates of these groups. This innovative project will, for the first time, investigate how physics faculty approach admissions and student retention. Evaluation data from this project will allow the design of training materials to help faculty use more inclusive practices.  Because these interventions are likely to be transferrable to different fields and institutions, the project has the potential to revolutionize how STEM graduate admission is carried out and to increase the completion rates of US citizens in STEM PhD programs.<br/><br/>This project will address graduate STEM education inclusion at both the admission and retention phases. To address access, the project will investigate faculty attitudes and admission measures.  Physics faculty attitudes toward diversity, merit, and non-cognitive constructs will be assessed as a measure of change readiness.  Participating faculty will then be trained in holistic admissions, a method that is proven to increase diversity in graduate education. The project will develop and validate a non-cognitive assessment tool as part of the holistic admissions packet.  To address retention, faculty will be trained on evidence-based support structures that can help new graduate students manage the difficult first years of graduate school.  Experimental faculty-centered workshops on admissions and retention will be developed and delivered by the project to four partnering programs at three universities (Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Central Florida, and University of Denver) and then at national meetings hosted by the APS. Formative assessments of these workshops throughout the grant period will be used to revise and refine the materials, resulting in an Admissions and Retention Faculty Training Program that may be used by departments across the country.

Despite the many novel advances in data-driven cybersecurity research, there is no sharing platform that aggregates and provides data and tools used and developed in cybersecurity research for the larger cybersecurity community. The proposed project aims to fill this gap by developing the Cybersecurity Big Data and Analytics Sharing Platform to encourage cybersecurity researchers to share their data, tools, and analytical approaches. In addition, the project will support two Security Big Data and Analytics Sharing Workshops to engage the community in the platform development. Upon project completion, the platform will be open for access by the broad cybersecurity research and education community.<br/><br/>The proposed data sharing platform would enable the publication of high-impact, reproducible, and cutting edge research to advance scientific discoveries. Such a platform would also enhance the educational experience for cybersecurity students, specifically CyberCorps SFS students as they prepare to enter the cybersecurity workforce. The proposed project will provide value to both cybersecurity researchers and students by providing data for cutting-edge research and enhanced educational experiences. In addition, this project will also have significant value to government agencies and other organizations interested in developing cyber threat intelligence knowledge.

Computation on Big Data may require massive computational resources and, while an organization may have the capability to carry-out these analyses, it may use a third-party service to outsource some computations to be cost-effective. In these cases, data may be transferred to a third-party service, giving rise to concerns associated with the trustworthiness of the third-party computational devices and the security of sensitive information. When a third-party server is used for computation, data inherently becomes available in untrusted environments, for example: to a hacker during data transmission, or to adversaries at the third-party location where the computation is performed. Data owners may need to protect their data, and require cryptographic guarantees about data security and integrity of computational output from these third-party services. The proposed project from the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) will address this need by developing an experimental education program for Big Data Security and Privacy (BDSP). The project will develop a set of laboratory exercises and course modules in BDSP that will be shared with academia, government and industry.<br/><br/>Recent advancements in embedded hardware technology to support trusted execution environment (TEE) have generated exciting opportunities for research in the field of cloud computing, trusted data analytics, and applied cryptography. By protecting code and data within a secure region of computation, a cloud service can ensure confidentiality and integrity of data and computations. There is a need to establish a scientific foundation for data analytical models to leverage TEEs, evaluate their limitations, explore performance overhead, and analyze security implications such as side channels. The proposed project will generate a BDSP laboratory for students to carry out experimentation in trustworthy analytics. The results will be incorporated into several of the existing courses in Cyber Security at UT Dallas. In addition, the project will generate a capstone course in BDSP. The goal is to develop a skilled workforce in BDSP to securely analyze the vast amounts of data that are used to provide better services in government, industry and academia. Further, with the established Center for Engaging Women in Cyber Security at The University of Texas at Dallas, this project will encourage, motivate and provide opportunities for female and minority students in cyber security. The project will leverage the Center to recruit highly qualified female and minority students into the education program in BDSP."

In many complex domains involving people, the number of descriptions of a situation and the number of potential decisions that can be made to improve upon the previous situation is enormous. The sheer size of this problem implies that careful selections of additional data must be made to improve decision making. In health, these decisions could involve a course of treatment; in learning these could involve remediations such as additional practice, in personalization it could involve improved choices for consumers. This proposal will develop new algorithms that are especially effective in coming to close to optimal decisions quickly.<br/><br/>This project will aim to develop novel algorithms that specifically address these needs, and thus enable data intensive systems to be efficiently used towards solving the decision making process. Since novel algorithmic methods of this kind are best developed, refined and tested on a real domain, the project will  focus on the educational domain of classroom learning activities that optimize learning outcomes. However, the algorithms will be applicable to numerous other decision making domains. Specifically the project will focus on finding algorithmic solutions for:<br/><br/>(1) Large-scale deployment and data collection of lesson enactments in thousands of classrooms worldwide.<br/>(2) Data-driven methods to efficiently determine the likely most important parameters of the classroom decision making process.<br/>(3) The development of novel reinforcement learning algorithms with a focus on efficient use of data to rapidly converge towards beneficial policies.<br/>(4) Using data to determine the key model and decision parameter space bottlenecks, which, if removed, could significantly<br/>improve the outcomes of the Reinforcement Learning process. The efficacy of the optimized policy will be  determined by the improvement of classroom learning performance at scale.<br/><br/>The methods that will be developed by this project are general enough to be directly applicable to domains of patient treatment, or any other domain that involves unknown model dynamics and decision space that involves people.  The Reinforcement Learning methods will similarly find practical use in situations where a decision policy is deployed in a large number of instances asynchronously and in other high-risk settings where reducing over-exploration as much as possible is of high importance."

The researchers will use social cognitive career theory (SCCT) as a framework and mixed-methods design to investigate research questions regarding (1) differences in student participants and motivation to participate in community college STEM work-based-learning, (2) structures of community college STEM WBL opportunities and their alignment to best practices principles in WBL, and (3) the impact of participating in community college STEM WBL on student outcomes, including certificate or associate's degree completion, persistence in STEM, and broadening participation. The underlying assumption is that WBL might serve as an antidote to negative social and cultural messages, lack of support, lack of access to on-the-job STEM learning, and other factors that influence students' decisions to remain in STEM. The study also will contribute to career counseling research through the application of the SCCT in the community college context. <br/><br/>Researchers will use a mixed-methods research design that involves an analysis of two cohorts (recession and post-recession) using data from the Florida Education Data System (FEDS), case studies at two Florida community colleges, and transcript data for the information technology and engineering technology students enrolled at the case study schools. The study sample is expected to include a total of 8,665 community college students with 1,500 having participated in a WBL course.  Researchers will use exploratory and descriptive multivariate analysis of FEDS to answer questions about WBL participation and impact.  Case studies of WBL will be conducted at two Florida community colleges to collect data about how students learn about WBL, what influences their choice to participate in WBL, how WBL influences their self-efficacy and expectations (per SCCT), and perceptions of whether WBL improves student outcomes. In addition, they will analyze extant data from the colleges to explore the impact of WBL experiences on student completion and entrance into STEM careers and four-year STEM programs of study.  The interview sample for both colleges will include 60 students, six administrators, 24 faculty, and 48 employers. The researchers will use the data to test the best practice principles in WBL developed by Jobs for the Future as bench marks for community colleges.

The PRIME program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on exploring innovative approaches, building on and expanding the theoretical foundations, and growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field. Increasing pressures for accountability have resulted in a push for rigorous evaluation of educational programs and practice. Yet rigorous evaluations such as Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) are expensive and often show small effects. Even RCTs of widely-adopted digital learning platforms can show disappointing results and these results have little impact on subsequent adoptions of programs already entrenched in the educational landscape. New methods are needed to both estimate effects and to indicate ways of improving outcomes for already-adopted digital learning tools. With platforms currently in wide-scale use, novel approaches to assessing use patterns and their relations with outcomes can both evaluate maximal effectiveness and provide means for improved effectiveness. This research will develop an evaluation of ST Math, a K-8 digital learning platform designed to strengthen the mathematical competency of students through enhancing both their understanding of math concepts and their motivation for math learning. By investing in evaluation innovations to improve digital learning platforms such as ST Math, such programs could reach large numbers of children with maximal effectiveness with each iteration. Development of automated tools for improvement can also enhance both the efficiency and efficacy of the digital learning platforms. This work will be accomplished through a partnership between researchers at North Carolina State University (NC State) with expertise in educational evaluation, educational data mining, and assessment with program developers at the non-profit MIND Research Institute (MIND).<br/><br/>This project will explore novel, and noninvasive, approaches for determining the impact of the ST Math digital learning environment. It will advance the analytical basis for formative assessment using process data and build algorithms that improve STEM teaching and learning by facilitating the automatic recognition of teachable moments for learning. The transformative potential of this research resides in the creation of new cross-disciplinary approaches that can be used to not only evaluate impact, but to inform improved teaching and learning in STEM, by leveraging observed behaviors of students and teachers and educational data mining techniques. Specifically, this research will explore novel methods for detecting, visualizing, and evaluating students? puzzle-solving and puzzle-selection behaviors. The PIs will assess whether the detected patterns are driven by students? incoming competence or can be used to predict their short and long-term performance. By linking student and teacher behavior patterns with important learning and motivational outcomes, the researchers may be able to recommend promising actions to teachers and potential refinements to developers. This work has the potential to not only transform the use and success of the ST Math platform, but to create methods that can be refined and transferred to the evaluation and implementation of other platforms."

This dataset is unique in that it will connect detailed information about preservice teacher education experiences - such as transcript and student teaching data - to outcomes for all individuals trained to be teachers within specific teacher education programs in Washington State. The project will merge these data to longitudinal data from Washington State's new P-20 data warehouse and survey data of teacher education faculty and school district administrators to investigate three broad research questions: (1) What aspects of preservice teacher education are predictive of the probability and timing of public teaching workforce entry for prospective STEM teachers?; (2) Where do prospective STEM teachers who never enter the public teaching workforce end up employed, and what are their starting salaries in these positions relative to starting teaching salaries in the state's single salary schedule?; and (3) What preservice experiences and characteristics (including measures of content-area preparation, pedagogical knowledge, clinical experiences, and the alignment or ""match"" between a candidate's teacher education experiences, student teaching experiences, and early-career teaching experiences) are predictive of future STEM teacher effectiveness?  The descriptive analyses use split-population models and value-added models to investigate the first and third research question. For the second research question, the analyses will focus on descriptive statistics that compare outcomes for those teacher candidates who do and do not enter teaching, attending to mediating characteristics such as salaries and pay scales."

The platform will be built based on an existing proof-of-concept prototype called Nugget.  The resulting platform will be tool-agnostic and will support different pedagogical approaches.  The platform will provide the ability to formulate and apply forensic queries over different, and potentially large, data sources in an easy to understand manner.  The project will make it possible for domain experts, such as cybersecurity and law enforcement analysts, to learn and perform forensic investigations.  A set of hands-on materials, that utilize the platform, will be developed to support a two-course sequence in digital forensics and incident response.  <br/><br/>The platform will provide a formal and unifying conceptual framework for all DFIR analytical techniques, and will enable different approaches to DFIR education.  This will allow courses from introductory to research-centric graduate courses, to use the same conceptual framework, and will enable instructors to focus more clearly on concepts rather than specific tools.  The associated runtime environment will allow the separation of the specification of a query from its implementation.  This project will result in a tool that provides the means to incrementally integrate advanced forensic capabilities, such as SaaS forensics, data analytics, and eventually deeper AI techniques into cybersecurity curricula.  The platform will provide the means to acquire and analyze data from popular cloud services, such as cloud drives and online collaboration, and will also integrate with security monitoring/incident response systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and co-PIs at Purdue University will undertake an important research study designed to create a new paradigm for evaluating STEM MOOCs that go beyond analyzing clickstream data and could be used for evidence-based decision making. The goal of this new paradigm is to contextualize evaluation metrics by taking into consideration learner characteristics, course characteristics, and stakeholder goals. It is envisioned that this new paradigm would guide the development of the next generation of STEM MOOCs.<br/><br/>The proposed full-scale, three-year PRIME project will develop and test a contextualized evaluation framework on over 56,000 learners enrolled in 15 advanced STEM (nanotechnology-related) MOOCs offered through the Purdue X and edX partnership, in conjunction with nanoHUB-U and Boeing. The project will result in the creation of data collection instruments and an evaluation method that make sense of diverse forms of learner data for action-oriented decisions to support learning and institutional goals in providing STEM MOOCs. The research study will employ a multiphase mixed methods approach to address the following research questions: (1) What constructs contribute to learners? behavior and performance in advanced STEM MOOCs? (2) What information is needed to inform stakeholders decision-making regarding the value of offering advanced STEM MOOCs? How do stakeholders needs drive the design of MOOCs? (3) What is a context sensitive, generalizable framework of evaluation for advanced STEM MOOCs?  The results from the research study have the potential to make significant theoretical contributions to the evaluation field by developing a novel evaluation framework that would be more effective for determining the value of offering STEM MOOCs and the impact on learning outcomes."

This program trains students in three specific areas: (1) cellular systems neuroengineering, which studies the nervous system?s signaling processes at the molecular and cellular levels; (2) engineering multi-neuron circuits, which involves collecting and analyzing data from groups of brain cells and devising methods to induce them to produce new functional responses; and (3) translational neuroengineering, which develops systematic approaches to improve clinical devices such as prosthetics and deep brain stimulators. Trainees in this program are learning to be technologically innovative; to be aware of social, cultural, and ethical aspects of neuroengineering; to communicate their work effectively to a wide variety of audiences; and to understand the pathways to commercialize their discoveries.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As this program trains neuroengineers to develop advanced solutions to functional and structural problems in the brain, a new problem-based learning curriculum will result and will be shared with the public through open education resources. By cultivating relationships with biomedical device companies, international researchers, and collaborators within two minority-serving institutions in Texas, students in this program are expanding the applications of their training and increasing participation in their research.<br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and leadership  skills needed for the career demands of the future.

It will also examine the experiences of practicing Black secondary mathematics teachers about their beliefs about mathematics content, recruitment, retention, racialized experiences in education, and perceptions and beliefs about current pedagogical practices. This information will be used to inform educational policy and provide implications for recruiting and maintaining a more diverse mathematics education teaching force. <br/><br/>A mixed methods research design will be used to collect data through oral history interviews with retired Black mathematics teachers and focus group sessions with current mathematics teachers. A large-scale survey will also be adapted and administered to capture the experiences of current Black secondary mathematics teachers from a sociocultural perspective. Through these data sources, this research will advance knowledge of the historical and sociocultural influences that impede recruitment and retention of a diverse teaching force by focusing efforts on understanding these issues in relation to Black mathematics teachers. It will also inform research methodology in STEM by integrating untapped, yet appropriate methodologies suitable for challenging issues of recruitment, retention, and praxis of other underrepresented racial and ethnic groups across time periods and school contexts. Further, this project will contribute to theories about the development of mathematics identity and mathematics teaching. This outcome, in turn, will help broaden participation of underrepresented teachers and students in STEM while improving mathematics achievement and performance overall. Through these avenues, findings from this research will reach a variety of academic and general public audiences through online digital portal and website that will provide informational and educational tools for the larger education community."

Information leakage and data breaches have become increasingly damaging to businesses, the government, and people's lives. Correspondingly, hackers have more incentive to attack for financial and political gains. While the existing cybersecurity curricula focus on defensive solutions, this proposed online program from the University of Central Florida attempts to provide both defensive and post-attack digital forensics curriculum for dedicated digital forensics students and professionals. This project will enrich the future cybersecurity workforce with both preventative and post-attack digital forensics skills to effectively counter the cause and effect of cyber-attacks. This program will also help alleviate shortages of qualified digital forensic researchers and practitioners in cybersecurity areas.<br/><br/>Specifically, in this project, the researchers will build an online digital forensics program including two introductory courses and seven hands-on labs. The program will help build the necessary background for students and professionals to perform high pressure, skilled post-attack digital forensics analysis and incident responses. Students and professionals will acquire digital forensics knowledge to tackle future challenges in emerging cyber-systems such as networked critical infrastructures. Meanwhile, as computers and smart devices penetrate every aspect of our life, digital forensics training should not only cover traditional personal computers but also emerging smart devices, including smart phones and Internet of Things (IoT). Upon this request, this program also includes course materials and hands-on labs on forensic analysis of smart phones and IoT devices. The principal outcomes of the project will be enhancing cybersecurity curricula to include digital forensics courses and hands-on lab modules that focus on evaluating and analyzing cyber-attacks and countermeasures at the post-attack stage. Through this project, students and professionals will be prepared with the digital forensics knowledge necessary for them to undertake specific roles in future cybersecurity and digital forensics careers. Further, hands-on labs are emphasized in the project since these can help students solidify their knowledge from coursework and will eventually prepare them for real-world cybersecurity challenges."

(2) How do these variables change over time in both STEM persisters and non-persisters? and (3) How do these variables explain persistence among African American and women STEM majors? The sample will include a stratified, proportionally representative sample of 400 STEM majors. In addition to the primary variables of interest (career-related problem solving, decision-making, goal setting, and managing goal pursuit), STEM career development, professional identity, social class, and developmental complexity will be studied. Collecting data on grade-point average, changes in majors, internships, employment/graduate student interviewing, and progress toward career goals will provide the opportunity for examining the link between the previous variables and more traditional measures of success and persistence. They will use structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling to analyze the relationship between and among the variables and growth curve modeling and profile analysis to provide additional data regarding the longitudinal change in the variables of interest. The research will result in a clearer understanding of the role of problem-solving, goal- setting, and planning skills in the development of a STEM vocational identity and persistence in STEM careers; the role of professional, racial/ethnic, and social class identities on commitment and retention in STEM majors; and the role of cognitive complexity in facilitating STEM career development, commitment, and retention. <br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

While selective ATCPs are intended to address issues of teacher staffing and quality by recruiting high achieving graduates of the nation's most competitive colleges and career changers with impressive resumes, there is little understanding about the reasons for their mixed outcomes. Thus, the proposed project will utilize a multi-methodological longitudinal design that incorporates cultural-mathematical and sociological perspectives to 1) determine patterns of career trajectories of a representative sample of SRMTs and 2) examine how variations in the features of a selective ATCP affect SRMT retention.  The results of the study will be useful to various stakeholders, including policymakers, district and school leaders, and directors of urban-specific teacher preparation programs by clarifying patterns in the career trajectories of SRMTs while also revealing how to retain them..     <br/><br/>The study is framed by the literature on teacher turnover, alternative teacher certification programs, and teachers' professional life cycles. It is guided also by  two theoretical perspectives, namely a sociological careership perspective used to examine SRMTs' career trajectories and a cultural-mathematical perspective that identifies the features of selective ATCPs that influence SMRT retention.  The researchers will combine new survey and interview data with previously collected data on New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) to produce findings that could inform the development of mathematics teacher preparation programs and interventions for an improved urban mathematics teaching force.     <br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

The core strategy for measuring change from the intervention will come from the race-focused, academic career-centric mentoring program that will be co-developed using a nationally recognized online mentoring model and information from the proposer?s own online web portal. This mentoring program will test how effectively the model reduces the impact of racial/ethnic microaggressions for Black, Latino/a, and Native American doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers. Outcomes will be multidimensional. First, data will provide a foundation for understanding how to improve the experiences of underrepresented groups in environments that marginalize students of color. Second, the video documentary will serve as a training tool for STEM administrators and leaders. Third, the video documentary will provide research-based coping strategies to help members of the underrepresented population minimize the impact of racialized experiences and negative outcomes while promoting a balanced perspective on both the doctoral completion process and faculty life in engineering and computing.

While selective ATCPs are intended to address issues of teacher staffing and quality by recruiting high achieving graduates of the nation's most competitive colleges and career changers with impressive resumes, there is little understanding about the reasons for their mixed outcomes. Thus, the proposed project will utilize a multi-methodological longitudinal design that incorporates cultural-mathematical and sociological perspectives to 1) determine patterns of career trajectories of a representative sample of SRMTs and 2) examine how variations in the features of a selective ATCP affect SRMT retention.  The results of the study will be useful to various stakeholders, including policymakers, district and school leaders, and directors of urban-specific teacher preparation programs by clarifying patterns in the career trajectories of SRMTs while also revealing how to retain them..     <br/><br/>The study is framed by the literature on teacher turnover, alternative teacher certification programs, and teachers' professional life cycles. It is guided also by  two theoretical perspectives, namely a sociological careership perspective used to examine SRMTs' career trajectories and a cultural-mathematical perspective that identifies the features of selective ATCPs that influence SMRT retention.  The researchers will combine new survey and interview data with previously collected data on New York City Teaching Fellows (NYCTF) to produce findings that could inform the development of mathematics teacher preparation programs and interventions for an improved urban mathematics teaching force.     <br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

The model reconciles the inconsistent literature on team diversity and team performance and addresses the fundamental question of when and how team diversity can have a positive relationship with various indicators of performance such as creativity, innovation, team effectiveness, and performance. The study adds to the research literature by explicitly linking types of team diversity with innovation; simultaneously examining team dynamics, team microclimate, and team cognition to highlight factors that facilitate or impede innovation in diverse teams; adding temporal elements by collecting data over a two-year period; and examining the diversity-innovation process among teams of working engineers in the field. Investigators will use variables such as the value, radicalness, and number of a development team?s patents in emergent technologies.  The research findings will influence organizational practices within engineering firms by identifying specific team dynamics and microclimates that facilitate innovation goal achievement by diverse teams.<br/><br/>The project is a large scale quantitative survey linking team diversity and team dynamics to team performance and metrics of innovation, primarily patents. The study will collect data from 5,234 engineering alumni who participated in a prior NSF funded longitudinal study about contextual barriers that impact persistence in engineering careers. It will investigate four research questions: (1) What conditions must be in place to facilitate/hinder demographically and informationally diverse teams to produce innovative solutions? (2) What are the underlying mechanisms by which demographically and informationally diverse teams produce innovative solutions? (3) What are the underlying mechanisms that explain the relationship between demographically and informationally diverse teams, information, discussion process, and innovation? and (4) How do these processes vary over the study period of two years?  The CEM hypothesizes that it is not direct relationships between gender and racially diverse teams and innovation but factors within the team and team dynamics that influence the relationship between diversity and innovation.

With over 50% of the world population and 75% of Americans living in urban areas, the urban climate is becoming the climate and environment experienced by the majority of the world's population. The urban systems upon which these populations rely, including energy, transportation, water, and public health, face unique vulnerabilities to climate change.<br/><br/>The project is developing, deploying and studying a transferable model for urban climate education. Working through Urban Learning Networks (ULN) of community-based organizations in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, DC, and Pittsburgh, CUSP is coordinating programs and messages through three interlinked community platforms that reach residents in neighborhoods, online, and at city festivals. In addition, ULN members in each city work as a community of practice to provide peer support to improve their shared practices in climate change education.  These four, integrated community platforms comprise the CUSP model, connecting the interests and concerns of city residents to the urban systems on which city life depends, systems that are vulnerable to climate hazards and climate change. <br/><br/>The CUSP partnership includes the Franklin Institute (TFI), the Columbia University Center for Climate Systems Research (CCSR), the University of Pittsburgh Learning Research and Development Center (LRDC), the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH), the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), and the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences (Koshland).  Climate researchers on the CUSP team are providing syntheses of climate and climate-change science and climate risk assessments tailored to the CUSP cities. CUSP education researchers are studying the dynamics of learning across CUSP programs, elaborating design principles for learning that spans multiple contexts across a lifetime. External evaluation is focusing on the effectiveness of the CUSP partnership, the capacity of ULNs to deliver CUSP programming, and impacts of CUSP programming on urban audiences.<br/><br/>This project is one of six Phase II projects being funded through the Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) program.  The CCEP program was developed as part of the NSF Climate Change Education program, established through Congressional appropriations in FY 2009.  The CCEP program is a one-time, dedicated NSF effort to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts.  The CCEP portfolio encompasses a major interdisciplinary research and development effort designed to promote deeper understanding of, and engagement with, climate system science and the impacts of climate change on natural and human systems.   The vision of this program is a scientifically literate society that can effectively weigh the evidence regarding global climate change as it confronts the challenges ahead, while preparing the innovative scientific and technical workforce to advance our knowledge of human-climate interactions and develop approaches for a sustainable, prosperous future.  Each CCEP is required to incorporate innovative collaborations among expertise of climate scientists, learning scientists, and education practitioners in either formal or informal learning environments to research, design, and test new models and strategies for effective teaching and learning about climate science.  With its focus on interdisciplinary approaches and transformative scales of impact, the CCEP program occupies a unique and complementary niche in the portfolio of Federal investments related to climate science education and workforce development."

The project builds on a Phase I strategic planning effort to empirically assess the depth and gaps of knowledge about climate science in the San Diego general public and among Key Influentials (KI). These findings have informed the 5-year implementation plan for Phase II and have provided the evidence basis for the development of a multidisciplinary climate literacy model for regional KI community leaders. A robust suite of integrated activities is being implemented that will (1) develop climate science education resources applicable to adult audiences in informal settings, (2) educate Key Influentials and their communities using these resources, (3) assess the effectiveness of these resources and the application of innovative educational methods for learning, and (4) facilitate replication of the process for use in other regions. In particular, Phase II activities are investigating three different educational roles for KIs:  (1) Key Influentials being served as the target audience of climate science education; (2) Key Influentials being trained as knowledgeable messengers to deliver locally-relevant information about climate science and potential impacts to other KIs and their communities; and, (3) Key Influentials serving as the educational portal to their constituents and stakeholders. Each set of activities reflects relevant learning science theory and contemporary methods of dissemination to effectively communicate regional climate observations, models and impacts.

Yet past experience suggests that paths from technological innovation to improved sustainability and productivity entail considerable complexity and uncertainty. Meeting challenges of improving food, energy and water (FEW) systems requires the integration of knowledge from a number of natural sciences as well as from social, political, and ethical domains. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to North Carolina State University will provide graduate students who are enrolled in diverse natural and social science masters and PhD programs with the interdisciplinary knowledge and approaches needed to help forge futures where agricultural biotechnology applications enhance FEW systems while minimizing unintended consequences. In all, the AgBioFEWS program will train at least sixty-two (62) masters and PhD students, including twenty-two (22) funded PhD students, from biological, agricultural, and social sciences. The traineeship program will partner with two historically black universities, offering internships to their students, and will establish a path for these students to join the NRT program. Continuous interaction with experts from industry, government, and non-profit agencies will expose students to diverse career paths. <br/><br/>For a new generation of students to contribute to development and utilization of agricultural biotechnology in ways that enhance FEW systems, they must be able to integrate knowledge and uncertainties from diverse, sophisticated fields of study; understand how facts and values influence decision-making; and establish their trustworthiness through evidence-based engagement with diverse communities. Tapping into North Carolina State's extension network, AgBioFEWS trainees will begin their programs living together in a small farming community situated in an ecologically fragile landscape. They will receive hands-on learning from farmers, extension agents, conservationists, and other public stakeholders in rural North Carolina. This experience is also designed to build team cohesiveness. Subsequent coursework and activities will expand student perspectives on agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems to national and international scales. AgBioFEWS course offerings will be integrated into an established graduate minor in Genetic Engineering and Society and an emerging minor in Public Science. The courses will address techniques of genetic engineering, agriculture, policy analysis, science communication, and other topics needed to prepare students for careers in government, industry, international development, and academia. All AgBioFEWS trainees will participate in an interdisciplinary team project under the direction of 2-3 faculty members, and doctoral trainees are expected to incorporate interdisciplinary agricultural biotechnology and FEW systems into their dissertations.

This study examines the impact of Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (T-STEM) academies on (a) STEM teacher labor markets and (b) students' educational and workforce outcomes. T-STEM academies are public high schools focused on improving instruction and academic performance in science and mathematics-related subjects and expanding the number of students entering STEM careers, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM fields. Analyses draw on a statewide longitudinal student-level dataset covering all students in Texas over a 20-year period. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project objectives are three-fold. First, the study documents whether students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields have equitable access to high-quality STEM teachers across classrooms, schools, and districts. Although prior studies identify a teacher quality gap where disadvantaged students are assigned to less qualified and less effective teachers, no prior studies explore exposure to highly-qualified STEM teachers for advantaged and disadvantaged youth. Second, the study analyzes whether T-STEM academies reduce the STEM teacher quality gap. The third aim of the study is to assess the impact of T-STEM academies on student achievement in math, science, and reading, the likelihood of high school graduation, postsecondary enrollment and completion, as well as students' labor market earnings and the likelihood of employment in a STEM field."

Most scientists are not trained with communication skills that would help them engage with the general public. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Missouri-Columbia will seek to remedy this problem by investigating communication training for graduate students and developing ways to assure its effectiveness. This project brings together a highly interdisciplinary team from biology, physics, strategic communication, journalism, theater, creative writing, and visual design to develop and test the means of evaluating the effectiveness of communication training in graduate programs. The novel pilot will draw on communication research outside the sciences and use statistical evaluation of training effectiveness from multiple points of view, including the public's. The project will result in tools and procedures graduate training programs could use to assure the quality of communications training, and eventually provide better communication between scientists and others.<br/> <br/>Despite widespread agreement on the need for better science communication and a proliferation of training programs, there is little evidence about what approaches actually improve scientists' communication skills. An interdisciplinary team will develop a controlled test bed for communication training in science graduate programs. Longitudinal studies will assess trainees' acquisition and retention over five learning modules. A rigorous statistical design will relate trainees' self-evaluations and instructors' evaluations to responses to survey instruments by hundreds of non-science audience members. Statistical comparison of pre-, post-, and no-training impacts on audiences will establish effectiveness. Trainees will come from the life sciences and later from physical sciences to determine the program's transferability among disciplines.

But the fields of Science and Engineering have a diversity problem which inhibits a vibrant, creative, and diverse talent pool. Many higher education programs have responded to this issue by creating programs intended to narrow the diversity gap in STEM fields. While these efforts have begun to bridge the gap for some underrepresented minority populations, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) remain the least represented group of students in graduate degrees in STEM fields. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Arizona (UA) will improve persistence of AI/AN engineering students and impact faculty perceptions and attitudes through the inclusion of indigenous and more conversational methods of interaction. This project addresses the issue of low numbers of AI/AN science and engineering practitioners by implementing and investigating several culturally relevant program components designed to impact the relationships among AI/AN students, faculty mentors, and Tribal Nation leaders. The novelty of this pilot project is in the systematic implementation and assessment of program modules, grounded in education science and social theories that are hypothesized to dramatically improve persistence of AI/AN in STEM graduate programs, especially in engineering. <br/><br/>This program will transform the graduate education experience for indigenous engineering students and university engineering faculty. The approach acknowledges and leverages the cultural and social capital present in the AI/AN students at UA, and is framed in research on critical race theories and family education models. UA has a unique opportunity to work with the 22 federally recognized tribes that lie within the state of Arizona. These nations occupy over one quarter of Arizona, and are the home to over 250,000 American Indians. This UA-based IGE testbed uses ethnographic methods to study the meaning of actions and events surrounding the concepts of engagement, belongingness, and other components critical to persistence in graduate school study from the perspective of AI/AN students, faculty mentors and Tribal Nation leaders. The model contains four major components that reflect a holistic, empirically-based, systems approach to the successful persistence of AI/AN graduate students: 1) Financial Assistance: partnering with the SLOAN scholarship program at UA for tuition funding for indigenous engineering students; 2) Community-driven research: relationship building with local tribal partners; 3) Indigenous Faculty Mentoring: Indigenous Mentoring Program as part of a faculty training initiative; and 4) providing student integration and professional skills development to increase a sense of belongingness and professional engineering preparation. These four components are individually critical, collectively powerful, and provide an empowering, positive, and persistent graduate academic career for AI/AN students from all tribes and Native communities. Successful elements of the testbed will be scaled to other regions nationwide. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

This lack of practical training persists despite the importance of engaging members of the public in scientific research to support policy decisions and science literacy. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of Rhode Island will address this gap and promote students? scientific learning through communication and engagement. The model to be tested is a training program in academic and non-academic science writing for both graduate students and science faculty, which will include a series of courses, workshops, and internships, the development of a Graduate Science Writing Center, and an emphasis on a variety of writing projects. This project will contribute to the next generation of scientists who can communicate with other scientists and the public and will train a set of faculty who support students in that work. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this program is to work with graduate students and faculty to implement a new cross-disciplinary model of science communication training that integrates diverse types of science writing and communication from the beginning of and throughout graduate students' scientific training. A key to the training model offered is grounding in rhetoric, the academic discipline devoted to the persuasive power of language that includes studies of argument, public discourse, and civic engagement. The rhetorical approach will have three distinct features: habitual writing, multiple genres, and frequent review. Graduate students will write early and often to create a habit of writing. They will practice writing across multiple genres for academic and non-academic audiences. Graduate science writers will plan and draft their writing and then enter a process of review and revision in one-on-one and small group tutorials in classrooms, online peer review forums, and a Graduate Science Writing Center. Workshops for cohorts of Graduate Science Writing Fellows, Faculty Science Writing Fellows, and Faculty Science Writing Mentors will provide a rhetorical foundation and serve as a basis for individual, pedagogical, and curricular change. Faculty Fellows will be guided to adjust syllabi and writing projects for their graduate courses to incorporate more writing earlier in their courses and more opportunities for review and revision. Assessment of short-term and long-term student learning outcomes, writing tool adoption by faculty, programmatic outcomes, and project-level management will determine which components will be carried into the future and can serve as a model for similar programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

Working in teams is challenging for many scientists and engineers because the culture of universities, where they studied, recognizes and rewards individual achievement. For example, a Ph.D. student's final project report, the dissertation, must represent the student's own original contribution. Likewise, universities promote individual faculty members, not groups, through the ranks. Despite the importance of team-based research, universities have historically provided little systematic preparation for science and engineering graduate students to help them succeed in careers involving greater collaboration. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the Georgia Institute of Technology will address these challenges by developing materials to train graduate students to work in teams and by measuring the effectiveness of these materials. The project will take a novel approach to curriculum development by drawing on best practices in team training from a wide range of sources such as the healthcare industry, aviation, and the military. Adaptation of these materials to meet the needs of graduate students will ensure that the students become effective team members and leaders who can advance science and engineering throughout their careers. <br/><br/>This project seeks to determine how graduate students learn to be effective team members and team leaders. The project will investigate which instructional materials and approaches are most effective for students to develop teamwork competencies and which settings are most suitable for learning and retaining specific transportable skills. This project has three goals: (1) develop instructional materials and collaborative processes for team training; (2) implement these instructional materials; and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of instructional materials as well as the processes for developing and implementing team training at the graduate level. Achieving these goals will add to the knowledge base about effective graduate education. The project focuses on three key considerations: competencies, audiences, and settings. The competencies studied by this project are transportable, meaning they are useful in many different areas of research. Examples include knowledge about the nature and value of teamwork, skills in communication and conflict management, and attitudes about diversity and inclusiveness. The audience for the project includes M.S. and Ph.D. students across a wide range of STEM programs. To maximize flexibility, the team will develop curricular materials in small units that faculty can deliver in different settings. Settings where materials will be developed and introduced include existing academic courses, short (60-90 minute) or longer (half day, full day) workshops, and semester-long academic courses. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

However, achieving such integration through collaborative team science (research conducted by more than one discipline in an interdependent manner) has proven elusive due in large part to deficiencies in key professional, teamwork, and leadership skills among the team members. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the College of William & Mary's (W&M) Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) seeks to address these deficiencies by designing and testing team science professional development training for coastal ocean and estuarine STEM graduate students. The project will be implemented through the Virginia Sea Grant College, which is composed of VIMS/W&M, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and George Mason, James Madison, Old Dominion, and Virginia Commonwealth Universities.<br/><br/>The project assembles a multi-disciplinary team of faculty facilitators to guide a class of diverse doctoral and master's students from the natural and physical coastal, marine and environmental sciences, engineering, design, and social and economic sciences. An innovative workshop series trains students in the principles of team science, collaborative leadership, and effective self-reflective tools and strategies to improve teamwork. Working closely with coastal community partners (e.g., municipalities, NGOs), this community-based climate-resilience project enables students to practice team science research and use reflective practices to improve their competencies in teamwork. Assessment of the reflective practices (using team reflexivity, Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness, and expertise coordination measures) will improve understanding of how to nurture self-reflective competencies in the short-term and build capacity for team science research that will enhance students' careers over the long term. The lesson plans, training modules, and implementation strategies will be compiled into an online toolkit and shared broadly through professional societies of graduate school deans, multiple conference presentations, and workshops, and extended through alumni networks at the participating institutions for peer mentoring and executive coaching. Further, collaboration with the Virginia Council of Graduate Schools will help to enhance recruitment of diverse participants, reinforce learning with workshop alumni, promote global dissemination, and institutionalize benefits into existing courses and degree programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Yet the barriers to success these groups face are often not adequately addressed by traditional methods of mentoring and professionalization in science. Minority-serving institutions are uniquely poised to foster diverse science leaders, but they also require a systematic, integrated, program-wide approach geared toward nurturing and validating students' identities as scientists. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Texas San Antonio cultivates science identity by integrating holistic mentoring with systematic training in science writing and public science communication. This program will test an innovative and potentially transformative model for diversifying science that engages both faculty and graduate students from the department of Environmental Science and Ecology in a community-supported, holistic, and systematic approach. The project will utilize a series of graduate courses, professional workshops, and community-based activities that seek to foster and validate underrepresented minority students' science identity. Nationally, these interventions may exist informally, but they are rarely, if ever, fully integrated into a coherent graduate STEM program. Developing diverse leaders in science professions is crucial as scientists navigate interdisciplinary knowledge demands and cultural challenges in a globalized and media-saturated world. <br/><br/>The goal of this IGE project is to cultivate a science identity for underrepresented minority graduate students through the acquisition of a knowledge base (competence), the ability to perform science practices (performance), and the acknowledgement by significant others in the field (recognition). The researchers propose that fostering these identity components and making them visible in scientific disciplines and public communities can be achieved through three interrelated interventions: holistic mentoring, writing-to-learn science, and public science communication. Holistic mentoring, both in and outside the classroom environment will provide the underlying framework necessary to address the needs and challenges faced by underrepresented minority students. In addition, this project hypothesizes that holistic mentoring transforms the challenges of systematic training in research-based science writing and public science communication into opportunities to validate students' scientific competence and leadership skills. The project will use a mixed-methods assessment approach to analyze not only each intervention but also on the relationships among all three interventions. Therefore, it seeks to provide an evidence-based validation of the impact of holistic mentoring and systematic communications training on cultivating a scientific ethos for underrepresented minority graduate students. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.  The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will have an immediate impact on the information assurance and forensics capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with general computing and security skills. Both public and private organizations developing and maintaining information and operational technology, or real-time control systems, are in urgent need of graduates with a strong cybersecurity background. The graduates from the UI's SFS program increase the security and resiliency of federal, state, tribal, and territorial governments' security systems. The program has a holistic educational approach with strong computational foundations and hands-on experiences; and the interdisciplinary nature of the program aids in attracting women and minorities to the cybersecurity profession. <br/><br/>The program is graduating skilled information assurance and forensics professionals with strong leadership skills and a commitment to public service. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. Graduates from the UI's SFS program have a foundational knowledge strongly rooted in mathematics and scientific theory, a practical skillset learned through hands-on laboratories, and a research-oriented innovative approach to problem solving. They will also develop the presentation, communication, and management skills necessary to be effective in the federal workforce. This enables them to design, develop, and maintain secure and resilient computing systems critical to the government, digital economy, and national security. By grouping students from multiple disciplines into the same labs and seminars the program provides a diversity and synergy that enables participants to appreciate the multifaceted aspects of cybersecurity, including perspectives from software, hardware, and management.

The research extends Tinto's university departure model to include the career exploration process where a student leaves STEM but remains in college. The framework will be developed and tested by extensive measurement of demographic, social, academic, affective (self-efficacy, self-esteem, belonging), career exploration/aspirations and psychological variables at four longitudinal points in physics and mathematics introductory class sequences required for many STEM majors. The longitudinal measurement monitors evolution of a student's STEM career commitment and vocational identity, and determines factors that influence a decision to begin the process of STEM departure or lead to a well-investigated resolution to pursue a STEM career. The research will explore crucial questions influencing university STEM departure, including to what extent departure is preventable by modifying advising protocols, to what extent performance in these gate-keeper classes and its effect on self-efficacy influence the decision to change major, what psychological/social factors mark students beginning to explore non-STEM careers, and to what extent belonging influences retention, particularly of underrepresented women and rural students.  The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of this important phenomenon. It also will inform the national discussion of STEM retention by producing a theoretical framework of STEM departure validated across a large, economically diverse pool of students. <br/><br/>The research design will implement a multi-stage analysis and measurement with the goal of modeling the process of STEM departure and quantifying the reasons for and markers of the departure process. Researchers will investigate in depth: (1) what modifications are needed in theoretical frameworks for college departure to explain intra-university departure from STEM disciplines, (2) the minimum information required to predict STEM departure and where STEM departure originates, (3) what fraction of STEM departure could be prevented by interventions, (4) how STEM departure markers differ for underserved populations, and (5) how to identify subpopulations of students where interventions will be most effective. Researchers will use institutional class-taking and outcome data to build a set of ""survival"" probabilities for individual classes and class-taking sequences. Linear regression analysis then be used to analyze how these probabilities are affected by (1) the student's intrinsic characteristics (ability measured by ACT/SAT, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first generation status, and personality profile), (2) the student's academic preparation (high school GPA and high school course-taking patterns), (3) the student's academic performance in his or her current class (measured by attendance patterns and assignment grades), (4) the students current social connectedness to both family and university structures and communities, and (5) the student's current affective state, his or her self-efficacy, sense of belonging, self-esteem, and STEM identity. Latent growth modeling will track changes in these factors over time. In parallel, the student's vocational identity status, his or her state of career exploration and career decision making, will be monitored. Using the four-point longitudinal measurement, transitions in the student's vocational identity state (particularly changes that indicate a renewed career exportation process and therefore the threat of STEM departure) will be correlated with previous changes in survival probabilities and with changes in the student's affective, academic, or social state. Signatures to inform advisers of at risk students and general changes to advising protocols will be developed. Campus social/academic structures that promote retention will be identified. At all levels, differential results for underrepresented students will be investigated with the goal of designing interventions that target these populations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and workforce development."

To help address the threats of cyberspace and the knowledge gaps in cybersecurity curricula, this collaborative project between Penn State University (PSU) and Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) proposes to: (1) develop a fraud informatics curriculum with three delivery options (15-week-long offline, 5-week-long online, and 1-day offline), and (2) validate the effectiveness of this curriculum and learning materials by assessing changes in participants' knowledge, skills, and behaviors.<br/><br/>This project will incorporate research-based pedagogical methods (i.e., group-based learning, context-based learning, and hands-on learning) to develop learning materials in three delivery options. The curriculum will be uniquely cohesive in its emphasis on recent online fraud and phenomena such as spam emails, social engineering attacks, astroturfing, misinformation, disinformation and data-driven solutions for detecting and preventing such frauds. The curriculum will be delivered by approximately 10 instructors to 400 undergraduate students in the Appalachian region and beyond. The goal is for the curriculum to strengthen the workforce development pipeline, and to ultimately contribute to an unrivaled, diverse cybersecurity workforce and citizenry.

One possible reason is that students are treated as passive recipients with linear and fragmented teaching presentations that provide no opportunity for learning the holistic nature of the discipline. Further, quantum cryptographic equipment is expensive and beyond the reach of most universities.  At the same time, project-based learning environments are proven more likely to meet educational objectives compared to traditional lectures. QuaSim is a pedagogical game-based simulator that allows students an interactive experience to improve learning by transforming subject-based lectures in quantum cryptography into project-based virtual simulations.<br/><br/>The knowledge components in QuaSim are codified in a highly expressive first-order logic augmented with abductive reasoning to generate explanations for user interactions and solutions. A continual adaptive framework generates customized scenarios and mine responses to measurably improve learning. While a user who is repeatedly able to solve problems without hints is led to harder and/or timed problems, a user repeatedly performing erroneous interactions is fed into pre-defined and automatically learned error models to identify the responsible knowledge component and prescribed scenarios with hints to address knowledge gaps. QuaSim is perhaps the first game-based simulator for quantum cryptography that incorporates abductive theorem proving along with data analysis to continuously adapt game scenarios based on user performance to measurably improve learning. Such adaptations enable instructors to empirically and quantifiably relate student performance to knowledge components and design lesson plans. QuaSim is expected to improve the quality and efficiency of undergraduate and graduate STEM education."

The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), in collaboration with the Tuskegee University (TU), launches a new Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to graduate highly capable and talented cybersecurity professionals with Master's degrees. Both UTC and TU host a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education/Cyber Defense (CAE IA/CD), designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. As such, both institutions are well equipped to prepare SFS scholars for cybersecurity careers in local, state, and federal governments. <br/><br/>The proposed new SFS program recruits exceptional students through academic and community outreach initiatives. Strategies include recruiting from the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team, Honor College, and outreaching to other institutions. The SFS scholars will be selected based on a holistic consideration of credential ranking and group diversity. The SFS program will implement cohort programs, and students will gain common cohort experiences including: taking common curriculum in each cohort; attending monthly forums or field trips; conducting collaborative research; participating in security conferences; joining CCDC; and conducting K-12 outreach. These strong and well-designed academic programs, combined with high-quality student services, and paired with a network of industry partnerships, will help prepare quality professionals in cybersecurity. The SFS program will also assist scholars' transition into government through mentorship and career planning efforts. This project will strengthen the cybersecurity workforce by graduating well-trained cybersecurity professionals to defend the cyber-infrastructure, critical infrastructure, citizen privacy, and daily activities in cyberspace. The partnership between UTC and TU (a strong HBCU school) will help diversify the cybersecurity workforce. The knowledge and experiences gained through this program will be disseminated in regional and national conferences, workshops, and journals to inspire collaboration among institutions, government, and industry in creating and training highly capable cybersecurity professionals. Through outreach to local communities and K-12 schools, including those with large populations of underrepresented groups in computing, this project will promote awareness of the cybersecurity issues that the nation faces as well as disseminate basic knowledge about information security."

Workforce development through cyber education and training are key towards protecting the ever-growing cyberspace and cyberinfrastructure. However, US universities are not graduating nearly sufficient workforce in the IT areas, let alone cybersecurity. Academic programs in STEM and IT fields are uniquely positioned to address this need. Tailoring curricula in these areas to include cyber education can bridge the gap existing between the demand and supply of trained workforce. Existing certificate programs do not offer a data analytics perspective along with a software security and network security perspective for undergraduate curricula. In addition, the existing certificates are not seamlessly integrated with the existing curriculum towards a bachelor?s degree. This project is motivated to fill this gap.<br/><br/>The key objective of this project is to increase the capacity in the cybersecurity workforce by creating, delivering and assessing a new undergraduate certificate program in cybersecurity. This will include developing a model curriculum and material for undergraduate cyber education grounded on the pedagogical literature. In addition, this project will design and develop intervention strategies using peer mentoring between advanced cybersecurity courses and an entry level Information Systems course. This will provide a framework for learning and retention through peer mentoring, early intervention strategies, group engagement, critical thinking through capstone projects, and individualized learning of deeper issues in cybersecurity through one-on-one interactions with faculty. A certificate program will be designed to increase interest in cyber education as well as increase retention and completion of the program by undergraduate students. The project will also include qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the effectiveness of the certificate program. The certificate program will (a) Develop skills in technical, analytical, software security, and critical thinking, (b) Allow students to apply the knowledge gained to projects that simulate real-life problems, (c) Nurture and support innovative thinking in solving some of the key challenges facing the cyber world, (d) Expose students to various career opportunities in the cyber industry and connect them with relevant professional groups, and (e) Increase the cybersecurity workforce capacity to support this pervasive area with a growing importance in society. The certificate program will result in products and outcomes that can be used as a model for adoption in other undergraduate curricula in computing."

This is currently a challenge because such tasks are often open-ended and exploratory in nature. Because they can be completed in many ways, student learning in cybersecurity may not always be recognized by the instructor. This makes it hard to assess the sophistication of a student's path to success. Similarly, it may also be a challenge to identify the reasons why students experience failure, and to provide useful and timely feedback to students and instructors. The proposed project work will uncover reasons behind student underperformance in practical cybersecurity exercises, and will help identify effective interventions. The proposed research may also help network test beds retain and better serve their users. The impact of these activities will be three-fold. First, the developed tools will be integrated with two previously developed platforms for cybersecurity exercises: DeterLab and EDURange. This will directly impact approximately 2,000 students annually. Second, the tools will be highly portable to other platforms that use Linux in practical cybersecurity exercises, and can reach a wider audience. Third, the tools will help retain talent from disadvantaged and minority populations, as it will allow for earlier intervention and feedback to complete challenging, practical tasks. <br/><br/>This project will develop ACSLE, a framework for automated assessment of student learning in practical cybersecurity exercises. ACSLE will engage in constant and extensive monitoring of student interaction with the computer, and will allow for the correlation with desired learning outcomes. ACSLE starts with the development of tools that monitor low-level student activities, such as commands typed, traffic generated and files and processes created. These low-level records are then synthesized into high-level indicators of student progress on a given cybersecurity task. The outcomes will allow for: (1) classification of students into several learning styles based on proficiency with a task and level of foundational skill; (2) clustering of solutions to specific learning challenges identified in student groups that have similar learning styles; (3) collection of successful learning paths developed over time and  methods for identifying struggling students; (4) identification of causes of failure and delivery of appropriate learning interventions; and (5) aggregation of performance data for a class as well as identification of tasks that are difficult for many students. ACSLE will thus provide useful information for students and teachers, and improve overall learning in practical cybersecurity exercises."

People continue to live longer and the U.S. population is becoming older and more racially and ethnically diverse. There is also an increase in younger individuals living with a life-long disability, such as veterans who sustain catastrophic injuries, persons suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and children growing up with developmental disorders or delays.  With this changing population profile comes an increasing demand for advanced healthcare technologies and a need to train a new generation of engineers able to develop these new technologies. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship award to the Georgia Institute of Technology will address this demand by training graduate master's and doctoral students in the interdisciplinary field of healthcare robotics. The traineeship anticipates providing a unique and comprehensive training opportunity for one hundred and fifty-five (155) students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, by combining disciplines in robotics, studies in health sciences, interactions with clinical partners, hands-on rehabilitation research, and a culture of innovation and translational research. <br/><br/>Trainees will have unique exposure to a variety of approaches developed in Robotics, Physiology, Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, and Psychology. The traineeship will bridge the gap between healthcare and robotics by addressing two major barriers:  a) the lack of a formalized framework to enable interdisciplinary collaborations between robotics engineers and health professionals; b) the tendency for students in robotics to be unprepared to address problems in healthcare, including a lack of appreciation for the challenges encountered by clinicians, caregivers, and people with disabilities.  Through close interactions with various partners, the traineeship will expand student horizons beyond a technology-first mentality to consider challenges in developing robotic solutions that address the needs of clinicians, caregivers, and people with disabilities.  The goal is to develop an interdisciplinary curriculum based upon the concept of participatory design, problem-based learning, and an immersive research experience that blends techniques from multiple disciplines to solve problems posed in healthcare.  A second major goal of the traineeship is to increase the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities in robotics and related engineering fields. The project will develop a new M.S. degree program in healthcare robotics and a new PhD concentration area in healthcare robotics as well as curricular materials and best-practices to allow other institutions to develop similar programs.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

The program will provide doctoral students with the skills and knowledge base to develop and utilize miniature brain machinery in an effort to understand and regulate brain activities. To achieve the goals of developing cross-disciplinary researchers, trainees will learn diverse fundamentals in biology, mathematics, engineering, and cognitive science, relevant to miniature brain machinery. The training grant anticipates providing a unique and comprehensive training opportunity for sixty (60) PhD students, including thirty four (34) funded trainees. Trainees will be recruited from neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, molecular and integrative physiology, chemistry, chemical and biomolecular engineering, bioengineering, electrical and computer engineering, and psychology. The training program will foster a culture of innovation and translational research, and will produce a new generation of scientists and engineers prepared to tackle major problems in brain studies that can improve the quality of human life.<br/><br/>The research and training program will bridge two dominant, non-overlapping brain research paradigms: i) cognitive and behavioral studies, focused principally on understanding of adaptation, decision-making, psychology, and learning of an individual using bioimaging and computational tools vs. ii) cell and tissue studies, focused on activities of multiple neuronal cells by altering their internal and external microenvironments comprised of biomolecules, extracellular matrix, and external stimuli. The goal of this NRT training program is to unite these two dominant paradigms in brain science studies and bridge the expertise of cell and molecular biologists, physiologists, chemists, nano/micro technologists, and cognitive neuroscientists. This training program prepares students for studies that enable control over the networks producing behavior and thus to study causal relations. The overarching goal of the program is to provide students with an interdisciplinary curriculum grounded in problem-based learning and an immersive research experience that blends techniques from multiple disciplines. A second goal is to increase the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and students with disabilities in neuroscience, life sciences, chemical sciences, and engineering fields. A third goal is to train students in communication skills with the public. Evaluative studies conducted throughout this research traineeship project will explore the dynamics and efficacy of interdisciplinary collaboration by students in this program. Project outcomes will be a demonstrated, evaluated model for transformative graduate training that is effective in developing broadly trained professionals. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Scientists and engineers are generally not taught how to engage with the community as part of their research. teaching, or other long-term career goals. Graduate students often do not know how to access training in community engagement, are unaware of its importance, and/or lack the confidence or experience to take part. This project, the Public Service Fellows Program, will test a year-long professional development program as a means to prepare graduate students to view public service as a responsibility that comes with their scientific training. It will provide practical experience working with community partners on science-focused issues and projects. Integrating public service into STEM graduate student training will improve the practice of future generations of scientists by teaching the specific skills and mindsets needed for community engagement. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Wisconsin-Madison will strengthen ties between the scientific community and the public by training science and engineering graduate students to develop meaningful relationships and impactful, mutually beneficial projects with a wide variety of community partners. Graduate students from any STEM discipline will be able to incorporate issues of public concern into their career goals, whether they will pursue careers in academia, education, outreach, business, or policy. <br/><br/>The model being tested is a ""Learn, Prepare, Implement"" sequence where public service fellows will experience increasing levels of independence, beginning with a grounding in foundational knowledge and progressing to a science-focused practicum experience working directly with a community partner. Fellows will be able to design their experience around one of four tracks: community-engaged teaching, direct service, policy, and social enterprise. Assessment will focus on two primary research questions: (1) What are graduate students' motivations to participate in the Public Service Fellows Program? and (2) How do students' professional identities change as a result of participation in the Public Service Fellows Program, and what component(s) of the program are primary contributors to these changes? The hypotheses are that community engagement will become a more integrated part of the fellows' professional identities, that graduate students who participate in the program will have an increased commitment to a community-engagement, regardless of career path, and that the biggest impact will be due to the in-depth practicum portion of the Public Service Fellows Program. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Kansas State University will prepare students to become science-based leaders and advocates for resilient rural communities by combining engineering, economics, and sociological knowledge to meet the needs of farmers, industry, and society. Students will engage with farmers, government and industry through interactive sessions and will develop relevant skills through innovative coursework and teamwork.  This comprehensive program anticipates training fifty (50) master's and doctoral students, including twenty-five (25) funded trainees, from the colleges of engineering, arts and sciences, and agriculture, <br/><br/>A resilient food, energy, and water system in Western Kansas and other semi-arid regions requires sufficient capacity to adapt to short-term shocks and long-term adverse conditions (e.g., further groundwater depletion, growing competition for water between food and energy interests, increasing resource demands for fertilizer production). The interdisciplinary research efforts funded through this project will focus on resource conservation, recovery, and reuse for sustainable agriculture, including: (1) innovations for soil, water and microbial systems in the face of drought, (2) hydrologic science and water conservation systems for efficient food production, and (3) anaerobic bioreactors to transform animal waste into usable energy, water, and fertilizer. Engineering innovations alone will not bring about more resilient rural communities; it is critical that solutions also address perceptions, barriers, and attitudes among stakeholders to meet their shorter-term needs while enabling transitions to more resilient system dynamics over longer time frames. NRT training through this program will create culturally competent, interdisciplinary problem-solvers through immersive experiences with producers and industry in Southwest Kansas, policy makers in the state capital, and interdisciplinary coursework that integrates theory, practice, and international discussions. In addition, outreach to agricultural high school teachers will develop trainee leadership skills and trainee success will be supported by team-based faculty and peer mentoring.  <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This new interdisciplinary field has the potential to transform fundamental science, industry, medicine, and our way of life. To achieve these innovations, industry will require a workforce that collaborates across disciplines to develop devices that enable measurement, manipulation, control and sensing of biological processes of organisms, cells, molecules and reactions. Because this industry will change how we interact with each other, this topic will present new policy, economic, and environmental issues to solve. The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to William Marsh Rice University will address these challenges by training graduate doctoral students in the interdisciplinary field of bioelectronics. The project anticipates training thirty (30) doctoral students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences doctoral programs. <br/><br/>Students typically begin training in disciplinary graduate programs, and collaboration follows after investing significant time into defining the research problem, often through co-mentored apprenticeships. This educational model is thought to limit the kinds of questions that students pursue because students are not poised to effectively integrate into the type of teams required for bioelectronics innovation. To overcome these limitations, this NRT program will integrate a team-first pedagogical model for doctoral training with bioelectronics research to educate students about past interdisciplinary innovations, theoretical underpinnings of interdisciplinarity, creation of cohesive teams and community building, frameworks for achieving conceptual understanding across disciplines, and strategies to understand the needs of stakeholders. Research activities centered on bioelectronics themes encompass diverse topics, such as light-harvesting systems that enable chemical synthesis within cells, instruments that monitor complex electrical signaling in the nervous system, and living sensors that interface with handheld devices. This traineeship program will also provide training in effective communication, teaching and mentorship, conflict resolution, leadership and management, responsible conduct in research, and outreach. Students will work in interdisciplinary teams to identify bioelectronics questions, perform team-based research, and generate joint publications.

Such devices are not limited to traditional computers and smart phones, but are increasingly extended to cover a wide variety of embedded systems (ES), such as sensors monitoring bridges, electronics controlling the operation of automobiles and industrial equipment, home medicine devices that are constantly reporting patient health information to doctors. While the wide deployment of networked ES significantly benefits various aspects of human life and society at large, it also poses daunting security challenges that can put national security as well as the privacy of ordinary citizens at risk. Adequately addressing such challenges requires advanced technologies to be developed by industries and ES designers as well as users to be well educated about the security related issues. To facilitate technology development and better educate future designers, this project develops curricula focusing on the unique challenges of the emerging ES security, which has not been systemically covered in existing computer security related curricula that emphasize security in computers and the traditional Internet.<br/><br/>This project makes intellectual contributions through the completion of the following objectives: 1) developing course modules (lecture notes, labs and evaluation questionnaire) to introduce ES security in the layers of software, networking, operating system, architecture, and hardware; 2) integrating the developed material into several existing undergraduate courses at PIs' Universities; 3) establishing a unified ES security course with two versions (computer engineering and computer science versions) by integrating the developed course modules; 4) getting the developed material evaluated by an External Advisory/Review Committee; 5) teaching the developed material using both project-based learning and flipped classroom learning; 6) assessing the proposed teaching methods using formative and summative approaches; 7) broadly disseminating the developed material and promoting diversity in ES security education. Material to be developed will reach over 100 students per year, including many minorities and women."

In China, the world's largest exporter, more than half of the country's population lives along its industrialized coastlines. Population densities in the United States are highest in coastal counties, representing 39% of the U.S. population. In such densely populated areas, human activity related to the generation and use of food, energy and water has been linked to impacts such as nitrogen pollution that degrades the quality of coastal waters. This degradation affects reef ecosystems, fisheries, and people's economic livelihoods and health. Replenishment requires innovative systems thinking and better consideration of the way food, energy, and water systems are integrated in terrestrial and coastal environments. Systems thinking considers the whole system including engineered infrastructure, the environment, and sociocultural aspects, rather than an assembly of isolated parts. Integrating sociocultural dynamics and meaningful engagement of community stakeholders is fundamental to this approach. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of South Florida (USF) and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) will develop a community-engaged training and research program in systems thinking. Graduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students will design innovative, holistic solutions (e.g., technological, organizational) to better manage complex and interconnected food, energy, and water systems in coastal locations. The project will train 109 graduate students, including 23 funded PhD-level trainees from engineering and applied anthropology at USF and 6 MS-level trainees from marine and environmental sciences from the Historically Black University partner, UVI in four locations: Tampa, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Belize. This award will prepare students to create innovative systems to address complex problems and will serve as a model for training a STEM-focused workforce.<br/><br/>The research supporting this training program focuses on the leverage points (technological, policy, and organizational) in designing food-energy-water systems in a specific geographic context to improve the sustainability of the overall system across different scales. This NRT will advance graduate training through: 1) a transformative research training framework guiding students to conceptualize the interactions between food-energy-water systems and define their research questions from a systems perspective; 2) a context based interdisciplinary training approach including newly developed co-taught courses, multi-discipline field-based training and research experiences that take place in the U.S. and internationally, and strong partnerships with local practitioners and community-grounded organizations; and 3) learning outcomes of our program in terms of interdisciplinary, 21st century, and local and global competency skills of graduate students and impactful research in the management of resources for food, energy, and water security. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program.  The LSAMP program supports comprehensive, evidence-based, and sustained approaches to broadening participation of students from racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM."

This can lead to challenging land use competition where local FEW needs cannot be met with current land use practice. For instance, in areas where solar energy is produced, standard solar panels can cast large ground shadows on agricultural land throughout the day, which greatly impedes crop growth. An urgent need exists to develop solutions for sustainable FEW systems (SFEWS) where food, energy, and water needs can be met using available land collaboratively rather than competitively. One approach could be to use the entire solar spectrum to maximize resource production from a given land area. Achieving such solutions requires effective interdisciplinary education and training to generate the resources and human capital for leadership for a sustainable solar economy. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Purdue University and Florida A&M University will form an interdisciplinary traineeship program that will train graduate students in the skills needed to produce sustainable supplies of food, energy and water (FEW) for a more heavily populated earth. The project anticipates training 48 PhD students, including 24 funded trainees, from agronomy, agricultural and biological engineering, electrical and computer engineering, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, chemistry, and agricultural economics.<br/><br/>The SFEWS project aims to meet food, energy and water management needs locally with local solar energy. Achieving this state requires studying highly complex systems with previously unappreciated interdependencies and then developing innovative solutions by combining basic scientific and technical principles from the diverse fields of agriculture, engineering, and science. Out of many possibilities,  solutions will be identified based on their system-wide simplicity, economic impact, and environmental footprint, in light of government policy and social impact.

This can lead to challenging land use competition where local FEW needs cannot be met with current land use practice. For instance, in areas where solar energy is produced, standard solar panels can cast large ground shadows on agricultural land throughout the day, which greatly impedes crop growth. An urgent need exists to develop solutions for sustainable FEW systems (SFEWS) where food, energy, and water needs can be met using available land collaboratively rather than competitively. One approach could be to use the entire solar spectrum to maximize resource production from a given land area. Achieving such solutions requires effective interdisciplinary education and training to generate the resources and human capital for leadership for a sustainable solar economy. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Purdue University and Florida A&M University will form an interdisciplinary traineeship program that will train graduate students in the skills needed to produce sustainable supplies of food, energy and water (FEW) for a more heavily populated earth. The project anticipates training 48 PhD students, including 24 funded trainees, from agronomy, agricultural and biological engineering, electrical and computer engineering, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, chemistry, and agricultural economics.<br/><br/>The SFEWS project aims to meet food, energy and water management needs locally with local solar energy. Achieving this state requires studying highly complex systems with previously unappreciated interdependencies and then developing innovative solutions by combining basic scientific and technical principles from the diverse fields of agriculture, engineering, and science. Out of many possibilities,  solutions will be identified based on their system-wide simplicity, economic impact, and environmental footprint, in light of government policy and social impact.

In China, the world's largest exporter, more than half of the country's population lives along its industrialized coastlines. Population densities in the United States are highest in coastal counties, representing 39% of the U.S. population. In such densely populated areas, human activity related to the generation and use of food, energy and water has been linked to impacts such as nitrogen pollution that degrades the quality of coastal waters. This degradation affects reef ecosystems, fisheries, and people's economic livelihoods and health. Replenishment requires innovative systems thinking and better consideration of the way food, energy, and water systems are integrated in terrestrial and coastal environments. Systems thinking considers the whole system including engineered infrastructure, the environment, and sociocultural aspects, rather than an assembly of isolated parts. Integrating sociocultural dynamics and meaningful engagement of community stakeholders is fundamental to this approach. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of South Florida (USF) and the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) will develop a community-engaged training and research program in systems thinking. Graduate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) students will design innovative, holistic solutions (e.g., technological, organizational) to better manage complex and interconnected food, energy, and water systems in coastal locations. The project will train 109 graduate students, including 23 funded PhD-level trainees from engineering and applied anthropology at USF and 6 MS-level trainees from marine and environmental sciences from the Historically Black University partner, UVI in four locations: Tampa, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Barbados and Belize. This award will prepare students to create innovative systems to address complex problems and will serve as a model for training a STEM-focused workforce.<br/><br/>The research supporting this training program focuses on the leverage points (technological, policy, and organizational) in designing food-energy-water systems in a specific geographic context to improve the sustainability of the overall system across different scales. This NRT will advance graduate training through: 1) a transformative research training framework guiding students to conceptualize the interactions between food-energy-water systems and define their research questions from a systems perspective; 2) a context based interdisciplinary training approach including newly developed co-taught courses, multi-discipline field-based training and research experiences that take place in the U.S. and internationally, and strong partnerships with local practitioners and community-grounded organizations; and 3) learning outcomes of our program in terms of interdisciplinary, 21st century, and local and global competency skills of graduate students and impactful research in the management of resources for food, energy, and water security. <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

To address this issue, the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Arizona, in partnership with Din College and Navajo Technical University, will develop a diverse STEM workforce with intercultural awareness and multidisciplinary knowledge/skills for high priority research in sustainable food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). Such systems are appropriate in many remote regions of the world. By partnering with Din College and Navajo Technical University, the project will directly engage underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Trainees will major in traditional disciplines while completing the program, which consists of internships, a FEWS-themed minor, professional development, and immersion in indigenous communities. Trainees will participate in the design and construction of pilot-scale capstone projects in dispersed water purification and greenhouse system design in underserved areas of the Navajo Nation. The projects will produce learning models for FEWS infrastructure development in areas that cannot be served from central facilities. The traineeship will provide stipends for 12 MS and 14 PhD students from several related science and engineering disciplines. Eleven students not funded by NSF will complete the program (6 MS and 5 PhD). It is anticipated that an additional 40 students will complete the FEWS minor and about 400 students will be impacted through participation in enriched courses cross-listed in multiple departments. <br/><br/>The traineeship centers on the development of novel, sustainable solutions for off-grid production of safe drinking water and controlled environment agriculture systems. Research will focus on innovative photovoltaics, holographics, sensors and controls, desalination of brackish water, brine treatment and disposal, and materials and systems resiliency. Food-energy-water systems will be integrated with cultural norms, working collaboratively with indigenous communities using a coupled natural human systems approach to design/build culturally acceptable technology. The research program will employ (1) the use of semi-transparent organic photovoltaic materials sheets as greenhouse cover to provide light of sufficient intensity and quality to achieve substantial, high-quality crop yields while powering off-grid controlled environment agriculture systems, and (2) solar-driven nanofiltration devices operated with algal bioreactors to produce potable and irrigation water using a treatment strategy tailored to the use of the water. In both areas, the program will draw on indigenous knowledge of land and water practices to make these technical innovations acceptable for widespread public use.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Innovations from this approach will address societal challenges in education, technology, and health. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: A full understanding of human language ? including genetic, neural, cognitive and environmental influences that shape language development and recovery from brain injury ? requires linking a vast array of biological and cognitive sciences. Conventional approaches to graduate training produce cognitive and biological language scientists with little technical overlap ? a barrier to communication. Trainees will develop expertise in their home domains and rigorous interdisciplinary training, providing broad and deep knowledge of theories and methods of other domains to communicate, collaborate and innovate in multidisciplinary teams. The training program uses a team-based model, in an environment designed to foster creativity and innovation ? along with integrated coursework and training in how to translate that research to educational, technological, and health applications.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This IGERT award will prepare a new generation of leaders to conduct (and train others to conduct) the team-based basic and applied research needed to achieve a unified biological-cognitive science of language. Key components include: training to communicate with educators, policy makers and the public in innovative ways that address societal challenges in technology and education; comprehensive efforts to increase participation among historically underrepresented groups in science; and preparing trainees for the increasingly international scientific community through on-site and internet-based opportunities to connect with leading cognitive and biological centers of language research around the world.<br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.<br/>"

They must also be able to think creatively, to collaborate across disciplines, and to work with people with different perspectives, knowledge, and values. There is compelling evidence that creativity training can stimulate both scientific creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration, but to date, little attention has been given to creativity training in STEM graduate education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Georgia will bring a diverse group of graduate students together from STEM and arts disciplines to address issues in the local watershed using creativity-based training methods from the arts. This project will investigate the impact of targeted creativity training on the ability of STEM students to frame problems in new ways and help diverse teams solve complex problems. If successful, widespread adoption of these methods will contribute to equipping STEM graduates across the country with communication and collaboration skills and ultimately increase creative and innovative solutions to complex global environmental challenges.<br/><br/>Over each of five semesters, this project will recruit a cohort of ten students in the early stages of graduate study, five from STEM disciplines who self-identify as interested in environmental science, and five from arts disciplines. Cohorts will meet for six workshops facilitated by two faculty members from STEM and arts disciplines. Workshops are designed to build core creative competencies and develop skills for collaborative interdisciplinary practice. Students will gain practical experience sharing disciplinary viewpoints, creating analogies from scientific concepts, and developing collaborative frameworks for complex problem solving. The final workshop will result in a set of proposed solutions to a local watershed problem, collaboratively identified by students and stakeholders. Complementary quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to examine students' abilities to shift thinking (increase ""cognitive flexibility""), generate novel ideas, and effectively communicate and collaborate with one another. This project seeks to fundamentally enhance how STEM students are educated by engaging them in creative processes related to their research topics. Successful elements will be incorporated into a scalable training model that will be widely disseminated and available for adoption at other institutions.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Miami University will pilot and test a Graduate Student Learning Community (GSLC) model aimed at closing that gap.  This innovative approach to STEM graduate student mentoring synthesizes knowledge from the scholarship of teaching and learning, psychology, and chemistry education to build a robust year-long experience. The goals of the project are to develop the STEM graduate students' sense of identity, sense of community, and ability to communicate with non-scientists. Beyond positively influencing the participants in the GSLC, the project will advance graduate education in a number of ways. First, the members of the GSLC are themselves actors within their specific research groups, departments, and professions; greater identity clarity, community, and communication skills among these students can in turn positively impact their broader cultures. Second, the curriculum in this project can be implemented and tailored to meet the needs of graduate students at other universities. Finally, the focused attention on communicating to non-specialists will increase the potential reach of STEM topics to scientists outside of one's own specialty and to the broader public.<br/><br/>This project will develop an interdisciplinary Graduate Student Learning Community (GSLC). In two cohorts, each one year in length, this project will mentor and enhance the skills of STEM graduate students in chemistry and psychology. As part of the GSLC, the two cohorts of STEM graduate students will develop individualized professional development plans; receive regular career mentoring; and participate in an evidence-based curriculum designed to explore their professional identity, build community, and improve their ability to communicate with non-specialists. The project will specifically test the effectiveness of the GSLC model to foster professional identity, sense of community, and communication skills.  Evaluation will involve comparison within cohorts using pre-and post-assessments, as well as against a control group of non-participants. The curriculum developed in this project will be transferable across disciplines and universities thereby broadening the impact on STEM graduate education. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

The program integrates rigorous, hands-on learning with research, professional development and outreach activities. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. The Tulsa Program offers multiple technical and interdisciplinary tracks, each characterized by a focused, yet flexible, program of study. The intense ""MacGyver Track"" imparts reverse engineering and cyber operations skills geared for the intelligence community. Other tracks prepare students for research, operations and project management. The interdisciplinary M.B.A. and Law Tracks combine business and law classes, respectively, with six cyber security and systems courses. The common thread is the ""Teaching Hospital Model"" -- hands-on courses involving real-world projects with law enforcement, the intelligence community and critical infrastructure owners and operators, and strong collaboration with embedded government personnel. <br/><br/>The program components are designed to have a broad and lasting impact. Existing efforts to engage members of underrepresented groups and non-traditional students will be intensified, and arrangements to accept community college graduates will be expanded. CyberCorps(R) students will collaborate on real-world projects with federal agency personnel to gain practical experience and enhance internship and job placement prospects. Other innovative aspects of the proposal are (1) diverse studies, ranging from computer science and chemical engineering to business and law, all built around a strong cybersecurity core; (2) flexible program components that prepare students for careers in intelligence, research, operations, project management, enterprise security, and law and policy; and (3) integration of traditional, non-traditional and underrepresented students in an inclusive and collaborative learning culture. The project will also offer sustained mentoring and student involvement in community service and outreach activities."

To realize such systems requires a deep understanding of the interfaces between the cyber and physical worlds, leading to the establishment of the field of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). While CPS as a discipline and application-enabler has evolved tremendously over the past decade, current graduate training does not sufficiently prepare students for fundamental discovery and innovation in CPS nor for effective translation of research to application development. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Virginia (UVA) will address this need by training graduate students to pursue fundamental CPS discovery and innovation and to collaborate with application domain experts to realize a smarter planet, specifically in the areas of smart health, smart cities, and autonomous systems. The traineeship anticipates training one hundred fifty-eight (158) master's and doctoral students, including thirty-three (33) funded PhD trainees, from civil and environmental engineering, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, and systems and information engineering.<br/><br/>Current CPS graduate training is lacking in three critical ways that will be addressed in this project. First, current courses do not instill the integrative knowledge needed for new scientific discovery and translational applications in the field of CPS. Second, most students do not have a sufficiently robust experience of convergence activities as part of their training. This lack exists not only in traditional engineering and computing education but also extends into analyses of target application domains and associated grand challenges. Third, explicit professional development is absent in most graduate training. Such exposure is critical in CPS given the field's potent role in our ever-evolving smart world, and CPS practitioners must attend to social issues regarding ethics, safety, privacy, communication, and policy. This traineeship will address these issues and drive CPS graduate education nationwide by developing a novel, comprehensive graduate training program that involves orientation, normalization modules, elective courses, experiential convergence research activities, professional development workshops, and a hands-on, testbed-driven educational curriculum. Students will acquire both the technical depth and the integrative transdisciplinary understanding of CPS and its associated application domains to be successful in CPS-related careers. During their time in the program, trainees will engage in transdisciplinary CPS research on projects related to challenges in smart health, smart cities, and autonomous systems.  These research efforts have the potential for significant scientific and application impact, such that a smarter world can be achieved and associated societal grand challenges can be addressed.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graduate education in engineering typically produces engineers who are highly competent technicians, but who may lack the ability to understand and successfully navigate those contexts.  Important skills that may help engineers bring contextual perspectives into their problem solving include the ability to integrate across disciplines, to devise solutions to poorly-defined challenges, and to recognize and address broader societal and global issues.  This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to Texas Tech University will test an approach designed to change the way graduate students in engineering conceptualize and reason about their work to better prepare them for real-world complexity.  The project will use innovative methods, informed by arts and humanities education and grounded in the learning sciences, to help students become more reflective thinkers who have greater awareness of the complex, broader contexts of their work. <br/>                                                   <br/>The project will employ arts- and humanities-informed learning activities within the engineering curriculum to help students better understand the social and community aspects of engineering by becoming more reflective thinkers.   The curriculum will include activities such as visual thinking strategies to develop observational skills, computer-simulated ethical/moral dilemmas to prepare for real world complexity, and team projects to practice reflective engineering.  The purpose of these techniques is to enhance reflective reasoning and connect that reasoning to engineering.  This project will assess how the curriculum changes the student's ability to think reflectively, how the curriculum changes the way the student thinks about the role of engineers within a societal context, and what factors limit or enhance the ability of the student to benefit from the curriculum.  A mixed-methods approach will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention including surveys, formative peer assessment, interviews, narrative inquiry, and textual analysis.  The teaching and learning techniques that are the most effective in building reflective reasoning will be identified and refined and the results will be used to strengthen and broaden the impact of the curriculum. Publications and workshops conducted for other faculty and teaching-assistants will be used to disseminate the key findings from the project and aid translation of the research to other settings and institutions.  The ultimate goal of the research project is to create an impactful, evidence-based curriculum that educates future engineers who are committed to serving the public not only with technical engineering skills but with a mindfulness of the complex social, cultural, and environmental contexts impacting their work.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.  The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project will take important steps towards defining comprehensive curricular standards for cybersecurity education and its outcomes can potentially transform cybersecurity education in the US and internationally. The project includes the full participation of academia, government and industry stakeholders throughout the development process and in key leadership roles. It also recognizes that the development of a strong cybersecurity workforce is a global concern and the project invites global contributions to curriculum development efforts.<br/><br/>The Cyber Education Project (CEP) was started in 2014 with the dual goals of(1)establishing curricular guidelines for undergraduate cybersecurity programs that are endorsed by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the IEEE Computer Society; and 2)developing discipline-specific criteria that would lead to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Cyber Sciences accreditation. The work to be performed through this proposal addresses mostly the first goal - it will establish curricular guidelines for cybersecurity undergraduate programs that are endorsed by major global computing associations - but it will also inform the ABET accreditation process. The activities and deliverables will include organization of the International Security Education Workshop in June 2016 and disseminating the associated workshop report; a curricular volume providing guidelines for cybersecurity undergraduate programs; and roadmaps to guide the implementation of the curricular guidance for a range of constituency groups. The project plans for broad community engagement across the range of academic constituencies - to include computing disciplines, social and behavioral science disciplines, and applied content areas. It will also provide a continuous formative assessment and adjustment throughout the curriculum development process."

Research themes focus on three major challenges that society faces with abrupt climate change: threats to global security, reductions in ecosystem services, and adaptation in social systems. Novel training elements of this program include a collaborative interdisciplinary research project, and a policy and management internship with organizations that span international, federal and state agencies, as well as the private sector. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The risks of abrupt climate change are globally pervasive and include increased numbers of environmental refugees and political conflicts over resources. Determining how to anticipate, avoid, and manage abrupt climate change was recently identified as one of the five grand challenges to global sustainability. This IGERT award trains the next generation of scientists to meet these environmental and social challenges. To promote future recruitment of a diverse science workforce, all IGERT trainees will conduct outreach activities with K-12 students from underrepresented groups. The program also fosters a strong international perspective through research collaborations as well as internship experiences abroad.<br/><br/>IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to establish new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, and to engage students in understanding the processes by which research is translated to innovations for societal benefit.<br/><br/>"

Training students to work with multiple stakeholders, such as non-profit organizations and local populations could better prepare them to address problems that involve multiple disciplines or perspectives.  For example, humanitarian organizations are engaging both STEM professionals and members of affected populations to design innovative interventions for refugee relief and response. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will train STEM graduate students to adopt more collaborative and inclusive approaches to problem-solving within the humanitarian response context. MIT D-Lab, which focuses on Development through Discovery, Design and Dissemination, will expand its contributions to the humanitarian relief sector through a novel approach to teaching graduate-level design and systems thinking courses.  The goal is to train future STEM leaders to incorporate a more inclusive and participatory approach to problem solving. MIT D-Lab will develop, pilot, and evaluate a multi-week module on how to effectively facilitate co-creative design sessions that include both humanitarian organizations and affected populations on the design team throughout the entire process. While the module is being developed and tested within the context of D-Lab?s humanitarian efforts, it has applications in many other settings, both in academia and in the field.<br/><br/>Researchers will develop and pilot elements of the design and systems thinking module in D-Lab, the Systems Design and Management program and the Urban Risk Lab at MIT; in the Humanitarian Engineering program at Oregon State University; in the Program on Forced Migration and Health at Columbia University; and in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. In parallel, students will work on a semester-long project with a partner organization (such as Oxfam, UNICEF or the Red Cross) to develop a co-creative activity between the organization and an affected population. After the class, students will have the opportunity to work with D-Lab staff and partners in the field to deliver the co-creative activity. The researchers will measure learning outcomes for the curriculum and identify changes in the students? skills, knowledge, and attitudes. In addition, researchers will determine the effectiveness of co-creation processes and will compare the activities developed as part of this project to the current process for identifying solutions and engaging users in the humanitarian sector. By comparing these processes, the team will be able to identify important hypotheses about effective ways to teach co-creation and participatory principles as well as the effects of a co-creation process on students and refugees. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The traditional career pathway for PhD students in the sciences, leading to a faculty job, is no longer reliable. Numerous recent reports have called on universities to provide better career development and preparation to help these highly-trained scientists and engineers go on to productive and satisfying careers in a broader range of job sectors. To create the necessary culture change and provide these resources, institutions need cost-effective, easily adaptable models that can transform from the bottom up. The PhD Career Ladder Program is a student-led career mentoring program that takes students through an eight-step curriculum of self-assessment, career exploration and preparation for a job search. Because the program is grassroots and peer-to-peer, it creates a supportive space for exploration of career paths inside and outside of academia and encourages persistence toward students' career goals. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) Track to Stony Brook University will focus on expanding, improving and institutionalizing the PhD Career Ladder Program, and testing its effectiveness as a career development tool.<br/><br/>This award will allow Stony Brook to expand the existing PhD Career Ladder Program (PCLP) to new cohorts and develop standardized training for new peer leaders. The success of PCLP will be assessed through evaluation of its impact on participants as well as the effectiveness of its programmatic elements. Key measures include increasing student career knowledge and skills, enhancing students' confidence in their career prospects, transferable skills and job-search skills, broadening students? career horizons to include the pursuit of careers beyond academia, and cultivating a pipeline of new student leaders. The assessment also will measure research-grounded psychosocial variables such as shifts in scientific identity and perceived identity compatibility with diverse career pathways. The program, including the new train-the-trainers component and the expansion of PCLP to new student cohorts, will be assessed formatively throughout the project as well as summatively at the end of the project. Finally, findings on this highly adaptable and cost-effective model will be disseminated broadly, through an online clearinghouse of archived material and a program implementation toolkit.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Innovations in Graduate Education Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education."

Understanding how neural activities and circuits drive human computation, behavior, and psychology is motivated by a critical societal need to address brain diseases that involve disruptions or deterioration of neural circuitry - including Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Recent scientific discoveries and powerful new tools in brain research have inspired broad student interest in career paths focused on understanding brain structure and function, as well as new industrial and academic career opportunities. Neurophotonics is among the most rapidly evolving research frontiers in brain science because it allows researchers to monitor and influence neuron activity and neural circuits at their most fundamental level. A prominent neurophotonic technique is optogenetics, through which communication signals from neurons are precisely monitored, activated, or inhibited using light. This project will support training for eighty (80) PhD students, including twenty (20) funded trainees, across the disciplines of neuroscience, biomedical engineering and photonics.<br/><br/>Trainees will become versed in the biology of neural function and the development of optical instruments, photo-excitable materials, and imaging techniques to sense and affect neural circuits. NRT trainees will graduate having attended a hands-on neurophotonics technology boot camp, participated in multiple laboratory research rotations, completed a four-course core curriculum, conducted challenging doctoral research in a neurophotonics laboratory, and written a neurophotonics-themed dissertation co-mentored by NRT faculty. The traineeship project will emphasize immersive experiential learning activities and peer-to-peer learning, two educational approaches that have been shown to reinforce learning while simultaneously improving outcomes for STEM trainees, especially underrepresented minorities. Interwoven with educational activities will be a professional preparation program that supports trainee career goals, develops communication skills, and builds professional networks. Trainee learning objectives will focus on identifying important research problems in neurophotonics, applying light-based methods to measure and control neural circuits, working on team-oriented projects, and communicating effectively.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

Although university faculty often collaborate across disciplines, most PhD students are still trained in single departments and have little opportunity to work in interdisciplinary teams. Moreover, interdisciplinary courses for undergraduates are not common, so undergraduates are rarely exposed to the power of interdisciplinary problem-solving before entering a graduate program. A lack of interdisciplinary undergraduate courses also creates few opportunities for graduate students to teach in interdisciplinary settings, even though one of the best ways to learn a topic is to teach it. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) Track to the University of California, Santa Barbara, will address these challenges by developing, enhancing, and assessing a recently developed model of interdisciplinary graduate education (Crossroads).  The model will engage faculty and graduate students from multiple disciplines in a yearlong research project that is transferred into the undergraduate classroom. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students to apply multiple disciplines in problem solving, and will be especially attractive to students from under-represented communities who are eager for tools, such as interdisciplinary research, for solving the world's grand challenges. This project will result in the creation and dissemination of a suite of effective, transferable, and scalable professional development activities addressing interdisciplinary teaching and research, which have been evaluated, refined, and tested in a variety of STEM areas.<br/><br/>This project will supplement the existing Crossroads program with a suite of new activities (open to all graduate students) that will provide explicit training in interdisciplinary scholarship and communicating that scholarship to broad audiences. For example, the project will develop workshops that help students articulate and discuss what it means to conduct research ""in a discipline"", to productively collaborate within an interdisciplinary research group, and to effectively communicate science to diverse groups. In addition, Crossroads students will complete a graduate pedagogy course with modules on teaching in an interdisciplinary classroom and on including authentic research in the classroom. The core Crossroads model and the new enhancements will be tested through the in-depth analysis of five Crossroads group projects (two in the area of sustainability and three across all STEM areas). An evaluator will conduct interviews, focus groups and surveys of students and faculty to assess whether participation in Crossroads improved the students' ability to apply approaches and tools from multiple disciplines to solve research problems, work in interdisciplinary teams, and communicate research to individuals outside the discipline.  These assessments will be used to refine the approach as subsequent projects are developed.

At present, six out of ten people live near the coast and are susceptible to hurricanes, tsunamis, and other hazards. Coastal and other hazards also threaten economic and geopolitical stability, and national security. Hurricanes Sandy (2012) and Katrina (2005) and the Tohoku tsunami (2011) and Typhoon Haiyan (2013) are reminders of the immense long-term impacts such hazards pose. Despite the accelerating risk of such events, resource allocations and coping strategies are often complicated and by varying stakeholder interests. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to Virginia Tech will synthesize expertise in science, engineering, planning, and business to address the critical issue of growing disaster losses attributed to both natural and man made hazards. The program will train a new community of multi-disciplinary researchers, practitioners, and leaders at the master's and doctoral levels. Over five years, the project will support 26 trainees on NSF stipends, and an estimated 150 additional students will participate in at least one element of the program. Each trainee will pursue a degree through existing academic entities at Virginia Tech or through the university's new Individualized Interdisciplinary PhD program. <br/><br/>The project will develop new transdisciplinary approaches critical for advancing knowledge and understanding of disaster-resilience and risk management across different STEM and non-STEM disciplines. The involved faculty are not only experts in their own disciplines, but also have a shared history of transdisciplinary disaster-resilience and risk management research and education. Trainees will work with faculty and each other to develop innovative, comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable methods and practices that seek to mitigate disasters emanating from natural and manmade hazards. Trainees will also learn about and lead stakeholder engagement exercises that explore how people and institutions respond to disasters and risk. Integration of student research with stakeholder interaction and engagement provides a novel and potentially transformative educational component that could be replicated in other transdisciplinary graduate programs. Intentional training in the societal context in which disasters unfold has the potential to deepen communications among disaster-resilience and risk management professionals and researchers and the communities they serve. Educational innovations include i) integrating research and education through a unique approach to stakeholder engagement, ii) emphasizing intentional development of transdisciplinary thinking, and iii) integrating faculty and graduate students into a community of practice that fosters diversity and inclusion. The result will be diverse, globally competitive scholars who understand the fundamental aspects of disaster resilience and its broader implications outside traditional STEM fields.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs."

This project, a cross-institutional collaboration among North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and Davidson College, capitalizes on advances in technology to respond to that challenge.  It aims to provide empirical evidence on the enhancement of foundational physics concepts of pre-service elementary school teacher candidates, key players in the development of the STEM professional workforce, using haptically-enabled science simulations (HESSs).  Haptics is an umbrella term for the sense of touch (in this case virtual touch).  The HESSs are virtual representations of real-world systems, displayed visually, and augmented with haptic force-feedback.  Users can physically interact with multiple (often invisible) components of the modeled system (in this case) forces.  The project team's underlying premise is that if soon-to-be teachers (re)learn core physics concepts more deeply, they will be empowered to provide richer learning opportunities for their students.  This project will provide pre-service elementary school teachers access to ideas (in physics) and tools (technological and pedagogical) with the potential to influence how they approach the teaching of basic physics concepts in the elementary grades, as their students are just entering the STEM pipeline. <br/><br/>This project targets two intertwined focal areas of the EHR Core Research (ECR) program: STEM workforce development and STEM learning and learning environments.  Building upon prior work involving HESSs, this project will work with undergraduate pre-service elementary school teachers to examine implications for the use of HESSs during their preparation. The project team will investigate pre-service elementary school teachers' understandings of forces as interactions (a foundational concept in physics) and the influence of haptic force-feedback technology.  The project adopts an embodied cognition perspective in the design, building, and testing of its intervention.  It uses a mixed-methods approach to examine the interfaces between teaching and learning and the mediation of STEM learning through fundamental use-inspired research.  The design, develop, and testing research cycle will include focus groups, usability testing, and small-scale pilot testing.  The pilot testing will use a pretest-posttest control group design with random assignment into two groups, haptic vs. non-haptic simulations.  This research has the potential to provide foundational knowledge for a new model of teaching about core physics concepts in the form of HESSs.  Project goals are to (1) add foundational human-computer interaction knowledge to guide the design, development, and testing of HESSs, (2) isolate and document the haptic influences on the development of teachers' specialized content knowledge of forces as interactions, and (3) study the pedagogical impact of the HESSs on pre-service elementary school teachers.  In addition to the benefits to the pre-service elementary teachers who participate, this project will train graduate research assistants and involve undergraduate students in cutting-edge STEM research, which also has the potential to contribute to STEM workforce development.  Project findings will be used to develop a set of design guidelines for the haptic-augmentation of science simulations that can be used by other researchers.  Moreover, cross-institutional and cross-disciplinary partnerships, such as this project, may enhance the infrastructure for STEM education and research.  This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports fundamental research in STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By contrast, STEM graduate education research has not yet developed sufficient frameworks (e.g., journals, conferences). This has led to inefficient dissemination of evidence-based approaches and challenges for implementation of effective practices. This National Science Foundation award to the University of Massachusetts Medical School will support a workshop that will seed action to develop resources and frameworks for disseminating evidence-based educational approaches for doctoral STEM education, with a particular focus on effective practices for PhD career development, a rapidly growing field within graduate education that has urgent dissemination needs. The workshop will serve to cultivate a multi-stakeholder community with shared concerns, a passion for graduate education, and a desire to advance educational practices that enhance the career preparedness of PhD scientists. The priorities and next steps identified through this workshop will seed future initiatives and enable STEM doctoral programs to more effectively and efficiently address the training needs for the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The one-and-a-half-day workshop will focus on an area that is consistently highlighted as a need in national reports on STEM graduate education, but which has received little attention: the lack of a national infrastructure for coordinating and curating dissemination of materials supporting innovative doctoral educational models. The workshop will bring together stakeholders with expertise spanning dissemination, evaluation, career development, and graduate education, to define actionable next steps for enhancing the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based educational approaches for PhD career development. This workshop will use panel presentations, stakeholder-focused group discussions, mixed-expertise small group discussions, and full group report-outs to define the most critical issues and recommended actions for dissemination of evidence-based practices. The workshop will generate a list of the needs, challenges, and barriers to dissemination and implementation of educational models, informed by the diverse viewpoints of key stakeholder groups, and will identify a list of recommended next steps, including how each stakeholder group can contribute to enhancing evaluation and dissemination of approaches. The workshop will result in a report synthesizing findings, including actionable next steps focused on individual, stakeholder group, and national efforts. This report will help stakeholders take informed action in a coordinated manner to avoid redundancy and amplify investments.<br/><br/>This proposal is funded by the NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program.  The NRT Program (17-585/18-507) is designed to encourage the development and implementation of new, potentially transformative models or approaches for STEM graduate education training that address changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, IDPs have been adapted to support the career and professional development of graduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Despite an interdisciplinary consensus that IDPs, when used properly, provide a framework for helping graduate students achieve their career goals, there is little alignment among STEM disciplines and institutions about the specific, measurable outcomes of IDP use. This knowledge gap inhibits the availability of reliable effective practices for IDP use and its wide adoption among educators. This National Science Foundation Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) award to the American Chemical Society will help define core goals for the IDP process used across STEM disciplines and help develop tools that measure the impact of IDPs on the professional development of graduate students in STEM. The project outcomes will catalyze the generation of evidence for effective use of IDPs - evidence that is needed to scale the use of the IDP process, support and inform additional investments in career planning and graduate education, and foster growth of the field of PhD career development. Ultimately, results from this project have the potential to improve educational outcomes in graduate education and to better prepare the U.S. workforce. <br/><br/>This project will work nationally across STEM disciplines to align activities associated with implementing and measuring the impact of the IDP process, fulfilling three project objectives: (1) define core goals and measurable outcomes for the IDP process; (2) develop and test a set of instruments for demonstrating changes in student actions and attitudes resulting from use of the IDP process; and (3) recommend strategies for building a base of evidence on how and why the IDP process works in various contexts. The innovation of this project will be a tool-kit - a collection of standard impact indicators, a set of validated instruments, and guidance on their use - to be used across the STEM graduate education community. Initial drafts of the instruments will be created based on prior research, interviews with a range of STEM stakeholders, and feedback from career planning professionals and assessment experts. The collection of psychometric surveys and other tools will be pre-tested using cognitive interviews, field-tested with students from various graduate programs and backgrounds, and pilot-tested at selected campuses with a statistically relevant number of graduate students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Stakeholder interviews, input from gatherings of subject matter experts, insights from and surveys of those attending discussions with and presentations to the STEM graduate education and career development communities, focus groups of graduate students, and results from use of the tool-kit will be among the methods used to test two project hypotheses: (1) a set of instruments can be developed to measure the impacts of the IDP process as it is used in different ways to guide students with different backgrounds, experiences, and career goals; and (2) engaging a range of stakeholders, nationally and at academic institutions, in developing and testing this set of instruments will form a cadre that is interested and invested in using the project findings, resources, and recommendations to build a broader and more robust research base on the effective use and impact of the IDP process on graduate students. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Qualified students from related fields also are welcome, including Electrical Engineering, Information Systems, Mathematics, Physics, Education, and Public Policy.<br/><br/>Students at the UMBC Center for Information Security and Assurance engage in mentored research projects at partner organizations, including Northrop Grumman, JHU Applied Physics Lab, Convergent Technologies, DoD Cyber Crime Institute, Parabal, and the UMBC Office of Information Technology.  Research opportunities exist at many UMBC labs, including at the UMBC Cyber Defense Lab, where current projects include digital cloud forensics, forensics visualization, high-security voting systems, and delay- and disruption-tolerant networks for a solar system Internet.<br/><br/>This project is increasing the number of qualified professionals in cybersecurity, which strengthens American security and competitiveness. To enhance quality in cybersecurity education, in years 2-4 of the project, UMBC is hosting a one-day regional public workshop focusing on innovations for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate cybersecurity education.  To attract and retain minorities and other underrepresented students, UMBC's SFS effort cooperates closely with UMBC's nationally recognized Meyerhoff Program, Center for Women in Technology, and other university organizations."

Currently, the demographic composition of the student body in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) doctoral programs and the scientific workforce is not only different from the composition of U.S. demographics, but it is also changing more slowly than the demographic shifts in the US. It is important to address these inequities in order to create a robust domestic scientific workforce, which may contribute to a healthy economy and promote U.S. scientific superiority. Inherited practices for recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students contribute to these inequities, as does the lack of opportunity for faculty to reflect upon their practices in these areas. This award creates innovative systems by which faculty can improve those practices, and therefore holds significant promise as a strategy for broadening participation in graduate education and the scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The project will form a network that provides faculty and graduate school administrators within and across the University of Southern California and University of California campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara with opportunity and incentives to critically reflect upon and change longstanding practices. Participating STEM PhD programs will receive professional development from project leaders in the form of workshops and continuous learning activities on recruiting, admitting, and mentoring graduate students from diverse backgrounds. Leaders that emerge from each program in years 1 and 2 will be selected to establish campus-level teams who will deliver similar faculty-to-faculty learning opportunities on their own campuses. The research and evaluation activities of the project involve a sequential multi-method study, including the first-ever clustered randomized experiment to test the impact of faculty development around three outcomes: the admissions practices that PhD programs use, the diversity of their admitted cohorts, and the programs' selectivity. The structure of the network allows for sustainable gains, and it works with, rather than against, the decentralized nature of graduate education and its varied institutional and disciplinary contexts. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

These resources will be designed to be easy to deploy and will be interactive, competitive and collaborative to ensure student engagement.  The availability of these resources will make it easier for computer science faculty with little prior background to teach security across, and will increase the number of schools teaching cyber security concepts.  As a result this project will produce more students with the analytical skills required to secure computing assets in the Pacific Northwest and in turn will help to ensure American technical competitiveness in the future. <br/> <br/>The resources will be linked to the concepts and learning outcomes defined in the IEEE/ACM CS Curricula 2013 report.  Support for these resources will be provided by a student-run help desk and a user interface that will allow faculty to modify exercises to fit the content  and level of difficulty of their classes.  Background material will be provided for students to make the exercises applicable to a variety of computer science classes.   These resources will fulfill four important needs: (1) expanding and disseminating technology ? improving exercises using EDURange,  a flexible, cloud-based teaching infrastructure, (2) faculty development ? helping them use hands-on security  exercises in their classrooms and providing curricular resources, (3) student engagement ? developing their skills,  leveraging their talent and knowledge, and mentoring them to become the next generation of teachers and researchers, and  (4) education research --investigating the acquisition of analytical skills.  <br/><br/>Assessment of the resources will focus on four activities:  (1) a quantitative evaluation and summary of how often and how widely the resources are used, (2) a qualitative assessment of how well exercises map or express the cyber security knowledge units of CS2013, (3) an assessment of faculty experience using the resources in their courses, and (4) an evaluation of the experience using the resources by security faculty, professionals, and students."

MVSU is an HBCU in the heart of the Mississippi Delta. In this effort, MSU will conduct faculty development summer workshops on the MSU campus for MVSU faculty. Together, MSU and MVSU will develop curricula that support Security+ certification of MVSU students. MSU will also work with MVSU to enhance MVSU's high school computer science summer camp program.   <br/><br/>MSU's Center for Cyber Innovation proposes to work with MVSU's Mathematics, Computer and Information Sciences Department and MVSU's Center for Cyber Security. This partnership will provide commercial cyber certification opportunities for MVSU faculty and staff. MSU will facilitate this goal by developing and delivering a review course for the certification exam. By making the certification review material publicly available, MSU and MVSU seek to promote cyber security education capacity and economic development in the Mississippi Delta and beyond. A key early outcome of this effort is to establish a pipeline for MVSU students to be awarded scholarships through the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at MSU to pursue graduate studies. Longer term, MSU will assist MVSU in becoming certified through the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) jointly sponsored National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (CAE-CD) program.

This is a major concern because irrigated farms contribute to approximately half of US crop sales, greater crop yields, reduced poverty, affordable food, and positive health and nutrition outcomes.  Water conservation alone is not enough.  Unconventional water resources must be used, but the overwhelming barrier is energy cost. The energy sector is undergoing a significant transformation as a result of the incorporation of renewable wind and solar energy. There is an opportunity of increasingly available renewable energy to provide inexpensive and plentiful water for water-stressed agricultural lands.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Texas at Austin will train a new generation of students to develop transformative and globally relevant solutions to use unconventional water resources for agriculture by harnessing power from renewable energy and recovering energy-containing resources from ""dirty"" water.  Technical skills alone are insufficient to advance these efforts, so trainees will be taught to think critically, understand technical, financial and societal challenges to technology implementation, and communicate complex ideas freely, and at the appropriate level, with stakeholders from all walks of life. The project anticipates training a diverse cohort of thirty-six (36) MS and PhD students, including eighteen (18) funded trainees, from engineering, geosciences, and public affairs.  <br/><br/>Project goals are to develop and institutionalize a new model in STEM education that directly supports and informs research activities, professional development, and societal improvement; to develop transformative water solutions for agriculture through interdisciplinary research; and to enhance graduate student and workforce diversity.  The new educational model consists of five program elements: (1) four core courses plus a food-energy-water systems (FEWS) seminar, (2) personalized professional development activities in communication, management, entrepreneurship, and job preparation, (3) dual-faculty and alumni mentoring of trainees, (4) FEWS-relevant internships, and (5) local public service. The courses and seminar will be institutionalized through a new FEWS certificate program, and the professional development activities will become a permanent institutional element through a portfolio program. A key novelty of the traineeship is complementing classroom knowledge with experiential learning through internship and public service.  The research effort will advance disruptive technology development in new materials, water treatment processes, and renewable energy sources; decision support modeling for integration of energy and water treatment processes; and global assessment of policy and technology diffusion.  Diversity will be enhanced by outreach and recruiting at four minority-serving institutions in Texas, and through direct collaboration with Prairie View A&M University, where trainees will engage with faculty and undergraduates to do field work in sustainable agriculture.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training.

Historically, hands-on cyber security exercises helped students reinforce basic concepts, but most of them focused on user level attacks and defenses. Since OS kernels provide the foundations to the applications, any compromise to OS kernels will lead to an entirely untrusted computing. Therefore, it is imperative to teach students the practice of kernel level attacks and defenses.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, there has been great interest in using virtualization to profile, characterize, and observe kernel events including the security incidents. Inspired by the great success from virtual machine introspection (VMI), this project aims to provide an advancement by directly building practical VMI tools and libraries (or toolkit) on top of virtualization, and applying them for deep cybersecurity education. The deepness comes from the study of the lower level system internals such as OS kernels. The project will further provide a number of seed contents to teach both instructors and students on utilizing the toolkit to be used for studying not only traditional user level attacks such as buffer overflow, but also defenses inside the OS kernels. The outcome of this project (i.e., the toolkit and the cybersecurity exercises) will contribute to the health, safety, and economic well-being of our society by helping to improve the state-of-the-art in cybersecurity education, especially for effectively performing hands-on cybersecurity exercises."

Historically, hands-on cyber security exercises helped students reinforce basic concepts, but most of them focused on user level attacks and defenses. Since OS kernels provide the foundations to the applications, any compromise to OS kernels will lead to an entirely untrusted computing. Therefore, it is imperative to teach students the practice of kernel level attacks and defenses.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, there has been great interest in using virtualization to profile, characterize, and observe kernel events including the security incidents. Inspired by the great success from virtual machine introspection (VMI), this project aims to provide an advancement by directly building practical VMI tools and libraries (or toolkit) on top of virtualization, and applying them for deep cybersecurity education. The deepness comes from the study of the lower level system internals such as OS kernels. The project will further provide a number of seed contents to teach both instructors and students on utilizing the toolkit to be used for studying not only traditional user level attacks such as buffer overflow, but also defenses inside the OS kernels. The outcome of this project (i.e., the toolkit and the cybersecurity exercises) will contribute to the health, safety, and economic well-being of our society by helping to improve the state-of-the-art in cybersecurity education, especially for effectively performing hands-on cybersecurity exercises."

The research team will follow a sample of biology Ph.D. students through their final stages of graduate school and into early years of their scientific careers to determine which skills acquired during graduate education might predict and facilitate postdoctoral attainment and scholarly productivity. The project also will provide novel insights into inequalities in early career researchers' (ECR) trajectories and outcomes and inform policies and interventions aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of graduate training and postdoctoral support mechanisms. <br/><br/>The overarching framework for the study is Social Cognitive Career Theory. The research team proposes to integrate the social cognitive, socialization, and economic and sociological lenses to conduct a longitudinal study of 286 Ph.D. students as they complete their degrees and enter the workforce in the biological sciences. They will investigate four hypotheses: (1) Professional trajectories within the cognitive, community, and organizational careers of ECRs will reflect ""Matthew Effects"" in which small initial differences account for increasingly large differences over time. (2) Research skills, self-efficacy, and organizational career goals during graduate school will jointly predict initial attainment and persistence in a postdoctoral position. Variance explained by these factors for subsequent career trajectories will wane over time, and variance explained by indicators of successes within the community and organizational careers will increase. (3) The features and opportunities associated with postdoctoral positions will predict both linear and geometric trends in subsequent cognitive, community, and organizational career trajectories of ECRs, as well as persistence in a research career path. (4) Professional trajectories within the cognitive, community, and organizational careers of ECRs, including persistence in a research career path, will vary as a function of interactions between sociodemographic characteristics, skills development, and environmental factors. The researchers will use longitudinal structural equation modeling to estimate and characterize trajectories within each career type and to quantify anticipated ""Matthew Effects"". Longitudinal structural equation modeling also will be used to understand how trajectories are related to each other and to participants' skill development, motivational factors, and graduate/postdoctoral experiences, as well as how trajectories could vary by demographic characteristics. They will estimate a latent growth curve model for this purpose. The research results could generate new insights and interventions for diversifying the scientific workforce by facilitating more equitable outcomes.<br/><br/>The project is supported by the ECR program that emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.  ECR supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
